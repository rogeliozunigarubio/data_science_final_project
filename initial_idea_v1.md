Brief Background:

Our client, the sustainability team of a major airline, has been tasked with exploring the connection between environmental investment in certain tourist destinations in the caribbean and traveler perception of those destinations. There are already other consultants working on quantitate analysis relating to an airline industry metric of seat/fuel/mile to specific destinations, we want to try and analyze a possible connection between traveler reviews/tweets and destination appeal due to perceived environmental factors.

We are hypothesizing that there is a relationship between sentiment scores of tweets/reviews and perceived environmental condition of a destination.

Concretely I want to perform sentiment scoring of tweets and reviews for a list of destinations that are relevant to the client and compare them to the seat/fuel/mile quantitative analysis performed by the other team


What is the question you hope to answer?

Identify traveler sentiment trends over time to explore possible correlation between environmental factors/events (seaweed event 2011 and 2015, co-ordinated beach cleanup efforts, etc.) and reviews and posts on social media networks (Twitter, Tripadvisor)

What data are you planning to use to answer that question?

Text and geo-location data from Twitter and Tripadvisor reviews for given locations

What do you know about the data so far?

Twitter posts are geo-tagged, people express opinions when traveling and posting their travels
