g1006573,d1102010,February 13 2016,This is an experience that should not be missed. Well cared for horses lovely beach easy going guide. We stopped the horses on a secluded beach and removed the saddles. We then rode bareback walking the horses into the ocean until they were swimming before returning to shore. Lovely.
g1006573,d1102010,February 13 2016,
g1006573,d1102010,February 13 2016,The horses are well cared for and well behaved. Our group had both experienced and inexperienced riders and everyone had fun. I got to canter on the beach even though the rest of the group didn't want to. We would definitely go with them again.
g1006573,d1102010,February 13 2016,I had the most wonderful time riding with Pampered Ponies : reconciling my 2 passions : the sea and horses. bareback swimming is a unique experience ! loved it !
g1006573,d1102010,February 13 2016,We have horses at home and wanted to ride on a beach. The horses were well cared for unlike in st. Lucia. The guide was nice..took pictures and told us about the island. There's lots of beach to run and play on. The horses were safe and well trained. Lori was very nice and you can tell she cares.

g1006573,d1102010,February 13 2016,The guide and ride was great. Communication was not the best. They use public transportation and didn't make then clear to use (how are we supposed to know what bus to get on). Make sure that they make it very clear to you.

g1006573,d1383025,February 17 2016,I enjoyed my private beach ride along the beach with Paul. Horses were well behaved and I felt totally safe. Would recommend.
g1006573,d1383025,February 17 2016,Definitely worth it! Was one of the best experiences I've had on the Island. If I could I would do it every day!! The horses are very easy to handle and overall it was a lovely experience!

g1006573,d1383025,February 17 2016,This was the best Swimming with the horse we have ever done and we have done many. We went for a ride December 24 with my 3 teenage kids and my 9 year old Paul was our guide. Paul is amazing  a great guide very nice knowledgeable and attentive! I would absolutely recommend this place !

g1006573,d1415235,March 4 2016,We didn't have time to stay and swim with the Dolphins but we were allowed to watch the others do that. It was definitely worth the stop and walk through the gift shop. Food was available as well.
g1006573,d1415235,March 3 2016,It was very fun and safe. My daughter loved it! It went by so quickly we were having so much fun. Awesome
g1006573,d1415235,March 3 2016,Dolphin experience was great. The way they have you buy pictures is hi-way robbery they should wear masks it would make the experience more realistic( the robbers not the .....)

g1006573,d1437338,February 12 2016,Great for "old folks" AND kids. This cruise was for wife's 70th B'Day and this excursion was a highlight. Dolphin Encounter and Sting Ray Envounter both exceeded expectations. Awsome!
g1006573,d1437338,February 8 2016,Capi and his trainer were great and the kids were so excited to kiss hug and ride the dolphins. the look on their faces was priceless
g1006573,d1437338,February 8 2016,
g1006573,d1437338,February 4 2016,Best shore excursions! The staff made it very personalized patience with kids and handicap people! Thumbs up! I would recommend to everyone!
g1006573,d1437338,February 3 2016,This is a great experience. One of the highlights of the vacation. Photos they take are really good albeit expensive.
g1006573,d1437338,February 3 2016,A small group from our cruise ship went here; took turns having the dolphin Nemo pushing us on a boogy board holding fins and letting each one hold on and belly swim. Then we got to hold and kiss him and he kissed our cheeks. The photos they took were pricey but I did buy.

g1006573,d1989109,March 5 2016,This was my second visit to Grand Cayman and my second visit to the USS Kittiwake! Love the accessibility huge entrys and exits and the history!
g1006573,d1989109,March 4 2016,Plenty of cutouts/swing through so specifically made for divers to explore ship. Very easy to get to and plenty to see. It is a newer wreck (purposely sunk) so the coral and growth are still young but there are plenty of fish and the expirence is top notch.
g1006573,d1989109,February 29 2016,We snorkeled all around the ship and the schools of fish were plentiful. The colors of the fish and the variety more than met our expectations and to be that close to a ship was a lot of fun. We did see a lot of scuba divers who went into the ship. Not for me!
g1006573,d1989109,February 28 2016,This is a must do if you are in the Grand Caymans for diving. The ship is huge with numerous cutouts that let you enter the interior at various points and without fear of getting lost inside.
g1006573,d1989109,February 24 2016,
g1006573,d1989109,February 22 2016,Very good dive and nice to be able to go inside a wreck with lots of room would do again for sure. Nice warm water and plenty of time to look around. Pick your times wisely for its very popular dive site and can be congested.
g1006573,d1989109,February 20 2016,I'm glad that I got to dive the Kittiwake. My husband loves wreck diving me not so much. This was a real treat. There was so much to see on this dive.
g1006573,d1989109,February 15 2016,This was my first dive on a ship. Pleanty of big cuttouts with lots of light inside. Crystal clear water with great visablility.
g1006573,d1989109,February 13 2016,Kittiwake is pretty rad. Visibility is excellent. You can swim in and out of the ship safely. The fish who make their home there are colorful. We are glad we made this dive in Grand Cayman.
g1006573,d1989109,February 12 2016,I've dove around the world and this is a great wreck dive! Fun to move around within the holds and areas. It's big with lots of marine life hanging around. Great visibility. Quick and easy boat access. Go with Dive Tech!
g1006573,d2173510,March 10 2016,
g1006573,d2173510,March 10 2016,Up close view of these beautiful creatures well worth the visit. Well organized and informative. Your kids will love it.
g1006573,d2173510,March 9 2016,
g1006573,d2173510,March 9 2016,We really enjoyed this nature park. Nicely layed out and kept up. We really enjoyed the snorkeling with the fish and turtles and feeding birds in the aviary. The only negative was the lack of good service at the restaurant. The food was pretty good however. Would definitely recommend.
g1006573,d2173510,March 9 2016,
g1006573,d2173510,March 9 2016,We only visited the turtle section of the Farm but it was well worth the experience. The size of some of the turtles is impressive and the opportunity to hold a sea turtle was the best.
g1006573,d2173510,March 9 2016,
g1006573,d2173510,March 8 2016,the turtle program was ok just interesting how they breed the turtles for consumption so the wild ones are not harmed. I found it very informative. Beautiful areas very clean.
g1006573,d2173510,March 7 2016,Are you an animal lover? Love pets? The turtle farm was a fun low key activity. A little over priced. However show proof of your taxi ride with the right company and you'll get in for a significant discount. Fun for all to hold the turtles. You'll learn a little history and breeding of the turtles.

We rode for an hour and 1/2 along a gorgeous beach and then through a quiet wooded area back to the starting location. If you would like a fun safe adventure make a reservation with Nicki.

g1183186,d1486707,March 3 2016,A great time for our four teenagers started with a quick lesson/refresher from Jari and Ryan then a few hours of fun in the surf. Highly recommend it.

g1183186,d1486707,February 12 2016,I rented a board for 10 days the service was great. Flexible reasonable and staff were grounded genuine and helpful. If you are surfing in Barbados check in with Barrys. James from Toronto.
g1183186,d1486707,February 9 2016,It was our third year on the island and second year with Christie and Barry for surf lessons. Great Teatcher warm welcome and really fitting into our needs. I will keep trying standing up on my board ( even if I am a 40++) ; our son remembers very well Jordan s advices and looks forward coming back next Christmas.

g1183194,d555825,March 4 2016,Beach was nice and in a great location. It does get a little crowded but there was still room for everyone. You can rent umbrellas and chairs. We swam here and the water was not too rough.
g1183194,d555825,February 27 2016,The beach is nice and big with toilet/cleaning facilities located right by it. Always nice. The truck that serves a roti (and also other food) is a little bit pricey but you do get a lot. Planes fly right overhead and it is close to the bus station
g1183194,d555825,February 27 2016,Miami Beach is a wonderful sand experience especially for kids and families. The little small cove off the main beach is a great spot for splashing in the sea.
g1183194,d555825,February 26 2016,Lots of joggers and yoga exercising going on so if you are interested in that then this is the place. Good beach with lots of shade. Good food from Mr. Delicious Food truck. It was a great day.

g1183194,d555825,February 17 2016,Just around the corner from Oistins main beach this litle beach has a calmer bay as the waters do not crash directly onto it as it does on the main Oistins beach. Has its own fast food place etc.

g1183194,d555825,February 8 2016,Lovely clean beach with plenty of shade. The water is calmer than some of the other beaches (so great for kids or non-swimmers). great street food located in the car park which is a fraction of the price of some of the restaurants. toilets and showes also available.
g1183194,d555825,February 7 2016,We talked to several tourists who visited many beaches on the island and this was their favorite. Great for small children and those who want to swim in calm waters.
g1183194,d555825,February 7 2016,Nice white sand. Waves can be a bit rough at times - you can walk over to the calmer side protected by the breakwater and swim there if waves aren't your thing. Good facilities - bathrooms changing facilities food carts shade trees and beach chair/ umbrella rental. Nice laid back vibe. Everyone is friendly.
g1183194,d555825,February 7 2016,Nice easy waves.. Great for young kids and the older kids alike. Great local food and drinks from beach vendors that don't harass you and from Mr. Delicious.. a converted restaurant bus! We would stay for hours in the warm gentle waters and on the soft sand beach with some shade trees!
g1183194,d555825,February 7 2016,Two areas one very calm and one lively with good waves busy on weekends as it a favourite for local family picnics. Monday to Friday it's easy to find a spot. Great sunsets!!!
g1183194,d555825,February 7 2016,
g1183194,d555825,February 7 2016,This is the go to place for locals and tourists alike  it is everything you want from a Caribbean beach....
g1183194,d555825,February 7 2016,Places to park friendly locals. Beautiful sand and water so clear you can see your toes. I love it here. Could return day after day!
g1183194,d555825,February 7 2016,My favourite beach on barbados. Lots of local use this as there are picnic tables at the rear of the beach. Toilet Facilities okay but showers are bit tatty but fit for use Chairs and umberellas for hire. But be early. It gets busy. Great takeaway van for bajan fish balls
g1183194,d555825,February 7 2016,
g1183194,d555825,February 7 2016,great beaches to chill...always go to beach 1st before do anything else on the island. prefect beach... Nice little food van to get some fish cakes..! locals are friendly..
g1183194,d555825,February 7 2016,This is a nice beach in Oistins with nice side waves but very swimmable. There are ample places to sit in the shade even with the beach crowded by natives and tourists. Sand is beautiful. White with highlights of pink. Easy walk from Oistins fish market.
g1183194,d555825,February 7 2016,I love it! Plenty of waves if you like them or swim in the bay if you prefer calmer water. Great facilities. Turquoise waves white/pink sand.
g1183194,d555825,February 7 2016,This beach is a joy to visit and there are public changing rooms available with public outdoor showers available.Very clean with lots of natural shade available

g1183194,d555825,February 7 2016,This is really a beautiful beach but Iwhat I like most about the beach is that the local people also come to the beach and you get a chance to meet the real Barbadian folks. Take your family have a wonderful day. Lots of eateries around. And an excellent car park.
g1183194,d555825,February 7 2016,The locals organised cleanup days and the seaweed which was deposited by a storm was removed to restore what is otherwise a very good beach and very convenient for Little Arches guests.
g1183194,d555825,February 7 2016,Great beach...picnic tables available. Great for families. Love this beach. Waves r aggressive but so beautiful. Mr delicious truck there if u wanna buy good food and rum punch. Definitely recommend this beach for everyone
g1183194,d555825,February 7 2016,Nice quiet beach adjacent to Oistins beach. Lots of shade available to spend the whole day here. Usually great flat sand for walking or jogging (2015).
g1183194,d555825,February 7 2016,I've been in Barbados since September 7( will leave in October 9 ) with my wife for 5 weeks. I didn't like Barbados actually and Miami was not that great actually. Dirty and smells like rotting eggs...
g1183194,d555825,February 7 2016,Lovely little beach very calm water to swim there are sunbeds to rent on the main beach but we visited the little beach nearest to Oistins.
g1183194,d555825,February 7 2016,

g1183194,d555825,February 7 2016,Miami beach was walking distance from my airbnb and it had the feeling of being your own private beach. The beach is clean wide spread and just was a wonderful morning and evening spot.
g1183194,d555825,February 7 2016,This beach was walking distance from where I was staying so every morning I walked to the beach and sit and have my coffee- my very own beach.
g1183194,d555825,February 7 2016,I called in at Oistins beach in July 2014 on my hire car travels round the island and found it a very chilled place to visit apart from 1 beggar who insisted he was homeless he had better trainers on than me!!! I really enjoyed the day I sent here.
g1183194,d555825,February 7 2016,Such a beautiful beach but sadly its being affected by masses of seaweed! White sands and home to the famous Mr Delicious (a battered food van) that serves good Bajan food and drinks. We didnt stay long because you couldnt swim or sunbathe on the beach :(
g1183194,d555825,February 7 2016,
g1183194,d555825,February 7 2016,this is a great beach it has everything you need food water alcohol and loungers to rent but get there early because they are rented fast

g1183194,d555825,February 7 2016,Unusable --- MOUNTIANS of red seaweed makes the beach unusable seaweed never bothers my family we are in love with the ocean and everything in it but....this is ridiculous there is way more seaweed then beach and literally 20 foot piles all over the place we drove in looked and drove out ..
g1183194,d555825,February 7 2016,
g1183194,d555825,February 7 2016,This is the beach ainsley harriot was on when he did his food show and I've been there. This is a suntrap of beauty. Clean ample space and food and drink available. Again an array of people from locals to holidayers and people selling coconut shell gifts theyve made that day.
g1183194,d555825,February 7 2016,This is a lovely beach for families and is close to bus stops so transportation is easy if you don't have a car
g1183194,d555825,February 7 2016,
g1183194,d555825,February 7 2016,We found ourselves here very early in the morning on a drive around the island had this little piece of paradise to ourselves. There is a small lagoon area that is sheltered from the waves natures perfect swimming pool. Would recommend this for families picture perfect.
g1183194,d555825,February 7 2016,Great clean beach with plenty of shade and crystal clear water. after a dip you can get a rum punch and cutter from Mr. Delicious.
g1183194,d555825,February 7 2016,On our trip to Barbados we went to Miami Beach twice great beach and had lunch at Mr Delicious Snack Bar thoroughly enjoyed our two days at this beach. There were several benches with seats under the trees if you wanted to shade from the sun.

g1183194,d555825,February 7 2016,Has free parking and lots of shade. 1 beach has waves. The other faces a different direction and doesn't have waves. Sand and water are perfect. There is a food truck for when you get hungry.
g1183194,d555825,February 7 2016,liked the location sea temp and easy access view local transport. you could hire sunbeds and umbrellas
g1183194,d555825,February 7 2016,Went there on a Friday planning on heading to the Fish fry after. Waves are perfect for boogie and body boarding.

g1183257,d1868421,March 10 2016,I would give it 6 stars if I could. It is definitely one of the most beautiful places I've ever visited with such kind hospitality!
g1183257,d1868421,March 10 2016,
g1183257,d1868421,March 10 2016,
g1183257,d1868421,March 10 2016,Set in a sunken gully Mr Hunte has created a tropical paradise containing rare specimens that are ablaze with colour and aromas. Well maintained paths but lots of steps lead to views that have been carefully created in a confined space. Well worth the visit .
g1183257,d1868421,March 10 2016,
g1183257,d1868421,March 10 2016,This beautiful garden would be a wonderful place to spend many hours. There are many quiet seating areas to sit and be grateful. Anthony himself greeted us at the door and obviously loves people and sharing his work of art. The homemade lemonade with ginger and carrot cake wer delicious. Loved it! Take a taxi as bus service is unreliable.

g1183257,d1868421,March 8 2016,Have been to Barbados quite a few times in the past and never been to Huntes Gardens before. What a fantastic place made even better by meeting the owner who was happy to chat to us. A must do while on the island

g1310451,d148299,March 10 2016,
g1310451,d148299,March 10 2016,This is amazing and something you won't be privileged to see in too many places in the world. We took the tram tour but they offer some really interesting other tours as well. The guide was excellent and it was very educational. Definitely a must do while in beautiful Barbados
g1310451,d148299,March 8 2016,This is an impressive experience and lasts for just the right amount of time. We did the tram tour which lasted for about 50 minutes. Definitely worth going to see if you've not been before.
g1310451,d148299,March 7 2016,We did the 1 hour tram tour and it was amazing. The ceilings in the caves do drip water so you must be careful with your cameras and other electronics. The water does not stain clothes. There is a WOW-factor that cannot be described and must be experienced.
g1310451,d148299,March 7 2016,
g1310451,d148299,March 5 2016,
g1310451,d148299,March 5 2016,A must see in your lifetime. An amazong experience. From the lift that you take to the short presentation and to the train ride. When we paid USD 30 to enter I told the cashier that it was too expensive but when the tour finished not only was it worth every cent but I understood why it was so expensive.
g1310451,d148299,March 5 2016,The caves were not my thing but the quality of the experience cannot be denied. The tour equipment was in excellent condition and the caves were meticulously and knowledgably presented. I just wasn't into them but the tour setup was great.
g1310451,d148299,March 5 2016,The cave is an amazing place to visit. No worry about walking there's a tram to ride. It can get cool inside so a light wrap will be a comfort. Check out the new restaurant too.

g147248,d152546,March 10 2016,
g147248,d152546,March 10 2016,We went on the land Rover tour. The staff was great. It is a bumpy and dusty ride but lots of fun. Our driver Jorge was wonderful. One of the vehicles broke down but the staff never missed a beat and all was well.
g147248,d152546,March 10 2016,The half day land rover tour was amazing! Our guide Matthew was the best!! He was energetic knowledgable and made the trip a blast! You get to do multiple activities in one trip- explore the popular sites in Aruba and snorkel in the natural pool. Highly recommend especially with Matthew as your guide!
g147248,d152546,March 10 2016,
g147248,d152546,March 10 2016,Be prepared for a whole lot of bump and grind with Angie and the guided tour. She really can handle herself and took me places I would have never gone alone. This is not for the faint of heart but a real off road adventure. Will refer friends.
g147248,d152546,March 10 2016,
g147248,d152546,March 10 2016,
g147248,d152546,March 9 2016,
g147248,d152546,March 9 2016,Did the half day Land Rover tour and it was great. Our guide Renso was the best really took care of us. Good overview of the island. This tour is really a must!
g147248,d152546,March 9 2016,Great time on this UTV tour. Exploring Aruba was so much fun. Richi our guide was so informative and made the day so much fun. I highly recommend this tour if you are visiting Aruba!
g147248,d310833,March 10 2016,
g147248,d310833,March 10 2016,Visited the Butterfly Farm in March 2016 and it was so gorgeous. We took the educational tour and it was very informative. The best part of the time there was having them land on you and see them flying around highly recommended as a spot to visit!
g147248,d310833,March 10 2016,Quite enjoyable and lovely staff. Not a big commitment of time. Good excursion on the day after you get sunburned very badly ... It happens ....
g147248,d310833,March 10 2016,Great place was awesome to see the butterfliesnot expensive & it was a nice break from the sun for a few hours!
g147248,d310833,March 10 2016,We visited in the afternoon and spent quite a while having them explain what was happening with the butterflies and then returned in the morning as that is when they are really active and it was an amazing experience have done other farms on other islands since
g147248,d310833,March 10 2016,Low cost trip and what a peaceful and delightful thing too do in Aruba. You can take a bike ride there from the Tamarjin.
g147248,d310833,March 9 2016,
g147248,d310833,March 8 2016,The people who work here are welcoming and very informative. It's a small spot but it's full of beauty and has good photo opportunities.
g147248,d310833,March 8 2016,
g147248,d310833,March 7 2016,Beautiful flora butterflies from around the world. From mating to eggs to caterpillars to chrysalis to butterfly they have it all to see. Loved the people in the shop they were awesome! Hi from the butterly tattoo girl from Louisiana!
g147248,d310833,March 7 2016,We visited the Butterfly Farm on a bus tour. Quite interesting to hear about the short lives of butterflies! Thanks a lot.
g147249,d1066829,February 27 2016,
g147249,d1066829,February 27 2016,Stick to the tried and true crepes. My wife's was a good crepe with fruit; mine was an awful tiny pile of nondescript 'seafood'.rolled in a crepe; no savoury sauce to get it down. Staff was friendly. Others said they enjoyed their crepes.
g147249,d1066829,February 27 2016,
g147249,d1066829,February 27 2016,We stayed at the Old Mill hotel a nice inexpensive hotel and this is on the grounds so it is a natural photo op. Interesting if you haven't seen a Dutch windmill. Easy to get to and very near many of the high rise beach front hotels so it is good for a quick stop.
g147249,d1066829,February 27 2016,As a tourist destination it's not much because it's a non-working windmill. However as a nightspot with a DJ and a 6 a.m. license it's a great dance club. During the day if you come by stop by Diana's Pancake Place which is next door from the windmill for the BEST Dutch-style pancakes EVER!
g147249,d1066829,February 27 2016,I went here with my wife because it looked fun from some of the reviews. Total waste of time. I am a fun expert but this place was boring. Boring scene people avoid and save your time for everything in Aruba that IS fun.
g147249,d1066829,February 27 2016,The best after hours spot on the ISLAND. On the weekend this open air bar god until sun up! Really good DJS spinning all facets of House. Party with the friendly locals when they get off work from the other bars and clubs. Lots of cabs to get you home safe!
g147249,d1066829,February 27 2016,If you're not into going to a place to see a deactivated Windmill/Nightclub you will not like it. I went because it was part of our tour. Not interesting attraction.
g147249,d1066829,February 27 2016,If you've never seen a windmill up close before do go and see this one. But if you've been to East Anglia Belgium or Holland before don't bother. This is a windmill with a bar in it sat square in the middle of a parking lot surrounded by fast food and hotels. No charm whatsoever.
g147249,d1066829,February 27 2016,This was practically opposite the hotel I was staying at and I had to walk to the windmill to find out more. It was closed but was a local tavern. It looks great and makes a great photograph.
g147249,d1066829,February 27 2016,It's nice to see the old windmill but that's it. There isn't much too it. It isn't a working windmill so my kids and I were disappointed that we couldn't go inside it. We basically stood in the parking lot and took a few pictures but that was it.
g147249,d147446,March 10 2016,
g147249,d147446,March 10 2016,This lighthouse was very interesting from a historical stand point. It is under renovation at the moment. Not sure if under normal circumstances you could climb to the top. It is nice to see that Aruba maintains their historical sights. The view is amazing and worth the visit
g147249,d147446,March 9 2016,We didn't do anything by the lighthouse the views are beautiful the restaurant has great food and beautiful scenic views of the ocean. Make sure to go there for Sunset just beautiful
g147249,d147446,March 9 2016,We opted for a taxi tour and the driver took us here. It was a beautiful drive but the lighthouse was under construction. The view was beautiful.
g147249,d147446,March 9 2016,We went on 5 1/2 hour tour of the island. This was our first stop. It is being renovated right now. I still enjoyed learning about the history of why the lighthouse was built. I would like to see what it looks like when the work is done.
g147249,d147446,March 9 2016,
g147249,d147446,March 9 2016,
g147249,d147446,March 9 2016,Made the effort to visit the lighthouse only to find that it was covered in scaffolding and missing the top. Really was a waste of a trip. We had a quick look around the restaurant gardens but a real flop!
g147249,d147446,March 9 2016,Visited the lighthouse as part of a cheap ($25) bus tour of the island. Lighthouse is under scaffolding for renovations. Views were nice. It was named for the SS California. I was unaware of the history of the SS California until I took this tour. Very interesting.
g147249,d147446,March 8 2016,The california lighthouse was under construction when we were in Aruba not much to see but the scenery is very nice. It is worth going only if you want to see Aruba from a different side (little mountain).
g147249,d147446,March 8 2016,I am a lighthouse collector I love this place. Unfortunately the lighthouse as of Feb. 2016 is under a reconstruction The whole top was missing and scaffolding was all around it and people were working on it. Yet the view from the sight was amazing and could take your breath away. Kind Regards Friscoboy
g147249,d147452,February 23 2016,
g147249,d147452,February 23 2016,We booked an excursion through Roberto's for a lunch/snorkel sail. So worth it. Hundreds if not thousands of fish swim near this ship wreck and swim all around you. If you have an underwater camera don't forget it! I will never forget this!
g147249,d147452,February 23 2016,
g147249,d147452,February 23 2016,Nice snorkeling site - we reached it via catamaran tour. Lots of fish to see - multiple sizes and colors.
g147249,d147452,February 23 2016,
g147249,d147452,February 23 2016,
g147249,d147452,February 23 2016,We used Aqua Windies for this dive and they did a great job. An interesting dive. The depth goes down to about 90 feet.
g147249,d147452,February 23 2016,We snorkeled here twice on this trip and it was amazing. There are so many different fish starfish etc to see as well as the ship wreck. Definitely recommend do this.
g147249,d147452,February 23 2016,
g147249,d147452,February 23 2016,i also went to the Riu Palace Antillas beautiful place to stay excellent service beach magnificient beautifu grounds i do recommend this place for sure
g147249,d147452,February 23 2016,We have the opportunity to go to see the antilla by snorkling but it looks better on photos because it looks like its fading away. I overheard a tourist saying that each year it goes a couple of meters deeper.
g147249,d148239,March 5 2016,
g147249,d148239,March 5 2016,
g147249,d148239,February 27 2016,We walked along the north west shore and really enjoyed this beach. There are very few points to enter the water and no hotels so bring all your own refreshments supplies etc. The water here is very clear and calm. A great snorkling beach.
g147249,d148239,February 23 2016,Nice place to enter the water if calm and snorkel your way up or down beach. there is only a small opening between the rocks. No one sells water or snacks so bring your own. Saw lots of small fish and start fish too
g147249,d148239,February 16 2016,Malmok Beach is great for snorkeling and wind surfing. Very rocky bottom but beautiful crystal clear water
g147249,d148239,February 14 2016,
g147249,d148239,February 14 2016,The tours call by here as its good snorkelling you can park above on the cliff sea access is easy enough no food/drink really some shade as usual reef walkers appropriate worth a few hours.
g147249,d148239,February 8 2016,This is another good snorkeling beach but not that big but a good beach. Do go there while in Aruba.
g147249,d148239,February 8 2016,Nice little beach away from the high rise area. Not such a crowded beach and a good spot for snorkelling right off the rocky shore.
g147249,d148239,February 8 2016,Better have on swim shoes here. The beach is small and rocky. The water bottom is mostly coral rock. There are better beaches for families on the island.
g147249,d148239,February 8 2016,Clean and tranquil beach. Wonderful spot to swim and snorkel. Hardly any waves and plenty of fish to see.
g147249,d148729,March 10 2016,
g147249,d148729,March 10 2016,Took the Safari Jeep trip nice trip throughout the island since its not a big island you can take one of the day long trips and see practically everywhere in Aruba.
g147249,d148729,March 6 2016,On a calm day once you get past the rocky bottom you can snorkel all along the shore. On a windy wavy day you can only sit in the sun and admire the water from afar. No chairs to rent. This is one of the most beautiful spots.....
g147249,d148729,February 27 2016,Unless you are a great swimmer and are willing to dive in and swim past the rocks you cannot enter the water from this point. But it is a gorgeous beach and the water is crystal clear.
g147249,d148729,February 18 2016,This place has a rather small beach. Beautiful setting but lots of places to hurt your feet. If you are a good swimmer it is perfect. There is about a 50 foot area great for families with small children. Plenty of parking and palm tree umbrellas available free.
g147249,d148729,February 14 2016,Opportunity to snorkel by the shore able to park car on the cliff access is easy enough the day tour boats call by because there are plenty of fish always to be seen the island buses do use this route as well. No food/drink there really.
g147249,d148729,February 9 2016,The terrain is so unique. We stopped here on a motorcycle tour. So glad we did. Tons of pictures taken
g147249,d148729,February 9 2016,Access to reef snorkeling via beach. We swam here as part of a catamaran tour. Lots of fish and crystal clear water.
g147249,d148729,February 9 2016,Went here two times on our last trip. Have been about 15-20 times--always fun. Easily accessble with only a car and completely free. Easy shore access too. Other snorkelers saw a nice barracuda there this trip.
g147249,d148729,February 9 2016,Palapas right by the water on this tiny beach. Very calm little cove perfect for swimming and snorkeling.
g147249,d148729,February 9 2016,Had to stop here & take a bunch of pictures. What a great view! Pelicans diving for fish & cool rock formations.
g147249,d148915,March 10 2016,
g147249,d148915,March 10 2016,We took the bus for $2.30 each one way to this beach. You need to get there before 10 to assure getting a tree/shelter. Absolutely beautiful clean beach! great for snorkeling. Several beaches close by within an easy walk.
g147249,d148915,March 9 2016,This is a beautiful beach but get there early if you want shade or one of the umbrellas. It's worth the visit and only 5 minutes from High Rise Hotel district.
g147249,d148915,March 8 2016,This is a nice beach with warm waters. Great place to snorkel especially for beginners. Only drawback is that there are large rocks on the left side of the beach.
g147249,d148915,March 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,March 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,March 7 2016,
g147249,d148915,March 5 2016,We rented a car and headed up LG Smith to Arashi Beach. Even though there were bus loads of people there was plenty of room to park. We plopped our towels in the sand and headed to the waves! The beach slopes quickly. Not necessarily a good snorkel spot it sure was fun to play! We slept hard that night!
g147249,d148915,March 1 2016,Overall this is the best beach I have ever been to. White sands decent snorkelling free palapas friendly people not crowded an ice cream truck decent vegetation shallow area for young ones no boats plus Pelicans!
g147249,d148915,February 28 2016,Great beach very nice clear water. The fact that the water is shallow makes it also great for children. This is one which i do recommend others to visit.
g147249,d148915,February 27 2016,I love this beach because the water was the warmest anywhere on the island that we found. We did a lot snorkeling there as well. Beautiful fish. There are also areas of shade an event someone didn't want to spend all day in the Sun.

g147249,d148915,February 25 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 25 2016,This was my favorite beach in Aruba. The waves are big but not dangerous. My wife and I swam here for a couple of hours then ate lunch under a palapa. We watched two young kids at the beach slightly north of us surfing. This beach is not suitable for young children.
g147249,d148915,February 25 2016,much better beach then where the hotels are. Water is nicer and there is room on the beach. it is a stop on a lot of the bus tours so it can get a little crowded but just for the short stop they make.
g147249,d148915,February 25 2016,This looks like a good beach to snorkel. We didn't have snorkel stuff with us. We were disappointed that the snack bar and bathrooms were not open.

g147249,d148915,February 21 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 21 2016,This was the most beautiful calm water white sand swim out as far as you can standing for 40 feet out beach I have been to on this Island and we've visited a LOT. Shade for those that want it sandy bottom light wave water is the best. Do not miss this beach.
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,Its a drive from a hotel zone but definitely worth it. Water much more clearer than in Eagle Beach. Plenty of fish around you and there is always a friendly pelican fishing around you. Beware no facilities. Also one of the best sunsets on the Island.
g147249,d148915,February 18 2016,This beach is at the tip of the island. Pretty but the sand is not as smooth as other beaches. The water was clear though.
g147249,d148915,February 18 2016,We have visited a few of the islands beaches so far and Arashi has been our favorite. There is a huge sandbar in front that stretches out quite a ways. There are nice waves for the kids to play in and it was not crowded. We very much enjoyed ourselves.
g147249,d148915,February 18 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 18 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 17 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 17 2016,Loved it! Beach chairs and umbrellas for rent. Also has Palapas (huts) and one designed for handicap! Lots of palm trees! Bring your cooler and snorkel gear and you are set!
g147249,d148915,February 17 2016,Secluded and very private. Safe for kids and adults. Pictures beach but without any facilities. Great for a couple of hours if you have a car....but you can not have a good holidays on Aruba without a car anyway!
g147249,d148915,February 16 2016,Very convenient as are all Aruba beaches. Parking free as is typical. Snorkel right off the beach. No real services but worth a half day at least.
g147249,d148915,February 16 2016,Awesome quiet beach with few huts and couple of miles away from High Rise so most people who come here are locals or tourists staying in-land. Bathrooms were locked in the morning so not sure if there are any restrooms.
g147249,d148915,February 15 2016,There are several large huts for shade and restrooms. Beach chairs are available for rent. There is also ample parking and a wheelchair accessible hut.
g147249,d148915,February 15 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,Good location at top of the island car park shallow sandy beach various sun cover and lounger options does not have the food and drink options the more crowded and popular beaches have.
g147249,d148915,February 12 2016,Beautiful beach with chairs for purchase and umbrellas. Easy parking. Only downfall was no plAce to buy food or drink. Very nice
g147249,d148915,February 9 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,A really beautiful beach that is also good for snorkeling. It is to bad that the bath house that was built is not open.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Making arashi beach larger for swimmers also. Beautiful spot to watch kite surfers sunsets and snorkelling
g147249,d148915,February 7 2016,Really enjoyed this tranquil beach away from the High Rise crowds. Great place to snorkel and watch pelicans fish.
g147249,d148915,February 5 2016,We've been watching construction here going on for a couple years. It looks like they may have rest rooms. A rarity on Aruban beaches. Everything was locked when we went. A nice beach with parking area. Enjoy the beach without hotels in the background.
g147249,d148915,February 5 2016,Great beach. Stopped in to be in a very swimmable serene beach with ambiance. Caught bus after and it wasn't a long wait. Nice blend of light waves and calm clear waters.
g147249,d148915,February 5 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 5 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 5 2016,Get there by 10 am to get a palapa far less crowded than the other beaches. No facilities. Rocky getting in and out of the water but some of the best off shore snorkeling on the island. Good for finding shells and sea glass and the peace and quiet made it our "go-to" beach.
g147249,d148915,February 5 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 5 2016,This was on the north part of the island away from the crowded beaches by the hotels. We brought our own snorkel gear and had a blast. Starfish anchovies blue trumpetfish and many other fish were plentiful.
g147249,d148915,February 5 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 5 2016,Great beach for watching birds dive for their dinner great snorkeling to left just look for catamaran tied off shore! Wonderful soft cool sand! Great for all ages can get rough at times! Get there before 10 am if you want shade! They do rent lounge chairs!
g147249,d148915,February 5 2016,I was taken here by an island tour for a brief amount of time and it wasn't as crowded as most of the other beaches. The water was a bit rough but nice and warm. There were several shaded posts to nestle your belongings by while you take a dip. I mostly enjoyed the island's Divi trees on the shore!
g147249,d148915,February 5 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 5 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 5 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 5 2016,A very good beach for swimmingsnorkelling and shallow beach dives as well as for just sitting and soaking up the sun .
g147249,d148915,February 5 2016,Easy to get to park close to the water nice sandy beach not crowded gradual water slope public free public Palm umbrellas and fairly clean. Exposed to constant wind but so is most beaches.
g147249,d148915,February 5 2016,Nice beach- plenty of room for sunbathing and swimming. No waves although I recommend beach shoes for going into the water due to shells and shifting sands - really helps getting in and out!
g147249,d148915,February 5 2016,This is by the lighthouse and it's clean with very friendly staff to rent your chairs and umbrellas. Good snorkeling near by.
g147249,d148915,February 5 2016,

g147249,d148915,February 5 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 5 2016,While my favor beach is Eagle Beach this one is also good one.Nice and clean.Not too crowded .Recommended.
g147249,d148915,February 5 2016,My husband and I brought our 10 month old son to Arashi beach several times during our stay in Aruba because it was so clean picturesque and not crowded at all. There is great snorkeling nearby (complete with a shipwreck right offshore) lots of cabanas for shade and the north west side of the island boasts terrific views.
g147249,d148915,February 5 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 5 2016,This beach is very nice and clean. It has enough parking area and you can rent chairs  we spend the afternoon and enjoyed it very much!
g147249,d148915,February 5 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 5 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 5 2016,Stopped here on a tour. Gorgeous beach great water (Aruba's alwaysca little chilly compared to the Florida Gulf though). Definitely worth coming to for a day at the beach.

g147249,d150325,March 10 2016,
g147249,d150325,March 10 2016,We stayed on the beach at the Manchebo Beach resort. It was a great beach and I enjoyed relaxing in the beach everyday. The water was beautiful and the sunsets were great.
g147249,d150325,March 3 2016,
g147249,d150325,February 24 2016,Stayed at Manchebo Resort - wonderful deep span of beach. Great for walking each morning clean loved it. Not the best for off shore activities as the water was rough here but beautiful.
g147249,d150325,February 24 2016,Surprisingly eagle beach was very long. Manchebo in the northern area was great! Much more secluded and private. Although it was cold that day good spot to layout and swim
g147249,d150325,February 22 2016,
g147249,d150325,February 17 2016,All the beaches is Aruba are simply amazing but this and Druif beach are unbelievable gorgeous. The sand is soft and white and there is no seaweed to worry about tripping about in the ocean. The water is so clear I went into up to my neck and could still see my feet!!
g147249,d150325,February 17 2016,Beech is virtually empty. One of the most beautiful beeches in the caribbean. Rare to fine a low rise hotel with spots that open onto beech for $430 a night.
g147249,d150325,February 16 2016,This is a beautiful beach. Bright white sand multicolored ocean and numerous palm trees. it is quiet and postcard picture spectacular.
g147249,d150325,February 14 2016,In the middle of the hotel area popular safe sand beach good swimming with various dining options on hand.

g147249,d150447,March 10 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 10 2016,We visited several beaches while in Aruba and while all beautiful we found Eagle Beach to be our favorite. Rental chairs and lounges for those that desire them. Incredibly beautiful views. Can't wait to get back.
g147249,d150447,March 10 2016,We loved this beach. The water was beautiful and it was quiet and relaxing. I would definitely go again for some fun in the sun!
g147249,d150447,March 10 2016,Eagle Beach is considered the second best beach in the world. Fine white powder sand and blue green crystal clear water.
g147249,d150447,March 10 2016,I stay on Palm Beach but we drive over to Eagle Beach because it is less crowded and the sand is softer!
g147249,d150447,March 10 2016,Fabulous beach you MUST spend a day at Eagle Beach one of the top 10 beaches in the world. Bring $30 for a lounge chair.
g147249,d150447,March 10 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 9 2016,Love Eagle Beach water is just beautiful quite. Aruba is in my heart. Can't wait to go back. Such a nice beach.
g147249,d150447,March 9 2016,This is truly a beautiful beach. Gorgeous clear turquoise water white sand magnificent breeze. But get up early to reserve a hut. Most mornings all were taken by 6AM!
g147249,d150447,March 9 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 9 2016,so clean and calm and safe..we walked all over day and night. food is great and the deli at the big grocery store is excellent.

g147249,d150447,March 8 2016,Beautiful beach the day I was there the waves were very strong. Did not experience this on other beaches.
g147249,d150447,March 8 2016,This beach is just amazing if you like a calm ocean. It is extremely long and beautiful. Not for me because of no ocean action to calm but absolutely stunning. Kind Regards Friscoboy
g147249,d150447,March 8 2016,Wonderful sandy CLEAN beach. Lots of places to relax and view the water. Need to exercise caution from the sun by using a good quality sun screen.
g147249,d150447,March 7 2016,Great beach; great water temperature. The current can be strong so be careful. Also you have to get to the beach early to reserve your "hut" and chairs. It's a very popular spot for all the right reasons. Aruba's Tradewinds don't blow sand in your face or anywhere! Heavenly place to hang!
g147249,d150447,March 6 2016,The quality of this beach is EXCELLENT. Not in love with the island but I would go back just for the sand!
g147249,d150447,March 6 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 6 2016,We were able to snorkel in front of our hotel on this beach. The water is so clear and the snorkeling is done in water you can touch in which is nice. The sand is white. You will love this beach.
g147249,d150447,March 6 2016,Best Beach ever. Can walk for miles and I spend a lot of time in the ocean. Wonderful experience . No one trying to sell you anything or braid your hair. Peace of mind and freedom to enjoy your holiday.
g147249,d150447,March 5 2016,Loved the temperature of the water and it was calm enough so we could all go into the ocean being we have some that are not good swimmers. The sandy bottom was spectacular.
g147249,d150447,March 5 2016,Beautiful white sand and miles of coastline to walk or run without feeling like you are intruding on anyone and the color of the crystal clear water? WOW!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,After a nice lunch at a near ny restaurant we went to the beach and sat down for 10 minutes. A guy came amd said he jad to put away the chairs at 430pm amd that it costs 10 USD for the chair. What beach closes at 430pm??? What about sunsets???
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Located on a beautiful beach very good accommodations Also a large variety of restaurants in many price ranges.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,We were right on Eagle most of the time less crowded and still have everything you would want. One of the best beaches in Aruba.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,This beach is the best beach in Aruba. ..no rocks deeper water and more room to spread out. And the best sunsets!
g147249,d150447,March 3 2016,Great beach for a day in the sun! Beautiful water and views and uncrowded. Not very good for snorkeling but the swimming is really good.
g147249,d150447,March 3 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 3 2016,This is a wonderful area - beautiful beaches great restaurants vibrant nightlife and plenty of shopping.
g147249,d150447,March 2 2016,Very nice beach. Weather is always nice and the beach is clean. A bit windy sometimes and the sand hurts a bit but one of the nicest beaches in the Caribbean.
g147249,d150447,March 2 2016,Access from the Timeshare we stayed in. The water was wamer than the pools and not crowded. Most folks along the beach lay in the sun baking rarely moving except to grab a drink! Just another great day in paradise.........
g147249,d150447,March 2 2016,Beautiful white sand and blue water. The surf was a bit rough on a few of the days during visit but still the very best beach in Aruba.
g147249,d150447,March 2 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 2 2016,I am from the Clearwater area the #1 beach in U.S. but this beach is the best i have ever seen in my life. cristal clear.
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,Beautiful lazy day on a beautiful beach. Very busy soft sand plenty to do very trendy. Part of a shore trip when crusing on Brtiannia. Wonderful. Hyatt Hotel allows use of their facilities. Beautiful Hotel. You have to see it for yourself to believe it. Well worth the trip.
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,Eagle Beach is one of the prettiest beach that I have seen. It's a wide beach with fine sand ocean sometime can be a little rough but overall it's a gorgeous beach.
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,Eagle beach is a beautiful place in the low rise district. The beach at Oceania is not overly crowded a pleasant place to enjoy great weather and water.
g147249,d150447,February 29 2016,I loved this beach!! White sand and clear water. Water sports very cheap. We went to the flip flop concertand it was so fun and secure. This beach is a must
g147249,d150447,February 29 2016,Eagle beach has to be the most beautiful beach I have ever seen. Clear blue water huge beach area. Very quiet. Peaceful and amazing!
g147249,d150447,February 29 2016,This beach is as nice as ever. Went at least 3 times on my stay. Water was good. Didn't use much of the extra activities. But next time.
g147249,d150447,February 29 2016,We have been coming here since 1981 and the beaches are the best! They are quite wide and have plenty of palapas for everyone.
g147249,d150447,February 29 2016,Quieter and less crowded than the highrise beaches. Nice bar and plenty of shade if you want it. White soft smooth sand. Did not note any rocks and just saw one seashell.
g147249,d150447,February 29 2016,Eagle Beach is a beautiful white sand beach that actually gets warm on the feet. It sits up high from the shore so the waves are a little more forceful when they recede back to the ocean--it makes for fun floating which seems to be what most people do. There are bars nearby for drinks.
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,We stayed at the Marriott Surf Club right on Eagle Beach. Could have not have asked for more! Cabana every day no problem. Beach beautiful.  not crowded - loved it!
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,The waters are very calm on this beach and clean. It is not very crowded and there some food venders nearby otherwise restaurants within the hotels. Porta potties are across the street by paradise beach villas. Chairs and umbrellas are for rent not sure on the price.
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,Absolutely loved this facility. Condo are very nice clean and spacious. The facilities are fabulous 4 pools work out facilities tennis and basketball courts. Beach is immediately across from the condos and are beautiful. Nice areas for walking. Easy access for shopping dinning and sightseeing.
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,Eagle beach is the widest stretch of beach on Aruba so there's plenty of room to spread out and not be right on top of other people. The water is perfect color blue/green and not cold.
g147249,d150447,February 27 2016,I tried walking this perfect beach every day I stayed in Aruba. The view and water was just perfect. The wter was clear for miles .
g147249,d150447,February 27 2016,Marriott breakfast buffet was amazing start to everyday amazing host yangie amazing views and beyond amazing food that had us full for awhile
g147249,d150447,February 26 2016,This is a secluded beach that is very peaceful and lovely. There was a bit of trash on the beach which is why I did not give it a 5 but the water and view is lovely.
g147249,d150447,February 25 2016,I like this beach but not My favorite in Aruba. Plenty of palapas and shade to find. Waves are calm here and a lot of people. My favorite beach in Aruba is Arashi
g147249,d150447,February 25 2016,Fabulous beach. Easy to find a relatively quiet spot if you wish to relax and/or swim. Beach is free and if you bring your own chairs the whole experience is free. Chairs are easy to rent. Plenty of water experiences if you desire.
g147249,d150447,February 25 2016,Yes this is a lovely strip of beautiful white sand but it is also wall to wall people. The cruise ships bring people there by the bus load in addition to people who are staying in the area. We preferred smaller beaches in the Malmok area over Eagle beach just too many people to navigate.
g147249,d150447,February 25 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 25 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 24 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 24 2016,spent many days on the beach walked up and down a couple miles daily for exercise beautiful spot will definitely go back
g147249,d150447,February 24 2016,Beautiful beach with crystal clear water. No seaweed. Not crowded like Palm Beach. My favorite beach in the caribbean.
g147249,d150447,February 24 2016,Eagle Beach was as nice as Palm Beach as regards the actual sand and water. I found Palm Beach to be somewhat more elevated in its attractions and the number of restaurants. Passions Restaurant was worth coming over for dinner.
g147249,d150447,February 23 2016,The beach from the Tamarijn past the Divi smelled like crap all day everyday. It must be sitting on top of a sewer because that smell is so foul! I could not believe that people actually woke up at 7 am to get their spot. I on the other hand ran by as fast as I could!
g147249,d150447,February 23 2016,Warm water. Wonderful sand. Plenty of activities on offer. This is close to paradise. Only problem is the crowds on the days the cruise ships come in.
g147249,d150447,February 23 2016,what a beautiful beach the sand is like silk the water is clear and a perfect temperature there are nice little shells to look at and it's relatively quiet
g147249,d150447,February 23 2016,The beach is so beautiful and all of the beaches are public in Aruba so you may go wherever you please. Everything is so clean and people are so nice.
g147249,d150447,February 23 2016,This beach never seems to disappoint. Each Year I LOVE It More AND more. The bottom is so smooth and water is simply wonderful
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,Eagle beach has different activities available. The beach is wide and clean no ocean debris and has great swimming
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,
g147249,d151063,February 6 2016,
g147249,d151063,March 9 2016,beautiful hotelgreat pool area and great service..we won big at the casino and service was awesome..have fun
g147249,d151063,March 6 2016,When we booked the trip the Casino was open however I think with the Barcelo acquisition it is closed for remodeling. The lobby bar is very small and has the best entertainment too bad they don't use this space for a larger bar and entertainment area.
g147249,d151063,February 24 2016,
g147249,d151063,February 24 2016,
g147249,d151063,February 6 2016,This was similar to most other casinos I have been it's busy crowded well when I was there lots of real gamblers here not like the one down the roaddid not enjoy it as much lots of smokers too not used to that anymore where I come from..
g147249,d151063,February 6 2016,We stayed at the Occidental Resort and got ready to go to the Casino our first night on the Island only to find out the it was closed down. No one seemed to know why it was closed just that it was closed. It would have been nice to know prior to our visit.
g147249,d151063,February 6 2016,
g147249,d151063,February 6 2016,We liked this casino 3 years ago this time it was very depressing and unwelcoming. They took out most of the fun modern machines and are using older ones. Plus everyone was playing Bingo and it was so quiet we felt like we were intruding in a private club and our slot machines making noises was disturbing to the locals.
g147249,d151063,February 6 2016,Having been in this casino a few times I have seen that it is not as clean a lot of the slot machines are old and it isn't even half as appealing as a place to go to as it was two years ago.
g147249,d151063,February 6 2016,not worth the money look for a hotel not under construction and better ocean views and better food!!!
g147249,d151065,March 10 2016,
g147249,d151065,March 10 2016,There were many choices. It was close to all. Nice inside. Seems like another good hotel to stay at for a week.
g147249,d151065,March 10 2016,
g147249,d151065,March 9 2016,Not much change . Same machines year to year. Tables are hard to get to and no $5 crap tables .Need for improvement
g147249,d151065,March 6 2016,The Hyatt casino is a small intimate space with the usual assortment of tables and machines. Unfortunately that means it can be crowded and smoking is permitted making off-peak hoirs a good time to visit.
g147249,d151065,March 3 2016,Hyatt casino is not as big big as some of the other hotels and is really smoky. Tables were not that lucky but the slots and quick hits were paying out.
g147249,d151065,February 27 2016,Great time met some friends over here had an awesome time. Love to play Let It Ride Here always have luck here with that game.
g147249,d151065,February 26 2016,This is a great place to visit after eating at one of the many fantastic restaurants on Palm Beach. I wasn't a winner but enjoyed stepping into this casino. My main complaint is that it has terrible ventilation. I expect some cigarette smoke but not to the point that I can't finish my one drink.
g147249,d151065,February 26 2016,The casino served its purpose for me and my husband to gamble and stay in the hotel. We did go to the Marriott Stellaris and they had a bigger nicer casino. I just wished they would ban smoking...but thats not their fault.
g147249,d151065,February 19 2016,The Hyatt Casino offered a $10 free play coupon which both my hubby and I took advantage of. We enjoyed playing the slot machines and my husband actually doubled his money. Woo hoo!
g147249,d151065,February 17 2016,upscale casino with OK dealers only one dealer ever talked to us. One woman never even smiled. They do get a big lively crowd.

g147249,d1524047,February 16 2016,Went there at sundown and saw three birds. Not sure what I should have expected but I went up in the viewing tower to see what I did. The area looks ideal as a site to attract birds but.....Was disappointed since I was loaded down with photo equipment.
g147249,d1524047,February 9 2016,
g147249,d1524047,February 9 2016,We went to this great little place near palm beach and climbed a observatory lookout to see birds and water like canals with a lot of greenery. We saw white egrets and some brown birds with red beaks and yellow legs. A really pretty place out of the way. Check it out.
g147249,d1524047,February 5 2016,They have an observation tower to view the birds which were noticeably absent the times we visited. It's free it doesn't take a lot of time stop by.
g147249,d1524047,February 5 2016,Not a whole lot for the kids here but it's a real nice spot to stop for a few minutes and take in what Aruba probably looked like before people settled and dominated the landscape. The quiet serene marshland of Aruba is a haven for wading and flying birds and there are tons to spot with the naked eye.
g147249,d1524047,February 5 2016,Had to walk around a bit to find the entrance. Thought there was a sign. Made our way to the observation tower. Seems like a hangout for the locals on siesta. no problems but could certainly use some tlc on the grounds.
g147249,d1524047,February 5 2016,This is a small water fowl reserve that presumably attracts numerous species. We saw one egret. Perhaps we were just there at the wrong time of year. It's close to the MILL so a few minutes to climb the viewing platform is something to do.
g147249,d1524047,February 5 2016,This area used to be better but now a lot of the area has been overgrown with weeds. You will be lucky to see birds. We noticed a lot of dead palm tree leaves being dumped around the road area.
g147249,d1524047,February 5 2016,
g147249,d1524050,February 29 2016,
g147249,d1524050,March 6 2016,Went here to the disco. Was the afterparty of the flip flop festival. The scene was cool the music good and the people fun.
g147249,d1524050,February 29 2016,Windmill near Mill Resort a piece of history - which is turned into a night spot after 11 pm. Also serves breakfast in the morning.
g147249,d1524050,February 23 2016,This was in front of my hotel--The Mill. A lot of country music. Drinks were OK. Nothing special. Walk down to Senor Frog or the other club hidden away behind the Marriott on the beach.
g147249,d1524050,February 23 2016,Pretty cool to see an authentic windmill but very touristy. We didn't go in just stopped by for a photo opportunity. Other reviewers have said Diana's pancakes is a great spot. (Beside windmill)
g147249,d1524050,February 23 2016,Walking along the waterfront and resort you can't miss the big windmill! The night life is especially great in this area being walking get distance of several resorts along this strip. Days are filled with shopping along the same strip to stopping get for a bite to eat and a cool drink. Try the "ollybollen" oh my tasty !!
g147249,d1524050,February 23 2016,Could see the windmill from our hotel/ resort. Also seen during our tour although the tour did not take time to get out. Seen through our windows....
g147249,d1524050,February 23 2016,Looks like a nice windmill and it would have been nice to have gone inside put think it is now being run as a club. Situated in a nice area
g147249,d1524050,February 23 2016,We had some drinks at this quirky lovely place we some friends. It had a great atmosphere and music and the drinks were cheap. It is a place where the tourists and locals can congregate together and plus its a popular spot which can bee seen for miles around worth a look!!
g147249,d1524050,February 23 2016,This beautiful windmill is vintage Dutch windmill. Non-working but still photogenic. Is currently the site of a nightclub restaurant type venue. Easily seen from the highway in Palm Beach. Easy to walk to from the high rise hotels in Palm Beach.
g147249,d1524050,February 23 2016,went had a great time Husbands dutch  he really enjoyed it  not much to see but it certainly sticks out.
g147249,d1526157,March 5 2016,
g147249,d1526157,March 7 2016,
g147249,d1526157,March 5 2016,When the sun was too hot we found escape inside Stellaris. We didn't win giant money but we had fun! It wasn't too smokey and it is nice to have staff offer you a beverage complimentary!
g147249,d1526157,March 4 2016,After dinner and some music the casino was a great place to stop before heading to our room. A little luck - payout were good.
g147249,d1526157,March 3 2016,Close to hotels and open 24/7. Big casino with a lot of games to play. I would recommend. One side note - there is a smoke smell because smoking is permitted in this casino.
g147249,d1526157,March 3 2016,We enjoy going to this casino because it is pretty large so smoke is not that bad. Also there were seats available at table games so that is a plus....some casinos too packed!
g147249,d1526157,March 1 2016,No one in the casino was friendly not even at VIP club. Table personnel not talkative at all. Enough said
g147249,d1526157,February 29 2016,A typical casino with a great bar and restaurant at the entrance. If you get a chance hit the comedy club. A great value and our five comedians who performed were quite good.
g147249,d1526157,February 27 2016,NIce quaint casino staff extremely friendly. Always have a little luck here met friends for a night of gambling and drinks!
g147249,d1526157,February 26 2016,The Stellaris casino is a first rate establishment not like some of the casinos that are peppered across the US. It is inside the Marriott and is a safe lovely place to enjoy a night of gambling. Smoking throughout the establishment is still allowed there but if you aren't bothered by cigarette smoke you will enjoy the casino.
g147249,d1526157,February 26 2016,
g147249,d207994,February 26 2016,
g147249,d207994,February 26 2016,The Debbie II is a great dive. Deep and well situated for exploration. Expect to see barracuda large rays morays and fireworms (DO NOT TOUCH! if you don't like pain!) This dive is best if in a small group and is a good spot for photography opportunities.
g147249,d207994,February 26 2016,This wreck sits in 70 feet of water on a nice reef there have been some sea horses at this site which is rare and exciting
g147249,d207994,February 26 2016,
g147249,d207994,February 26 2016,This is one of my favorite dive sites on the island. The ship is largely intact and it has a good amount of sea life around it. It is worth going to.
g147249,d207994,February 26 2016,This is a wreck dive site of moderate difficulty. Not really recommended for anyone without wreck dive training or experience. But nice.
g147249,d207994,February 26 2016,Debbie II is an interesting wreck dive site but it is not really accessible otherwise. The wreck attracts shoaling fish including barracuda. The dive is suitable for all levels of divers.
g147249,d207994,February 26 2016,Easy dive lots of fish. Dove with Native Divers --Romeo is a blast but reach him on his cell he nver answers emails.
g147249,d207994,February 26 2016,Not in challenging waters and easily accessible for boat dives. Lots of underwater sea-life on and near the wreck

g147249,d539183,March 10 2016,
g147249,d539183,March 10 2016,This is a very active beach and while there are many people it's a really fun place to visit/stay. I love the beautiful white sand and convenience of all the restaurants and bars along the beach.
g147249,d539183,March 10 2016,This is another beautiful beach in Aruba. Looks just like the pictures; no illusions. Just a great place to swim or walk and good for family or adults. We will go back to Aruba!!
g147249,d539183,March 10 2016,Eagle Beach is probably the most beautiful beach I have seen in the Caribbean  Divi Trees while walking on this long and wide stretch of clean beach. A must stop and spend the day kind of trip.
g147249,d539183,March 10 2016,Well this is the action beach. High rise hotels long strip of beach bars and restaurants. Lots of water activities and people watching. The sand is not aso soft a powder as some of the others but very nice none the less. The kite boarding is popular there. The water is calm.
g147249,d539183,March 10 2016,
g147249,d539183,March 9 2016,
g147249,d539183,March 8 2016,best beach in Aruba. No need to visit any other beaches because you will be disappointed in comparison to palm beach.
g147249,d539183,March 8 2016,Wow this was an awesome beach. Weather is 85 and breezy everyday in Aruba. No seasons and very little rain. Lots of places on beach and piers to rent stuff and reserve excursions like diving snorkle trips sunset sails.
g147249,d539183,March 8 2016,Top 3 beaches we have visited in the world!! Calm waters beautiful cilors soft white sand and lots of food options....great people watching too!
g147249,d539183,March 7 2016,Perfect beach for relaxing in the water. No waves! Just clear warm water. There's not much area of sand to get to the water. Perfect for those hot days when the sand is too hot!
g147249,d539183,March 6 2016,
g147249,d539183,March 6 2016,What a fantastic beach soft white sand and a warm blue ocean to swim in. A cool breeze that keeps the majority of insects away is welcome.
g147249,d539183,March 6 2016,Not much else to say besides white sand and blue waters. There's a lot of water sports/activities along Palm Beach which is probably the one thing preventing the water from being crystal clear. Other than that there are bars and restaurants all along so you can satisfy your beach vacation needs all on one beach.
g147249,d539183,March 4 2016,Yes it too is a beautiful beach in Aruba. ..better for older people and families with younger children. .water not as deep and calmer. Due to it being up near the high risers it is busier...it has the same beautiful blue water and white sand! Love Aruba beaches! !!
g147249,d539183,March 3 2016,hotel was right on palm beach86 every day the whitest sand and ocean is like bath water what else can you say about Aruba? if you have been then go
g147249,d539183,March 3 2016,Palm beach is a beautiful beach a little busy with watersports and activities but they are also entertaining to watch during the afternoon. Very relaxing atmosphere very few locals on the beach. Very safe to bring your family to! I would definitely recommend staying on this beach.
g147249,d539183,March 3 2016,
g147249,d539183,March 2 2016,
g147249,d539183,March 2 2016,
g147249,d539183,March 2 2016,The resort we were at is on Palm Beach and the sand is wonderful and the views at the beach as just as wonderful.
g147249,d539183,March 1 2016,Beautiful beach with calm water great for swimming and beautiful sunsets. No need to visit other beaches in Aruba. We stayed at Riu Palace Antillas. We had direct access to the beach.
g147249,d539183,February 29 2016,
g147249,d539183,February 29 2016,Stunning blue/green water and powdery sand! Sure it is busy with all the high rise hotels but it really is hard to find fault with this beach.
g147249,d539183,February 29 2016,
g147249,d539183,February 28 2016,This beach is so fun. Plenty of laying out area activities not loud or rowdy very clean white sand no rocks or coral and it's very shallow. We took plenty of naps on the beach. Not to noisy. Plenty of restrooms restaurants and bars on the beach. Lots of fun
g147249,d539183,February 28 2016,
g147249,d539183,February 27 2016,The hotels simply crowd the beach. Sand is clean. Water often has a lot of seaweed. I have had to endure men sitting next to smoking Cuban cigars. Terrible.
g147249,d539183,February 27 2016,A beautiful tranquil beach with deep blue water. Perfect for a walk or a run on the beach. Safe and tourist friendly.
g147249,d539183,February 27 2016,Just imagine crystal white beaches and water so clear you can see your toes in 4ft. of water. There's always a breeze on the beach which will keep you comfortablea great place to relax.
g147249,d539183,February 27 2016,
g147249,d539183,February 26 2016,Palm beach is our favorite beach. Its clear blue water calm and never have seen any seeweed. Aways clean very serene.
g147249,d539183,February 26 2016,Palm beach is gorgeous. It was not overcrowded so there was plenty of room for everyone to be comfortable without being too close. The beach is very clean and the hotel staff from the Hilton rake their section of the beach every morning so it's nice and clean.
g147249,d539183,February 25 2016,
g147249,d539183,February 25 2016,This beach has a lot of activities from renting paddle boards canoes bars food and other stuff. The water is very calm and shallow. The water is very family friendly. But not my favorite which is Arashi
g147249,d539183,February 25 2016,
g147249,d539183,February 24 2016,I thought 7 mile beach changed my life until I visited Palm Beach! Pristine and very clean! Wind surfing water sports scuba snorkeling sunset sails! Countless bars and restaurants! I'll be back!
g147249,d539183,February 23 2016,The beach is awesome with crystal clear water and soft fluffy sand. No life guards like the states. There are water sports just down the beach. Grab a 5.00 chair and you are set. If you are staying for the week the local Hardware had chairs for 25.00.
g147249,d539183,February 23 2016,All beaches are public and can be used by all. I went everyday and I have nothing but good times. My hotel had a shuttle until 5pm but it was a short walk less than 5 minutes walking casually. Nice breeze everyday. You have to walk to the pier of a hotel for bathroom usage.
g147249,d539183,February 23 2016,Great beach with a few miles of soft white sand to walk you great food off stroll during sunset and walk home after a night out.
g147249,d539183,February 23 2016,
g147249,d539183,February 23 2016,Wanted a place a little private away from the masses. This is the perfect beach. Took my cooler of local beer with me another beverage for the lady and off we went. Very nice white sandy beach. Great place to relax and be alone.(almost)
g147249,d539183,February 23 2016,The beaches are just so beautiful and to walk along them for miles and miles. Everyone is so friendly and the water is that amazing color.
g147249,d539183,February 22 2016,

g147249,d539183,February 22 2016,
g147249,d539183,February 22 2016,We walked Palm beach everyday...where all the resort are... There is also a nice boardwalk on this beach. You shop eat ..very nice!!
g147249,d539183,February 21 2016,
g147249,d539183,February 21 2016,Perfect view of the sunset every night. Expect a crowd though. We were on the Riu beach. Cannot recommend the hotel much but the beach was very nice.
g147249,d539183,February 21 2016,Stayed at the Riu Palace. Food was fantastic the people(staff) were superb. Loved it. They now have a salt water pool. It's all renovated.
g147249,d539183,February 21 2016,Always love the beach!!! Who cannot love the beautiful sandy and lovely water.....view is always great!!
g147249,d539183,February 20 2016,The beach was kept clean and organized. Keep careful watch of children though. There is a fairly steep incline just a few feet into the water.
g147249,d539183,February 20 2016,Beautiful large beach that has plenty of room to spread out without over crowding. The water is crystal blue.
g147249,d539183,February 19 2016,Nice calm water to swim. Beautiful beach scene with jet skis paddle boarding etc. some stretches are more crowded than others. Can be a challenge to find shade.
g147249,d539183,February 18 2016,Beautiful Beach sand so clean. Loved the ocean swimming and floating on raft .Loved walking the beach.

g147249,d539183,February 18 2016,Great beach for people watching and water sports. And close to some local shopping and restaurants and hotels. Perfect for those looking for activities on the beach.
g147249,d539183,February 17 2016,This is one of the best beaches we have been to. Very beautiful sand shells and surf. Not to be missed.
g147249,d539183,February 17 2016,A great beautiful beach with many good high rise chain hotels Holiday Inn Marriott Hyatt Regency Hilton etc. The ocean is calm and very nice to swim with families. The sand is like powder and not hot on your feet because it is crushed coral.
g147249,d539183,February 17 2016,Great restaurants Madame Janette's a must. Favo go for sunset food just good. Gianni's Italian great food.
g147249,d539183,February 17 2016,Beautiful weather fun in the sun. I would definitely come back. Great for families. Water is perfect.
g147249,d539183,February 16 2016,Palm Beach is beautiful. It is the best location with perfect sand and beautiful turquoise water. It is busier than Eagle Beach but definitely the place to be.
g147249,d539183,February 16 2016,The "happening" beach in the high rise district has a wide beach great sand loungers and blue water. Its the busier side compared to Eagle Beach...but its a great spot to people watch and to enjoy a relaxing day.
g147249,d539183,February 16 2016,Walked all the way from Palm Beach to Eagle Beach today my choice would be Palm Beach several places to hang out right at the waters edge. Great sugar sand. Clean. Not too crowded although I think Eagle Beach had even less people. Can't wait to come again
g147249,d539183,February 15 2016,been hear twice once in the last week of January and now we went in the first week of January and I was in the adults section at the riu antillas (adults only) I loved it

g147249,d576607,March 7 2016,Nice place to play texas holdem during holidays for small and medium bankroll. Many tourists and some locals.
g147249,d576607,February 11 2016,Cannot get a line on football until day of game. Line comes out on Sunday but you cannot bet that number until the next Sunday. Poor sports book at best.
g147249,d576607,February 6 2016,Couldn't stand the cigarette smoke couldn't stay and spend money......sorry. Very disappointing as a few evenings before we'd enjoyed a wonderful evening at the Alahamba.
g147249,d576607,February 6 2016,This was a blast I'm not a gambler so there was no big sell here just a welcomegood people good food and and it was walking distance from my hotelperfect.
g147249,d576607,February 6 2016,We are staying at this resort for first time and it's good to have a medium size casino inside hotel but the smoke bothers me. Maybe they could up grade on a better ventilation system for those who don't want ta smoke but want to support the business. The staff was friendly and casino is clean.

g147249,d6017633,March 7 2016,not enough game tables and lost every night. The casino is smoky inside which I did not like. They do bring you free drinks though.
g147249,d6017633,March 4 2016,Very small and too many penny slots. Needs more dollar barrel slots not video slots. The machines are tight.
g147249,d6017633,March 1 2016,
g147249,d6017633,February 29 2016,
g147249,d6017633,February 28 2016,Loved playing at this casino. Bright and very comfortable casiono. Table game chairs are comfortable drink come in a real glass. Space to walk about and people watch or watch your group winning. I would mark this as one of my favorites.
g147249,d6017633,February 24 2016,Although the actual resort is quite lovely the casino was underwhelming. Just average service and not elegant at all.

g147249,d6017633,February 17 2016,This is by far the best casino on the island. The dealers are friendly and we love that they remember us year-to-year. Big shout-out to Melissa Sandra and Larry. They're all wonderful and make the experience enjoyable with their great personalities.

g147249,d6376262,March 7 2016,
g147249,d6376262,March 6 2016,The staff and resort are 5 Star. The recent and continued renovations are beautiful. The guests and staff are like family. Amazing at how quickly bonds are created. The Islander Grill is definitely improving. We've been going since 2010 and this past trip we were pleasantly pleased with our meals. The resort is clean and very safe.
g147249,d6376262,March 4 2016,Right by the beach less kids and not over crowded. Food was good and the service was awesome. We had big fun in the casino and will definitely stay there on our return trip.
g147249,d6376262,March 3 2016,We have been coming here since 2005 and love it. The location is great with the best beach right in front of the resort. The staff are all very friendly and helpful. The rooms are perfect for our needs. Can't wait to come back.
g147249,d6376262,March 1 2016,It has been a few years since we have been back to Aruba but it is still great as ever. My daughter loved the pool and the food was great!
g147249,d6376262,February 27 2016,Stood at LaCabana for the last 5 years.Rooms updated 1 bedroom & studio are roomy. Beds comfortable rooms clean. Resturants on site are very good. Love the beach which is Eagle Beach. Friendly staff. Live entertainment. Excellent location. Grocery store directly behind. Half way point to High Rise and Downtown. Accessible by cab and bus.
g147249,d6376262,February 24 2016,1st time to Aruba. La Cabana is great. We expected no view since that was what they said and to our surprise we had a really decent view off our balcony. The beach is beautiful and clean. The sand is so soft. The employees are by sweet and happy all the time.

g147249,d6376262,February 20 2016,great place with all the amenities that you would need for a great beach hotel stay. good restaurants good bar scene and great beach.
g147249,d672110,February 29 2016,
g147249,d672110,February 29 2016,I stayed at this hotel and found the casino not only convenient but low key and not as frantic as the casino at the Hyatt.
g147249,d672110,February 25 2016,The staff in the casino is not very friendly. They are very serious about the gaming instead of trying to help people who have never played before and making it fun they are very serious
g147249,d672110,February 24 2016,What a nice break from site seeing and touring or beach sittling take a day and try out your luck at the casino was a lot of fun.
g147249,d672110,February 24 2016,Fine if you want to sit and play slots. Almost no action at the craps table all week. Small 5 oz beers served as drinks. Do not recommend.
g147249,d672110,February 18 2016,
g147249,d672110,February 17 2016,Smaller casino then I am used to coming from NJ. Dealers not really friendly and constantly changing (rotating places)
g147249,d672110,February 11 2016,tried to play craps and they only had 1/2 table open due only 1 dealer. Table boss was arguing with stickman and dealer. telling them how to place bets just rude. Not a place I would go again. Also no longer the Radisson. Now owned by Hilton
g147249,d672110,February 11 2016,We where here 3 nights during our stay at the neighbour Grand Occidental. We found the place "not so nice" and it was difficult to have any nice contact with dealers. Okay service wityh drinks maybe the fastest on Aruba?
g147249,d672110,February 11 2016,Way to many young kids stealing all the tables. Playing all night at the tables and not allowing anyone else to play. Lousy music
g147249,d672110,February 11 2016,Dingy and smelly. A slot machine parlor with a few table games. Drinks in plastic cups makes the experience less than pleasant.

g147251,d147447,March 9 2016,
g147251,d147447,March 9 2016,Beautiful beach. Worth the drive off the beaten path. Two good restaurant stops. Bring drinks. I saw some people snorkeling. Not sure how many fish were out there. Shallow waters. Good for families.
g147251,d147447,March 9 2016,
g147251,d147447,March 8 2016,Another beautiful beach in Aruba But again to calm for my style Excellent at sunset. Kind Regards Friscoboy
g147251,d147447,March 8 2016,
g147251,d147447,March 8 2016,
g147251,d147447,March 7 2016,On the opposite end of the island from Eagle/Palm beaches is Baby Beach. We got here by bus! The bus driver shared local history about that area of the island. San Nicolas was at one time home of the refinery workers until the refinery closed and beach opened to the public. Limited facilities but nice family atmosphere.
g147251,d147447,March 6 2016,You can easily spend a whole day here. This was our stop for snorkeling but because of the rough water even the strongest swimmers were having trouble. Be prepared to pay for everything including the bathroom. The water and sandy bottom were very nice.

g147263,d147728,March 7 2016,
g147263,d147728,March 7 2016,Sugary white sand and clear water. What else do you need. Spent half day as a part of cruise ship activity. Very relaxing. As a part of the tour got a delicious flying fish sandwich at Harbour Lights.
g147263,d147728,March 6 2016,Highly recommended for a relaxing day. The water is warm and clear. You can swim with the turtles so bring your snorkel gear. You can lunch at Cuz's or the Hilton or Radison which are on the beach. The beach is quite long and great to walk.
g147263,d147728,March 6 2016,This is a nice beach with sumbed and brolly concessions operating. Toilet facilities we sed were part of a paid deal.
g147263,d147728,March 6 2016,
g147263,d147728,March 3 2016,Stroll the beach snorkel with the turtles  paddle board or paddle surf"... This beach and bay is a must see for at least a few hours or days on your trip to Barbados.
g147263,d147728,March 3 2016,Excursion provided by Celebrity Cruises. Beautiful beach water was clear. One of the snorkelers found a star fish! He returned it to the sea after showing it to us! Food was good and the vendors weren't bothersome.
g147264,d149093,March 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,March 9 2016,This is a beautiful beach nestled between limestone cliffs. This is an awesome place to even just stop by and see!.
g147264,d149093,March 2 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 29 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 24 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 23 2016,This beach is very busy. It has blue umbrellas and chairs a few artisans selling crafts calm waters (at least calm by this part of the island standards) and public facilities close by. It does have a good bit of seaweed but hey it is the ocean. :)
g147264,d149093,February 22 2016,Absolutely beautiful. Soft white sand and turquoise water. The sea is very rough though which is a great shame as it is very warm and inviting. only recommended for very strong swimmers and even then enter the sea with caution. Very comfortable sun loungers on the beach made it an idyllic place to relax and enjoy the sun and scenery.
g147264,d149093,February 21 2016,Loved this beach with its big waves and the cliff jumping. I personally didn't cliff jump since I was too scared (about a 5m jump) and the current was rough! Only downside is that there is seaweed and the waves are too intense to simply hang around in the water.
g147264,d149093,February 18 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 15 2016,Visited for much of one day while awaiting a flight home from Barbados. Made very welcome and offered a wide range of facilities including restaurants for lunch etc. Seemed a good place to stay although rather large and impersonal to our personal tastes.
g147264,d149093,February 12 2016,Crane Beach is still one of the most beautiful in the world - and they have made progress in controlling the pervasive seaweed problem with the addition of new tethered booms offshore. Would still like to see more raking on he beach to keep the beautiful sand clear and walkable.
g147264,d149093,February 11 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 11 2016,One or two of the many vendors are a tad pushy but just ignore them and they will leave you alone. Aside from that is a picturesque and gorgeous little beach to spend the day.
g147264,d149093,February 10 2016,By far the best Beach hands down! Fabulous white sand so clean and lots of surf!! Actually totally breathtaking!!
g147264,d149093,February 10 2016,This is a relatively small beach and not too busy. Gorgeous breakers and turquoise ocean. We had coconut cocktails on the beach and managed to haggle an excellent price. We will be back.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 5 2016,Back again to the Crane beach. The resort has solved the seaweed problem from last year. The beach is stunning. We spent a couple of hours hanging in the continuous waves that are refreshing and an experience. it does not get any better than this. Best beach experience at the Crane beach in my 4 years to the island.

g147264,d149093,February 5 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 5 2016,Lovely popular beach too many people for me prefer the more secluded beaches in Barbados. All in all a lovely beach with friendly locals selling drinks.
g147264,d149093,February 5 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 5 2016,Don't leave Barbados without experiencing this....it has been voted one of the top ten beaches in the world...and from the restaurant on the top sipping a chilled glass of rosé eating lobster salad it certainly lives up to its name. Body surfing the waves with everyone from aged 8 to 75 is simply the best
g147264,d149093,February 5 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 5 2016,Beautiful beach with white sand and big waves coming from the sea. Visited only for a while but will surely get back when visiting Barbados next time.
g147264,d149093,February 5 2016,Gorgeous beach. Accessible from a steep muddy road or through the grounds of the Crane Resort. The gatekeeper at the resort appeared not to want to let us in but we sucked up big time. The beach can then be accessed by elevator which is adjacent to the L'Azure restaurant. Beautiful pinkish sand but big waves and reputable strong undercurrents
g147264,d149093,February 5 2016,Absolutely wonderful! This beach was the best beach I've seen except for Bora Bora. I recommend this place highly!
g147264,d149093,February 5 2016,This beach is absolutely beautiful! The remarkably pure white sand several different shades of blue and rocky features make it a great spot to admire the beauty of nature. Great for pictures!! Not only that the waves were really fun to play in. They were huge! Just be careful if you have small children
g147264,d149093,February 5 2016,Expensive sun loungers and pushy drinks sellers made this a beach we won't return to. Try bottom bay if you're willing not to swim (undercurrents) or Miami beach
g147264,d149093,February 5 2016,This beach has strong undertows making it less safe for small children to enjoy. Also getting to the beach is hard. It's a very long way down from The Crane hotel and the elevator didn't work for us. If you drive via the public access there is very limited (no parking) on the cliff road. More hassle than it's worth.
g147264,d149093,February 5 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 5 2016,The view was as beautiful as I pictured. Though the water was a bit rough it was quite inviting especially when I ventured to the rock on the eastern side. Great cliff diving spot.
g147264,d149093,February 5 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 5 2016,Fun waves wonderful silky sands. Friendly beach bar tucked away in the dunes. BUT overpowered by hotel that appeared to have suffered lots of extensions. Approach over concrete stepping stones that waves were making wet and slippery not the easiest. Parking facilities poor. Have been recommended to continue a little further South to Foul Bay.
g147264,d149093,February 5 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 5 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 5 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 5 2016,Whilst just past the full force of the atlantic coast the waves at Crane beach are still active enough for some fun boogie boarding. With an interesting hop across some stepping stones across the rocks this beach is not disabled friendly but hey there are plenty of others. Beach side amenities are adequate and there are beachside sellers of refreshments.
g147264,d149093,February 5 2016,they tried hard to get rid of the seagras but had to deposit it at the beach (smell). they provide normally an elevator which was out of order but never mind the fiew staires.
g147264,d149093,February 5 2016,One of the best beaches on the islandwith a bar and grill within easy reach for lunchthe surf here can be a bit strong but it's certainly fun for all you wake boarders.

g147264,d149093,February 5 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 5 2016,Amazing beach great little bar and great coconut drinks. The water is very ruff...so if u like waves this is the place to be....and make sure you take a stroll up and down the cliff wonderful views
g147264,d149093,February 5 2016,We stopped in for a bite and a swim but were surprised by the amount of sargassum sea weed on the beach. Between the smells and the fact that it was in the water the swim was called off. Crane staff was working to clear it and I hope it is gone before long
g147264,d149093,February 5 2016,This is a beautiful beach tucked under the Crane Resort. Being on the East (Atlantic) coast the waves are strong and plentiful providing lots of fun while in the water. The first one hit me like an uppercut to the jaw. The last one which I tried to ride in threw me to the bottom. It was awesome!
g147264,d149093,February 5 2016,Even if you aren't a guest of the Crane Resort you can get public access to this beach and I suggest you not miss it. There is a little tiki bar there and it has the best Maui Maui I've ever had. Also the locals make you rum drinks in real coconuts.
g147264,d149093,February 5 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 5 2016,You have to be careful when swimming but its worth it. beautiful white sand and very natural. Has a good beach bar and grill and other facilities.
g147264,d149093,February 5 2016,An absolutely beautiful east coast beach however  not a safe place to swim. Access if with many stairs down to beach and once there not a lot of amenities. Finally the east coast is very rugged and not over populated . If you stay in that area  it's a long way to anywhere. Not for us.
g147264,d149093,February 5 2016,Never stayed here but visited the beautiful clean beach. Great swimming snorkelling or just relaxing
g147264,d149093,February 5 2016,Stunning beach - fantastic colours - worth a stop just to take a look and feel the soft sand between toes. Appart from one fisherman (fishing from the beach) we were the only ones on the beach that morning - very beautiful and worth a photo stop
g147264,d149093,February 5 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 5 2016,What a great day spent at an awesome beach. Water is very ruff high and strong waves. Be aware that there are some guys that try to sell you coco water and other stuff. A bit annoying. but the views WOW!!
g147264,d149093,February 5 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 5 2016,Wonderful pink sand beach considered one of the best of the world by USA Today readers. Very suitable for couples looking for a romantic spot.

g147264,d149093,February 5 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 5 2016,What a beautiful beach but very hard to find it looks like you are driving down someone's driveway you can get food and drink.
g147264,d149093,February 5 2016,Not as amazing as the reviews. Even despite the seaweed. Don't get the hype. May not return since the other beaches are just as good if not better.
g147264,d149093,February 5 2016,The beach is stunning and feels so secluded. There's a small cliff that is safe and easy to jump off of. However the beach is basically run by vendors. If you don't want to be bothered by them stay closer to the far right side of the beach. Overall definitely a must-see when in Barbados!
g147264,d149093,February 5 2016,We were just here in June and the seaweed was under control. We stayed at the resort but went to investigate the public access. If you are not staying at the resort: the public access could be treacherous. The beach is worth it!

g147264,d149095,March 8 2016,Visited whilst on a short tour of the island. A beautiful building and graveyard with plenty of history well worth making the effort to get there if you enjoy old churches and history. The position on the cliff top is stunning and the views over the sea and countryside are beautiful.
g147264,d149095,February 14 2016,
g147264,d149095,February 11 2016,A friend recommended we visit and we were glad we did. Interesting old church fascinating graveyard and exquisite views of the island and coast.
g147264,d149095,February 11 2016,This very old church exudes history. Located on a cliff top overlooking the Atlantic the views are beautiful. There are many unusual features including some of the graves around the church. A most tranquil place.
g147264,d149095,February 11 2016,A very beautiful church with a lot of history and splendid views across the coastline. This was a surprise as you don't expect anything going back as far as this. Well worth the visit.
g147264,d149095,February 11 2016,This church is so historic and some of the plaques can be dated back to the 1600s. There is an amazing view of the east coast. The church still functions for the community so you can't always go inside if there is a private function happening. Well worth the trip to the east coast

g147290,d627325,March 8 2016,
g147290,d627325,March 8 2016,Don't let the falls fool you. This is not a take pictures of the falls and leave you actually climb them and then slide down to get back. Staff great and very helpful for those who are not strong swimmers.
g147290,d627325,March 7 2016,
g147290,d627325,March 7 2016,I visited them many times as I live here and many times friends ask me to take them there I did both the 8 waterfall trip and the 12 waterfall personally I prefer the 8 as you go up inside the waterfall and you enjoy so much the water and the colors of the place

My legs were like jelly by the time we reached the top but I was competing with youngsters forty years younger. Our guides were attentive and when I lost my glasses in one of the deeper pools they dived until they found them.

g147293,d215733,March 10 2016,This is the most amazing white sand beach I've ever seen. It goes on for miles and is all the purest white sand you can imagine. The water colours look like post cards and every photo could be it own post card.
g147293,d215733,March 10 2016,Food average device good drinks weak but all you have to do is ask for a shot on the side and you can fix it as you like. Awesome resort and a wonderful time. Will be coming back for sure.
g147293,d215733,March 9 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 9 2016,Bavaro Beach is beautiful and is perfect if you enjoy walking on long white sandy stretches of beach. It does get very busy as it is an extremely popular area to visit and many large resorts are situated here.

g147293,d215733,March 10 2016,Had lunch and sat on the beach. Very quiet and relaxing before the fun began and the boat picked us up.
g147293,d215733,March 10 2016,This is the most amazing white sand beach I've ever seen. It goes on for miles and is all the purest white sand you can imagine. The water colours look like post cards and every photo could be it own post card.
g147293,d215733,March 10 2016,Food average device good drinks weak but all you have to do is ask for a shot on the side and you can fix it as you like. Awesome resort and a wonderful time. Will be coming back for sure.
g147293,d215733,March 9 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 9 2016,Bavaro Beach is beautiful and is perfect if you enjoy walking on long white sandy stretches of beach. It does get very busy as it is an extremely popular area to visit and many large resorts are situated here.
g147293,d215733,March 9 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 9 2016,Beach is fantastic....water temp around 82 degrees....great for snorkeling or scuba diving. We wore shorties Scuba Diving but it was hardly necessary.
g147293,d215733,March 9 2016,the beach is paradise....somewhat crowded but overall I had a wonderful experience...the only think I would recommend is to get there early
g147293,d215733,March 9 2016,This is one of the softest sand beaches I have ever walked on. Absolutely beautiful with plenty of chairs to lounge on.
g147293,d215733,March 9 2016,Magnificent water white sand stay at a good resort like paradisus so worth the money the service food gym brand drinks fresh fruit and gorgeous rooms
g147293,d215733,March 9 2016,Wonderful location good food Lots of different restaurants to choose from. Rivera buffet also very good. staff friendly helpful and fun. Best holiday ever ! !4 friends and family for a 6oth birthday.
g147293,d215733,March 9 2016,No joke. We walked as much as we could and there didn't seem to be an end to the white sand. Lots of resorts on the water but never feels crowded.
g147293,d215733,March 8 2016,While staying at the The Reserve at Paradisus Palma Real we visited this part of the resort for swimming paddle boarding para sailing and kayaking.
g147293,d215733,March 8 2016,Walked that beach every day during my week and I have to say it was always a pleasure. The only possible downside would be the intrusion from the vendors but it could also be fun.
g147293,d215733,March 8 2016,Excellent winter destination and superb customer service. Can't say enough good things; just don't plan to lose weight in this place.
g147293,d215733,March 8 2016,The beach is beautifull by the Bavaro Princess hotel soft white sand that's not hot at all. The water is beautiful too clear and turqoise but with large waves and strong current so watch out for yout little ones. Water was nice and warm
g147293,d215733,March 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 8 2016,I can't wait to go back this April 2016. Juan Carlos and the entire staff was amazing. Me Mom and 3 Sister's had the best vacation ever. I talked my husband to take me there for my April birthday. We're booked and ready to go....I'm so excited
g147293,d215733,March 8 2016,Very nice beach with nice palm trees soft sand not too many weeds but many vendors wanting you to buy hats cigars craft etc...
g147293,d215733,March 8 2016,Beautiful - paradise on earth highly recommend a visit Sand was like icing sugar it was so soft. Crystal clear water - heaven
g147293,d215733,March 8 2016,Typical carribean beach white sand and clear blue water. Beach is mostly claimed by resorts. Not really suitable for snorkling though.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,We stopped at this beach on our day excursion it was beautiful and the bathrooms were very nice! They had kite surfing right next to the beach if we had more time I would have loved to do that!
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,The different shades of blue are amazing. There are sections with a lot of seaweed but the workers clean it up daily. There are plenty of spots to relax in the water without being touched by seaweed. Overall fairly calm waters only slight waves when boats pass by.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Stayed here briefly with friends and has stunning beach and clear waters. Paradise personified. Loved it.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Spend some quality time with the family and enjoy the nice clean sand and water. Beatiful place to take some pictures and relax with the wonderful weather we experience.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,All you ever wanted in a beach! Fine sand clear waters few seaweed clean perfect for long romantic walks or lounging. Also we saw few of the pesky vendors that are so common on other beaches. Enjoy!
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,White sands and blue clean water a gorgeous beach. Water was very tranquil and warm. What I would give to be back there today!! Watching the sun setting and the palm trees makes a perfect picture.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,We visited here briefly towards the end of our excursion. It was beautiful!! The sand was white and the water was the perfect temperature. It was quite quiet on the beach which was nice as it felt we had it to ourselves. Good place to visit if you're out and about!
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Soft white sand . . . beautiful clear and calm blue water . . . not crowded. No jewelry or shirt salesmen to disturb the tranquil setting. Would highly recommend!
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,Amazing food managing wine service come with no worry. Great experience somilier great food. Service good great resort.
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,Bavaro Beach is absolutely beautiful. Sand is amazing water not too hot not too cold and where we stayed (Barcelo Bavaro Princess Deluxe) it is surrounded by a coral reef so super calm and perfect for young children.
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,Shallow waters clean sands and beautiful palm trees. You can walk down the beach for miles to see the different resorts.
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,Beach is beautiful! Water was warm with no weeds. Clear and sand. You can walk forever in both directions. Large not crowded.
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,Just gorgeous with no litter very well manicured. We walked up and down the beach along the waters edge and saw other resorts watched them play games and watched the water sports.
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,The beach has very fine sand and the ocean is easy walk. Seaweed does generally wash up along the beach but it's easy to walk over what's usually a small strip.
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,Gorgeous picturesque beach with many activities available for rent. Riu portion of the beach even had small chunks of old coral reef within the swimming area that provided some neat underwater viewing. Side note: do not reach under those reef chunks; even if you think you see a seashell...it's really an eel with very sharp teeth.
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,Very nice beaches in this area comparable to Montego Bay Jamaica and Aruba. Would return again in the future.
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,Beautiful beaches. Turquoise waters. Some seaweed but it is the ocean after all. Windy the week were there so waters not real clear.
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,This was our third time to Punta Cana and I must say that the beach is gorgeous...the staff at the resorts in my humble opinion do a pretty good job at clearing the seaweed and you can walk for miles along this lovely stretch of white sand.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Powder sand beach for miles  clean beautiful pictiurous beach easy to walkor even run manyactivity spots for parasailing banana boating water sports
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,The beach walk is powder soft sand and the peek into some of the residences and resort properties are all so different and tropical. Some are restoring from hurricane damage. Be careful by the beach front shops as the beach when the tide is in is mostly water. Visit them thiugh they are nice barter.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Warm white sands and light turquoise waters just a beautiful beach. Sometimes there would be excessive seaweed but would be quickly removed by the staff. This is a beach to go to just relax and then get in the water and repeat as much s possible.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,lots of seaweed coming in from ocean. But its really nice to walk by the beach and away from all hotels.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,This is a fantastic place to take your holidaythe weather is awesomethe people are amazingthe beach and the water is fantasticwe are having a great time. I would strongly recommend that you visit this excellent place. Salut 😎👊
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Was really nice blue water and sand palm trees plenty viewing for people watching. The weather was perfect alot of locals selling on beach kinda only drawback
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,I took a walk every day on the beach. It was well maintain with men raking seaweed to make sure it as a nice beach. Sand is fine and easy to walk on.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,A truly beautiful beach with great sand. It is a large beach and beautiful palm trees. No peddlers ever bothered us.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,We can't wait to return this year!! The beach was so beautiful - crystal clear and no waves! Morning and evening walks were so serene!
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Beautiful beach. Clear water lots of activities and great people watching. Only downside is most of beach is all-inclusive resort owned the few public areas were not the cleanest or nicest spots to sit or grab a drink.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Third time back to Bavaro. I have to say that my wife and I do a ton of walking on the beach and the Melia resort by far has the best beach front on Bravaro! Love the whole beach tho. Great turquoise water and lots of activities to see and do.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Not sure if i was simply lucky but this was truly the BEST beach I have ever seen (I have not travelled to Turks yet). Crystal clear turquoise water wide strip white sand virtually no seaweed. Simply amazing! Although those who have been to Turks and Caicos say that Bavaro is number 2.

g147293,d2176484,March 10 2016,
g147293,d2176484,March 9 2016,Honestly one of the most beautiful places I have EVER seen in my entire life. The scenery the water the enormous waves the seclusion. It's all amazing and a definite must see!
g147293,d2176484,March 9 2016,It's a bit of a drive to Macao Beach which makes it perfect. Keeps the "hoards" of tourists away. :-) And there's even a licensed restaurant with GREAT fish! A quiet place where you can actually fall asleep in the sunshine.
g147293,d2176484,March 9 2016,What a beautiful white sand beach. Water and waves were Awesome!! Getting out and boogie boarding and body surfing is always a blast. Some surfers were out catching waves as well. Very nice beach.
g147293,d2176484,March 8 2016,
g147293,d2176484,March 7 2016,
g147293,d2176484,March 7 2016,Macao beach was one of our stops on a muddy ATV excursion. Nice beach & views. Beach vendors on site. No facilities of any sort that i could see.
g147293,d2176484,March 6 2016,This was included in our safari tour and we had about 45 minutes to visit. It was already included and not too crowded.
g147293,d2176484,March 6 2016,Had two days of beginner surfing lessons! Great instructors fine waves. Breathtaking beach. What else can be said? A local merchants. Absolutely non intrusive. Also a sober sort for ATVs and scooter excursions
g147293,d2176484,March 5 2016,
g147293,d253046,March 8 2016,
g147293,d253046,March 8 2016,The shows were alright. Some of them quite cheesy but at least they were still entertaining and fun. Be warned you will be harassed by sales people until you buy something Really set the whole trip off.
g147293,d253046,March 7 2016,Ridiculous! They don't take no for an answer! You have to pay for water since you can't bring your own! Get ready to be HARRASED HARRASED HARRASED!!!
g147293,d253046,March 6 2016,
g147293,d253046,February 27 2016,
g147293,d253046,February 25 2016,The experience we've gotten was very unique and positive. Swimming with the dolphins was amazing all the little shows were cute. However everything really NEEDS to be renovated.
g147293,d253046,February 21 2016,We enjoyed this little excursion. Don't go expecting Seaward or Disney but as a small park it wasn't bad and had some neat interactions like the bird cage where birds land all over you and eat from your hands.
g147293,d253046,February 19 2016,
g147293,d253046,February 11 2016,It is far below my expectations for the money we payed!!! It costed us 180$ on top the entrance fee which was 200 $ for me and my daughter. Far too commercial than expected.
g147293,d253046,February 9 2016,
g147293,d253046,February 9 2016,I went there and liked the shows given but the place is not in the greatest conditions there is a lot more places way better in Punta Cana.
g147293,d2615524,March 10 2016,
g147293,d2615524,March 10 2016,

g147293,d2615524,March 6 2016,
g147293,d2615524,March 6 2016,Very neat ending to a short interpretive hike; water was nice & cool & so clear you could see 100+ feet down into the cenote. Probably not enough to do as a single excursion but great to pair with one of the other activities at Cap Cana. We did it with the Iguabonita cave tour which was awesome.
g147293,d2615524,March 5 2016,
g147293,d2615524,March 4 2016,It is a ten minute walk to a natural pool a short swim in the pool and a ten minute walk back. Nothing special at all.
g147293,d2615524,March 3 2016,After a short 1/2 mile shaded hike you arrive at this beautiful blue pool and it will actually make you 5 years younger just like the guide says.
g147293,d2615524,March 3 2016,
g147293,d2615524,March 2 2016,definitely something to do while in punta cana. the water is so refreshing the water is completely clear. its an unforgettable experience

g147293,d320656,March 7 2016,
g147293,d320656,March 7 2016,
g147293,d320656,March 7 2016,So beautiful! I went on the Segway Tour and this was part of the tour. I loved it and would defiantly go back!!! So sad I had to leave. It's crystal clear a bit chilly but gorgeous!
g147293,d320656,March 1 2016,
g147293,d320656,March 1 2016,This excursion was peaceful but at the same time fun. We drove atvs up the mountain to get to here then walked for about 20 minutes to jump in the water. The water felt amazing !
g147293,d320656,February 29 2016,We've been talking about this since we got back! Awesome casino and if you can stay here it is outstanding!!!! WORTH THE VISIT!!!
g147293,d320656,February 25 2016,
g147293,d320656,February 24 2016,It's so relaxing and beautiful! Take your OFF with you or any repellent! The amazing blue crystalline water is so pleasant to the eye! I recommend this to anyone who wants to relax and have fun
g147293,d320656,February 22 2016,Great place to go with the kids and swim! Not a far walk to the swimming hole and the hole is worth it!
g147293,d320656,February 21 2016,

g147293,d3534434,March 10 2016,
g147293,d3534434,March 10 2016,We used AMstar to get to and from the airport. It was a private ride for us. The vehicles we new and in excellent condition. The driver was courteous. Everything went perfect.
g147293,d3534434,March 9 2016,Smooth and great service!! Met at the airport on time and was given and informative ride to the resort about Punta Cana and the Dominican Republic by our shuttle personal.
g147293,d3534434,March 8 2016,
g147293,d3534434,March 7 2016,Really a well run organization. Timely and very friendly staff. The Shuttle to and from the airport was very well run with a personable operator and VERY clean vehicles.
g147293,d3534434,March 6 2016,This group was set up through our travel package Apple but so glad we had them they were all great! Escpically Wilson!
g147293,d3534434,March 6 2016,we got great service from the Airport to the hotel. On the return trip to the airport we were the last stop and were squished in like a can of sardines
g147293,d3534434,March 4 2016,Suicidal driver tailgating the motors in front was very pleased to reach hotel safe + sound -- return driver so much more safe and assured
g147293,d3534434,March 2 2016,
g147293,d3534434,March 2 2016,They did a great job with transfers to and from the airport. Everything was timely and without a itch
g147293,d3570004,March 10 2016,
g147293,d3570004,March 10 2016,We booked several excursions as well as airport shuttle services with this company and were very pleased with them. They are friendly knowledgeable and accommodating.
g147293,d3570004,March 10 2016,Great airport transfer but don't book excurisions with them. Had a bad experience on a horse back riding. One my husband and I were on the trip with 3 guides. Went on back trails and very bad places.
g147293,d3570004,March 7 2016,
g147293,d3570004,March 6 2016,Olympus Tours had newer very clean vehicles. Friendly drivers and very informative about the island.
g147293,d3570004,March 2 2016,
g147293,d3570004,March 2 2016,Book with them  they show you a wonderful time !!! We booked the AVT for 2....and we had a BLAST !!!! We never saw so much mud and dirt.....then the beach to wash off.......very memorable time :-)
g147293,d3570004,February 29 2016,Stayed at the Melia Caribe Tropical. Olympus staff there were friendly patient and communicative. I had an issue after an excursion and they took care of it immediately. The drivers from and to the airport were on time friendly and went out of their way to make us comfortable. Terrific experience!

g147293,d3600549,February 27 2016,
g147293,d3600549,March 4 2016,Full of old farts throwing away their money. I am not interested by old farts nor by throwing away money.
g147293,d3600549,March 3 2016,The casino was very close to the hotel. Took the little shuttle in the evening for a half hour or so. Very clean. Name changed to Avalon Casino.
g147293,d3600549,February 27 2016,
g147293,d3600549,February 27 2016,The casino is located in easy walking distance from anywhere within the resort. Smoke free clean and fun!
g147293,d3600549,February 27 2016,Very friendly staff. We had a few hours of fun. We all lost money as expected. Only negative is the ride there from the resort in a modified golf cart late at night with a lot of scary people on the side of the road.
g147293,d3600549,February 27 2016,
g147293,d3600549,February 27 2016,We only visited for a couple of drinks and played slot. No to many options for gamblers. Good late night burger and fries.
g147293,d3600549,February 27 2016,This is not like any casino I've been to. It's tiny. There were a dozen or so slot machines a few table games and a bar. We played $40 on the slots it was something to do one evening while we were staying at the Bavaro Princess.
g147293,d3600549,February 27 2016,This casino is small by many standards. It was hit and miss on the slots and no action on the poker table. I suggest save your money and go somewhere else.
g147293,d3600549,February 27 2016,The casino is small but clean. Drink service was quick and friendly. Only stayed about 30 minutes and played the slot machines. It is worth a visit for a break from the resort.
g147293,d3609804,March 3 2016,
g147293,d3609804,March 6 2016,
g147293,d3609804,March 5 2016,Needs a lot of maintenance. The food is bad realy bad. Life guard are not doing their job just talking to each other. Bad security
g147293,d3609804,March 3 2016,
g147293,d3609804,March 2 2016,
g147293,d3609804,February 29 2016,This waterpark is the best in the area. Take the kids and spend most of a day there. Lunch provided too. It can keep the kids busy & cool while on the vacation. Especially good if your hotel is not quite up to kids activities.
g147293,d3609804,February 27 2016,We were a large group of 17 who spent the whole day at the waterpark and we truly had a fantastic time. From the youngest (2 years old) to the oldest (60) we had a great time going down the slides.
g147293,d3609804,February 22 2016,
g147293,d3609804,February 19 2016,Very kid friendly down side is the walk from the resort up side is the plans to change that! Lots there for family as well while you are supervising your children plus food etc is all available. For those older kids they are okay on their own as its well supervised.
g147293,d3609804,February 18 2016,Safe environment for the kids with lots of waterfalls(in the pools). However aquite a walk from the main buliding if you have mobility issues.
g147293,d3609804,February 17 2016,
g147293,d3672354,March 8 2016,
g147293,d3672354,March 9 2016,had a wonderful day out here the boat crew looked after us from start to finish. The snorkelling was amazing the scenery stunning and the included lunch was beautifully cooked and served fresh fish
g147293,d3672354,March 8 2016,We went there on a Costa Favolosa cruise. Beautiful white sand beach with cristal and turquoise waters.
g147293,d3672354,March 7 2016,
g147293,d3672354,March 5 2016,We took that trip in conjunction with out Saona trip because they offered snorkeling... Mmm nope just another beauty beach and fresh cheap lobster ) the boat sucked... Animation as well snorkeling was pure ...

g147293,d3672354,March 4 2016,It's a beautiful island with white sand and lovely warm blue water. Try the tour with catamaran lunch included (with lobster) :):):). Honestly I prefer Isla Saona ... but it's worth to visit.
g147293,d3672354,March 2 2016,this beach it's just breath taking. the boat ride stops for snorkeling before you get tot he beach. when the boat gets to the beach you will eat lunch (part of the package) and spend the day at the amazing beach. the water is clear enough for you to see your feet.
g147293,d3672354,March 1 2016,Every view from Catalina Island looks like a postcard. Do not miss this place. There are lot of local people and kids around there trying to sell you gifts or picture taken with animals.
g147293,d3672354,February 29 2016,Professional guides safety oriented and knowledgeable. We went to Catalina island on a catermaran lots of fun meet new people and made new friends. Lots of fish to see and the lunch meal was terrific.
g147293,d3672354,February 29 2016,Very fare from Punta Cana beach bottom is rocky and very busy with the boats passing thru the swimmers.
g147293,d3784111,February 28 2016,
g147293,d3784111,March 7 2016,we took a trip off of the resort to visit. Great cigar place chocolate factory and if you want good rum for a fair price and jewelry this is the place to visit! workers are outstanding!
g147293,d3784111,March 6 2016,Good to go and learn excellent to learn about the process of how it is made. Got to taste/ eat many types and drink infused with rum....OMG
g147293,d3784111,March 2 2016,Nestle was our master chocolatier. lol. he was very informative. took us through all the steps to making chocolate. the chocolate was delicious. it was an awesome 2 hours.
g147293,d3784111,February 28 2016,Excellent little tour of the cocoa process and great chocolate! I really enjoyed the whole Don Lucas location they had great staff that was friendly and smart.
g147293,d3784111,February 27 2016,Loved this place. Was shown the actual coco plant and tasted the coco before processing. Brought back chocolate bars cookie dough and coco face night cream that makes my skin feel and smell great!
g147293,d3784111,February 24 2016,It's a small store in Alto de Chavon. Interesting and a good place for souvenirs - chocolate and a chocolate tea that is very good. If you're at Alto de Chavon it's definitely worth a visit but I wouldn't make a specific trip to see it.
g147293,d3784111,February 24 2016,Good for about 10 minutes of distraction then you're done. There's a cigar "museum"a "museum of Dominican crafts" and a chocolate "museum". In the end it's just another gift shop with nothing really to offer.
g147293,d3784111,February 23 2016,
g147293,d3784111,February 19 2016,Very interesting tour. Lots of chocolate! Learned a lot about coco beans even seen a tree in bloom the entire process of making chocolate bars and coco..
g147293,d3784111,February 18 2016,We visited Alto De Chavron and found this great Cacao museum- provides some interesting facts on the process of chocolate production and sells products of course- I got some HIGH grade Cacao powder!

g147293,d3856867,March 9 2016,
g147293,d3856867,March 9 2016,We visited because our resort was gross! Lots to see food was excellent people were friendly. Will consider staying there if we go again
g147293,d3856867,March 9 2016,
g147293,d3856867,March 4 2016,Our group decided to visit the Hard Rock Punta Cana one evening...such a gorgeous place! Tons of shops once inside and as long as you are gambling the drinks are free...make sure you stop and sign up for a players card on your way in ..you will get some free match play.
g147293,d3856867,March 4 2016,The casino at Hardrock was a disappointment. We like blackjack but at 6pm the tables turn to a minimum of $25. Fun for some I guess but a little too high for comfort.
g147293,d3856867,March 3 2016,We stopped here to cool down before going back to the hotel and were greeted by friendly staff. With a cool Stella and a portion of chips who could complain. The interior of the building is great.
g147293,d3856867,March 3 2016,
g147293,d3856867,March 1 2016,Casino was okay -- very smoky. I only play slots not the table games. At any given time during the week I could always find a slot machine I liked to play.
g147293,d3856867,March 1 2016,
g147293,d6439928,March 10 2016,
g147293,d6439928,March 10 2016,This is the most beautiful place I have ever seen! The beach and the blue water is addicting! I suggest the coconut drink...it is a bit expensive but tasted wonderful. We did not want to leave!
g147293,d6439928,March 10 2016,
g147293,d6439928,March 10 2016,We did a catamaran out which was fun. They served drinks as well. The island was nice but I think the beach at our hotel was nicer. The speed boat back was cool and the stop on the sandbar was lots of fun! There's plenty of rum and coke to go around!
g147293,d6439928,March 10 2016,Was it flying in a seaplane over on our way to a lunch in a inn on a pristine beach. Or our incredible day on a chartered yacht in the beach where the family learned to scuba dive?.
g147293,d6439928,March 10 2016,Took a private charter via boat to the island for lunch. Very nice place. Grilled Lobster was delish! Water is warm and crystal clear!
g147293,d6439928,March 10 2016,
g147293,d6439928,March 10 2016,I went to Sanoa Island in 2008 and still remeber it like it was yesterday. If you are heading to La Romana it's not a long boat ride to get there and is so worth it. Don't miss out of this island it is truly a gem. There are limited facilities and be sure to bring sunscreen
g147293,d6439928,March 10 2016,Worth the price. Beautiful beach great food! Catamaran to the island - with music dancing & drinks. Speed boat ride home.
g147293,d6439928,March 10 2016,Isla Saona was a wonderful experience. The food was great the beach awesome tons of loungers......no shade to relax in.
g147293,d6439928,March 9 2016,
g147293,d6854566,March 10 2016,
g147293,d6854566,March 10 2016,I recommend Dominican Plus transfer service for private air conditioned transfer round trip from airport to resort. They met us at the airport and were exactly where they said they would be. And they were early picking us up for our return trip. Our return driver was especially nice. Great job Dominican Plus.
g147293,d6854566,March 10 2016,We used these guys for airport transfers and a transfer between resorts. We booked a private caddy! Very nice had beers and champs cold and waiting for us on each trip! They were always on time and very profssional!
g147293,d6854566,March 9 2016,Cant say anything bad about this transport company ..since pick up to drop off they were very punctual great service I would defenitly book them again !....even had beers waiting for me on the vehicle .
g147293,d6854566,March 6 2016,
g147293,d6854566,March 5 2016,Excellent Services and safe transfers. Best option to visit and enjoy all over the country. I recomend to visit the Colonial City in March an excursión to Samana to humpback whales know that it is only possible to see them this time of year and to visit Isla Catalina and Saona.
g147293,d6854566,March 5 2016,We never had a hitch. We traveled with three couples.. One couple arrived 45min before the rest of us and in a different terminal Oscar handled it perfectly. He was on time courteous funny. Don't forget to ask for beer.. He called ahead and picked it up on the way to the resort.
g147293,d6854566,March 5 2016,
g147293,d6854566,March 4 2016,I booked the Rudi's coconut tour through this company and it was informative. What I really disliked is Rudi took us to specific locations to "buy goods" and the employees were extremely aggressive in trying to force us to buy their goods. This was very annoying and I decided to not buy anything.

g147293,d7615732,March 8 2016,
g147293,d7615732,February 29 2016,I am impressed with this service. Prompt even though our arrival was delayed. On the return trip our flights were delayed and a quick email to change pick up times was confirmed within minutes. Bravo to these people. Will always use this service from now on.
g147293,d7615732,February 24 2016,“The staff there were really nice and made a valiant effort to give us the best experience possible. Once we got there though it was fabulous and we had a blast zip lining. I do believe these are probably better views zip lining than you can find anywhere else in Punta Cana!”
g147293,d7615732,February 20 2016,
g147293,d7615732,February 10 2016,We book an SUV transportation round trip and our valet was right there waiting for us. We spend around 30 minutes to get to our hotel in Breathless Punta cana. Never feel the Luxury of the President style until that day. Thanks Mike. We recommend this company 100% safe and Professional.
g147293,d7615732,February 10 2016,
g147293,d7615732,February 10 2016,Good service on time in new or newish airconditioned mini vans. Not the cheapest but you can negotiate for long journeys. N.B The drivers are polite and helpful but don't all speak English.
g147293,d7615732,February 10 2016,The transfer from the airport was very punctual.The driver was polite and drove us safely to our resort.At the end of our stay they were right there as assigned .
g147293,d7615732,February 10 2016,
g147293,d8047995,March 8 2016,
g147293,d8047995,March 9 2016,Just did a quick bike tour through this condo and yacht filled area. There is a nice point for picture-taking.
g147293,d8047995,March 8 2016,
g147293,d8047995,March 2 2016,
g147293,d8047995,February 9 2016,We went to Marina for a walk and the place is beautiful there are brand name stores and the matches all the environment is nice.
g147293,d8047995,February 9 2016,We visited the marina to use the ATM and have a look at the boats. It was pretty quite at that time in early December. There were lot's of condos for sale. Great place for golfers and going on fishing trips.Very safe gated community.
g147293,d8047995,February 9 2016,this is a gated community in which you have to go through a security guard. Very private and new. This is in the opposite direction as the all inclusive s. This is south and the all inclusive are north
g147293,d8047995,February 9 2016,Stayed at the Aqua Marina condos so visited the Marina several times. Sad place really. Only a couple of shops open one small mini mart and an Italian Restaurant that was not good at all. Pasta with two tiny shrimp !
g147293,d8047995,February 9 2016,Great day at the beach with family and extended family. Incredibly windy but beautiful weather. Good food too!
g147293,d8047995,February 9 2016,The property is very nice the marina is big but mostly empty. The condos are nice. The shopping mall/commercial area is mostly empty still. There are two very good restaurants one on the "beach" (great mahi seviche) and one on the esplenade (Italian).

g147293,d8132454,February 12 2016,Hello Tours does not disappoint! I had read the reviews prior to our travels and they were on target. Our driver was on time and was professional and knowledgeable. I will definitlely use Hello Tours again in our future travels.
g147293,d8132454,February 12 2016,I would recommend the drive and company with above excellent reviews. My driver was absolute fantastic. You are blessed to have him on staff

g147293,d8470541,March 9 2016,
g147293,d8470541,March 9 2016,as far as i'm concerned you can't beat the price and efficiency for your round trip to and from the airport. highly recommended

g147293,d8629697,March 4 2016,Wasn't sure if I was scammed; too tired & hot to argue and there were people waiting in a hot OLD van.
g147293,d8629697,March 3 2016,
g147293,d8629697,March 3 2016,4 hours on the coach we had to go to 4 hotels before we got to the airport not enough stops to go toilet

g147294,d215734,March 7 2016,Yes.. if you want white sand sunshine and a relaxing stay. This ticks all the boxes. We caught a boat from the mainland and stayed on the beach for the day. Plenty of loungers and if you want a drink there is a nice little beach bar.
g147294,d215734,March 2 2016,
g147294,d215734,February 28 2016,
g147294,d215734,February 28 2016,An amazing vacation spot. The 4 restaurants were wonderful but the gourmet restaurant was the most enjoyable dinner we experienced. We had a 6 course meal so if you are a foodee make sure you make your reservations early. The other highlight of our meal enjoyment was found at the buffer which was without equal in my life experience.
g147294,d215734,February 28 2016,The resort grounds were beautiful but cramped. The big white beach is open to the general public raising safety issues for tourists.
g147294,d215734,February 26 2016,
g147294,d215734,February 24 2016,Stunning beach with amazing colour sea cute little market beach bar and you could hire snorkelling gear. It is a public beach but we certainly did not get any hassle

g147294,d2248283,March 8 2016,
g147294,d2248283,March 8 2016,sailing around these mushroom shaped islands and seeing the birds was very interesting as was landing and seeing the cave drawings albeit it was too dark to see them very well. our excursion to them however was very expensive $89 each for the half day so we felt value for money was very poor.
g147294,d2248283,February 25 2016,I took a group of 30+ students to Los Haitises. It was beautiful and peaceful. There is so much to learn and so much to see. The tour guides were superb I was able to see multiple guides speaking several languages. Everything was clean and well kept very safe as well. It is beautiful it is a must see!
g147294,d2248283,February 10 2016,
g147294,d2248283,February 10 2016,
g147294,d2248283,February 10 2016,Floating among the many island teeming with birds and overgrown with tropical trees and bushes is a unique enjoyment.
g147294,d2248283,February 10 2016,Pretty cool experience. I would definitely recommend doing a tour of the national park. I can't remember the tour company we used (was through Air Transat) but the guy was so amazing.
g147294,d2248283,February 10 2016,Lovely boat trip across the bay with rum service :) Guides were friendly and funny. Sites were beautiful and history very interesting. So diverse and rich....mangroves caves birds...rum...
g147294,d2248283,February 10 2016,We went on a trip to Los Haitises while on holiday and it was a good day. The tour guides knew a lot about the park and had lots of knowledge about the caves.
g147294,d2248283,February 10 2016,Great experience its a day excursion and I loved just being out on the ocean. Going into caves and learning of the different species in this area
g147311,d2196148,March 10 2016,
g147311,d2196148,March 10 2016,I highly recommend Real Tours. They are professional courteous prompt and friendly! We arranged private transportation to and from the airport. It was well worth it! Thank you!

g147312,d1367797,February 6 2016,overall was great. did it with my daughter and her 3 friends everyone loved it. great price for the shuttle to dunn river falls
g147312,d1367797,February 6 2016,If you want to party on the way back from dunns river this is the way to go we took the afternoon tour wish we would not have because we were not in the huge party mode however the dj and all crew on the catamaran made so much fun
g147312,d1367797,February 6 2016,I am trying to reach Dunn's River Shuttle by email or by phone. But my email was returned and nobody answered the phone call. Does anybody know how to reach them?
g147312,d1367797,February 6 2016,Try not to fall the trip was reasonably priced. Pretty basic to do and we had a good time climbing the waterfalls the video tram made the climb so much fun. Well worth it
g147312,d1367797,February 6 2016,This was a great experience. The crew members really know how to help you enjoy your time with them. You can't help but have fun.
g147312,d1367797,February 6 2016,This was my second time climbing up the falls. You go with your tour and a guide. You're always holding hands and being told to stop in various places for pictures. Very annoying. You must wear water shoes and be aware of the rocks and holes. Wish there was more freedom and that it lasted for more than 30 min.
g147312,d1367797,February 6 2016,This was a most enjoyable day we climbed the falls to the top then walked back down. There was drinks and snacks to have and time to swim in the blue sea.

g147312,d148211,March 3 2016,We enjoyed this adventure. We called it jarastic park. Nice tour and vendors. We had a nice site. Would recommend others to go on this tour as well.
g147312,d148211,March 1 2016,This is a drive around a winding beautiful part of the mountain area of Jamaica. It used to be a riverbed which is now paved. Nothing too exciting and it is free. Just beauty in the mountains.
g147312,d148211,February 29 2016,Our driver took us through Fern Gully on our way into Ocho Rios. It was absolutely gorgeous. At one point we even stopped and he gave us an opportunity to take photos and learn a little more about the vines which hang from the trees. (actually roots)
g147312,d148211,February 29 2016,We went up through here on way to Bob Marley resting place it was cool and refreshing from the heat and as close to a rain forest you can get I'd not stop and take pics but definitely worth a trip up to see
g147312,d148211,February 28 2016,
g147312,d148211,February 23 2016,Make sure you take your camera!! the tour guides are great to capture the moment. Really fun experience.
g147312,d148211,February 21 2016,what road most enjoyable make shore you take the back road back down the hill our driver was the best told us the history of the road
g147312,d148211,February 18 2016,We drove the fern gully with a private driver and loved it. It is a very windy road that leads up a hill. It is like being in a tropical rain forest as on both sides of the road is full of tall ferns and green plants. There are also some booths along the way to stop and look at.
g147312,d148211,February 14 2016,
g147312,d148211,February 13 2016,We travelled through Fern Gully on our way up to view Ocho Rios look-out up at Shaw Park. Our guide Junior explained the history behind the Gully and all about the vegetation that we passed as well as some of the local sites. Its well worth the trip to see this on your trip in Jamaica.
g147312,d148213,February 29 2016,
g147312,d148213,February 29 2016,We hiked here from our rental home. It was peaceful and very quiet. The falls were beautiful. It was a great alternative to the crazy busy Dunn's River Falls. I don't like crowds so this really was perfect for me.
g147312,d148213,February 26 2016,
g147312,d148213,February 26 2016,We went to Laughing Waters not knowing exactly what to expect and were wowed by it. Though a smaller waterfall it dumps into the ocean and creates an interesting layer effect. But the views were incredible. A must see.
g147312,d148213,February 26 2016,
g147312,d148213,February 26 2016,I'm glad that I have picked this place for my wedding next year. The view the waterfalls just everything about it I LOVED!!
g147312,d148213,February 26 2016,
g147312,d148213,February 26 2016,Sadly laughting waters is closed to the general public. It is such a shame since it is so beautiful there. Luckily I was diving off shore from here so my dive boat captain took me there after a dive. I'm so happy we did since it has been a dream of mine to visit for years.
g147312,d148213,February 26 2016,Nothing to laugh about here the water is clean and blue. I cant wait to get back to the lovely Island of Jamaica.
g147312,d148213,February 26 2016,Spectacular ocean view two (2) spacious gardens luxurious guest house beautiful river running through the property and acces to a well manicured beach front makes this Venue the Perfect Wedding Venue. Always a delight going here for special events. Property no open to the general public but can be booked for private stay or events through UDC Jamaica.
g147312,d148213,February 26 2016,One of the best beach visit I've had. Fruit trees picturesque view lovely beach overlooking the sea. There are so many places to take a picture the flowers make for a colourful backdrop.

g147312,d148606,February 14 2016,On our last day of vacation we grabbed a cab and checked out shaw gardens. I loved it! 10$usd and a guide walks you around. Beautiful waterfall lovely gardens lots of birds. Would definetly reccomend if you did it quickly time 45min we were there for 2h.
g147312,d148606,February 14 2016,These set above Ocho Rios  giving a fine view of the town  consist of acres of streams waterfalls ponds flowers and woods. They are a must visit and guided tours are available.
g147312,d148606,February 14 2016,What a beautiful area. Hidden away from the rest of the touristy attractions. This was by far my favorite excursion while visiting. Our guide Richard was extremely knowledgeable and obviously has a lot of pride in the gardens.
g147312,d148606,February 14 2016,
g147312,d148606,February 14 2016,We got an excellent guide and had a really good time at this place. Very peaceful and scenic place. You could spend several hours here.
g147312,d148606,February 14 2016,The gardens were clean and well kept. The waterfall was gorgeous. We had a guide who identified a lot of the plants. Overall a lovely visit but plants very similar to what we have at home.

g147312,d148614,February 14 2016,White sand - clear blue sea - beaming sun rays - ready available cocktails and pallette pleasing food. This place is paradise. I love it here.
g147312,d148614,February 14 2016,This is a very beautiful beach. The water is clear the color is magnificent and the reef keeps the waves from coming too close to shore.
g147312,d148614,February 14 2016,Awesome atmosphere on the beach. Lots of jerk chicken and drinks. Very relaxing on the deck chairs. Would definitely visit again!!!!
g147312,d148614,February 14 2016,Been here 3 times even got married here. it really is perfect in my eyes. The staff the whole place is amazing it's now run by moon place. but I need to go back.x my kids love the place.x

g147312,d148614,February 14 2016,This hotel is currently under renovations it is located in the town of ochi and next to rooms on the beach. The beach is beautiful white sand beach and clear green water.
g147312,d148614,February 14 2016,We stayed at a private condo at sandcastle ochoriosgetaway dot c0m we had free beach access via our gate. Clean no one bothers you one guy will ask if you want to do water sports. Some parts are grassy in the water most is not.
g147312,d148614,February 14 2016,The beach in front of hotel is closed due to hotel renovations This was bought out by a Mexican company and will be the Moon Palace Resort On the beach in front of hotel - no activity no tourists
g147312,d148614,February 14 2016,We really enjoyed this beach we traveled here april 2013 ...had a great time breath taking and so cool to see the big cruse ship doc sometime!! Def a do if in jamacia just even to relax!!

g147312,d1645961,March 9 2016,
g147312,d1645961,March 6 2016,My hotel was right next to where White river flows into the ocean and one of the nicest beaches in Jamaica. I hired a local fisherman as my guide right on the beach. Best way Mon!
g147312,d1645961,March 3 2016,
g147312,d1645961,February 29 2016,I recommend you stay at KAZ KREOLE LODGE in Ochos Rios if you want to be near this river. We did and this River is amazing and it is cheap to get a boat up the river and play on the river for the day.
g147312,d1645961,February 29 2016,
g147312,d1645961,February 26 2016,After completing our tour in the Blue Hole waterfall we took on the White River by water tubing the currents and rapids. It was an exhilarating experience.
g147312,d1645961,February 26 2016,
g147312,d1645961,February 23 2016,
g147312,d1645961,February 16 2016,There are many parts of this river you can visit for free if you are adventurous enough. It was a short walk from The Blue House.

g147312,d1657047,February 29 2016,
g147312,d1657047,February 9 2016,Love this beach out of all the beaches in and around the Ocho Rios erea..... Just one disappointing thing? The price way to excessive.
g147312,d1657047,February 9 2016,The beach was nice. Good vibe with good music. Thought that the food could have been better. Quite expensive compared to other places.
g147312,d1657047,February 9 2016,Beautiful beach but I found it to be a little pricey. Still I enjoyed my day there. Not far from where I stayed at Sea Palms.
g147312,d1657047,February 9 2016,We had 1/2 jerked chicken which was at best average compared to others we had over the course of a week over-cooked whole snapper and some so-so appetizers. All were expensive.
g147312,d1657047,February 9 2016,This beach so far is the most beautiful beach I have ever visited. the water is so amazing. Aqua blue extremely clean very private the view is to die for  the food is amazing overall the best. Please visit if you are thinking of it.
g147312,d1657047,February 9 2016,After a private tour day inland at Blue Hole etc still got a little beachtime and wandering at Reggae Beach....had a blast while in Ochi on Carnival Conquest!
g147312,d1657047,February 9 2016,You pay to enter this beach - about £12 per person.... Bit steep really but there is the guarantee of no hawkers. There is a beach bar and food is available. Sun loungers are available too.

g147312,d1997485,March 10 2016,This was a fun day driving in the beautiful mountains and stopping at the blue hole. A natural u der water spring. Water is very cool and refreshing. The jump is 35/40/feet but oh what a thrill!!. There is a ladder to climb up and DOWN! Has a pool and bar so u can stay all day.

g147312,d1997485,March 8 2016,Visited this place 2years ago with my husband and 2 of my step kids from England we had a great time especially the kids who were jumping off into the water and really enjoying it getting there is a little bit off the path but its well worth it once there.
g147312,d1997485,March 8 2016,Choice of a 10-15ft cliff dive & a 40ft dive which is up the falls a bit... Diving is not necessary as I saw a few people descending the rock ledges. It's incredibly beautiful on a sunny day and hard to forget
g147312,d1997485,March 7 2016,It's gorgeous clean and the staff are very friendly what more could you ask for? I recommend trying to go when there is not a cruise ship in harbor and/or going early in the day to avoid the crowds.
g147312,d1997485,March 7 2016,We were surprised to learn that the Blue Hole had only been open to the public/tourists for a few years - it is breathtaking and a fun adventure!
g147312,d1997485,March 7 2016,A true surreal site nature at it's best. My teens had a blast and it has to be one of the best days we have spent as a family. Ripe swing Cliff dives and much more.

g147312,d1997485,March 6 2016,The Blue Hole was awesome. Little known place that you do not feel so crowded. It is down a pretty bad road but worth the trip. The guides were awesome and if you like a little more adventure you can climb to the top and jump your way down. So much fun.
g147312,d1997485,March 6 2016,
g147312,d1997485,March 6 2016,
g147312,d1997485,March 5 2016,We visited the Blue Hole and had an absolute blast. Highlight of the entire vacation. Booked with Liberty Tours and wouldn't do it any other way. The guides at the Blue Hole were amazing and an absolute riot!!! Fantastic time. Never felt rushed or crowded. They took great care of us and our camera!!!
g147312,d1997485,March 4 2016,One of the most beautiful places I have ever seen. Jumped off cliffs swing on ropes and walked down waterfalls. If I have my way I will be back next May and spend all day there. Totally awesome!

Not recommended for people with health problems or who cannot walk/hike distances it was quite a hike to get to the hole but once you got there WOW!! It is BEAUTIFUL!! Also take water shoes!! they have them there to rent but are worn out much better if you have your own.

g147312,d1997485,February 28 2016,Great activity. Physical but not overwhelming. I saw older people there too. Georgia. Beautiful. Fun. Take a water camera to get pics!!! Wear some kind of water shoe or gripping sandal or shoe you don't mind getting wet. Safe and refreshing cool water. Simply beautiful and I will go back!
g147312,d1997485,February 28 2016,
g147312,d1997485,February 28 2016,Decided at the last minute to go here instead of Dunn River. So glad we did! Much less crowded very attentive guides I jumped off cliffs for God's sake. Our guide Glenn was the BEST! I'm a non-swimmer but wore a jacket and felt completely at ease. Getting there was an adventure in itself! Highly recommended.
g147312,d1997485,February 28 2016,
g147312,d1997485,February 28 2016,Waterfalls and pools provide the perfect setting for a fun afternoon of wading swimming and rope swinging. Laughs and giggles a plenty - and all accompanied by friendly knowledgeable guides. A must do excursion from Ochie and far less crowded than the boring overrated over crowded Dunns river falls.
g147312,d1997485,February 28 2016,We had no idea what to expect as we were driving up the mountain on a very narrow road but Blue Hole is did not disappoint. It left us speechless with all of it's beauty. We are definitely going back!
g147312,d1997485,February 28 2016,
g147312,d1997485,February 28 2016,This place is amazing! Our guide Devroe made sure we were all safe and having fun! Our two kids (5 and 7) enjoyed it but I wouldn't think kids any younger would be able to participate much. There had been a lot of rain the previous days so the water was not blue but it was still amazing!
g147312,d1997485,February 28 2016,
g147312,d1997485,February 28 2016,Beautiful location and off the beaten track. Not commercialized at all. Peaceful and serene hike up the river to the pools of water. You may jump into the pools of water and there is also a swing. Loved it.
g147312,d1997485,February 27 2016,
g147312,d1997485,February 27 2016,
g147312,d1997485,February 27 2016,Except for the blue hole and the bar there is not much to do but it was fun diving in the blue hole. It use to be free but now you have to pay to enter.
g147312,d1997485,February 27 2016,You can chose your level of diving jumping. Gorgeous place and lots of fun!!!Guides stay with you and help if you need it.

g147312,d2043496,March 10 2016,
g147312,d2043496,March 10 2016,If you like a little adventure this is the place to go. When through chucka tours on the party boat cruise. Well worth the money. Just make sure to bring water shoes or you can buy some for 10 us dollars
g147312,d2043496,March 10 2016,We went with a group from Couples San Souci. Bring water shoes or go early in your trip so your running shoes have time to dry before leaving.
g147312,d2043496,March 10 2016,
g147312,d2043496,March 10 2016,This is a natural wonder but you cannot enjoy it when it is covered by hundreds of cruise ship people making body chains and having their pictures taken at every other stopping point. Check ahead and go when they are not there!!!!

g147312,d2043496,March 9 2016,We had a great time. Be careful and suggest water shoes. As well as ladies be careful with those fancy swim tops. Water is rough and you may expose to all and cameras are rolling ;-)

g147312,d2216744,February 12 2016,Great choice. Good guide in Silvan who was very knowledgeable and advisable. Gave us plenty of time on our visit to Bob Marley residence and Dunns River Falls. Would recommend Jaital to other travellers especially beating the price and rush off cruise ship guides.
g147312,d2216744,February 8 2016,We had a great experience from start to finish! We were greeted with a smile and were offered a transfer to the beach an hour ahead of schedule. The Jaital team was professional attentive and informative. Hats off to our friendly driver Geroy. We will definitely be using Jaital again when we are in Jamaica. Thanks for the great service!

g147312,d2422779,March 2 2016,INGLÊS We made the transfer to doctor 's cave beach and the driver was very punctual and friendly . He spoke about the history of the places we passed and stopped in a place with which to buy souvenirs. About the place... The beach is beautiful but was crowded and there were a lot of people selling and smoking marijuana.

g147312,d2614484,March 2 2016,Courtney is friendly and... simply amazing. The time we had with Courtney Taylor Tours was over our imagination. A great private tour for a competitive price. We went to Blue Hole and Dunn's River Falls. This day was like chocolate topping on a cake.Thank you!

g147312,d265852,February 24 2016,this is a great place to visit good drink ice cream  shops a good afternoon its for familys during the day but evenings it a bit more for adults
g147312,d265852,February 10 2016,There's music and laughter at Margaritaville in here but we went for the excellent ice cream at Scoops. It's Devon House ice cream which I think is the best in Jamaica. Get a drink or a scoop and enjoy it by the beach. Lots of shops for the shopaholics too.
g147312,d265852,February 10 2016,We shopped on a non cruise ship day so a lot of stores weren't open. Also a few vacant stores. Though the did have a Margaritaville!
g147312,d265852,February 10 2016,I like this spot mostly because Margarittaville is there! When the cruise ships are in port it's gets quite busy.
g147312,d265852,February 10 2016,Unfortunate what has happened to this place no more music on the compound barely any stores just generic indian jewellers and a few souvenir stores.. this place needs an injection of energy
g147312,d265852,February 10 2016,Excellent place to visit and spend the day. We had a great time on the beach and visiting all the craft shops.
g147312,d265852,February 10 2016,
g147312,d265852,February 10 2016,Great place for the ladies to shop without being hassled by beggers and locals. Good food nearby at Margarittaville
g147312,d265852,February 10 2016,We went here for shopping and we loved itThey have quite a few stores even a movie theaterWe bought souvenirs and they were very reasonably pricedIt's also close to the cruise ship pierThey even have a little ice cream shopWe recommend this for families Or if you just want to go somewhere and hang out for a little bit
g147312,d265852,February 10 2016,Another good place to get off the ship and walk a few minutes to the Island Village. Shops here are connected with wooden sidewalks and there are number of interesting shops to pop into.

g147312,d274030,March 10 2016,The #1 marine attraction in Jamaica with it's key attractor: dolphins. These magnificent creator's provides with there thrilling acrobatic activity and a chance to swim with these lovely creators. Also on the park are sharks string rays a bird aviary and lizards. Its not cheap but worth every penny.
g147312,d274030,March 10 2016,A great experience to swim with the dolphins or encounter them as my little son did. The experience was great the photos they took available for purchase were sharp and well documented. although pricey.

g147312,d274030,March 9 2016,The swim was unorganized and they tried to jam more people in the group than they should have which made the whole experience feel extremely rushed. We did this excursion a few years ago and had a way better experience.
g147312,d274030,March 9 2016,
g147312,d274030,March 9 2016,there was two of us and it was amazing - they were well looked after there was no hard sales and the dolphins appeared to really enjoy themselves - one of the best experiences I have ever had

g147312,d538092,March 4 2016,I wouldn't say it was the best beach but it's lovely to relax and see the cruise ships dock very interesting to see. You have to pay to use this beach but it's only $3.00
g147312,d538092,February 28 2016,There are better beaches in Jamaica so hard to rate this as high but nevertheless still a nice beach to relax on the ships are in and out all week and always interesting watching these huge liners "fit in" to the bay

When going up a mountain with a narrow road to the blue hole she managed to back up and let a car go through without falling off the cliff. She was fun and exciting. We will be back in 2017.

g147312,d7305078,March 10 2016,In the cool vegetative hill's of Ocho Rios stands a beautiful garden and through it runs a mystical fall's. This is suited for nature lovers and photographers due to the garden beautiful scenery. So next trip to Jamaica give Konoko fall's a try u won't regret it

g147312,d7305078,February 29 2016,There is a $20/person entry fee for this 'park". It is a collection of trees/plants and animals in cages. A guide attached himself to us and thus we had to tip him for his vast knowledge of stuff that nobody really cared about. The guided tour took less than an hour. Save your money and have a few beers instead!!
g147312,d7305078,February 28 2016,A must see while in Jamaica...beautiful gardens and water falls. Extremely knowledgable tour guides and friendly. The exotic flora and plants are spectacular and so local wildlife to see too!
g147312,d7305078,February 27 2016,
g147312,d7305078,February 27 2016,There were 20 in the group so the helpers had their job to do. They helped everyone get up the falls. Kenroy was our guide and he was great as were all of them. the video was great make sure you buy one before you leave of your experience.

g147312,d777315,February 27 2016,This tour was very educational and exciting; especially when entering the bird sanctuary. I had birds standing on my head and feeding off my hands. The only regret was that the waterfall water was brown we were able to enjoy only 4 waterfalls instead of the advertised 14.
g147312,d777315,February 26 2016,Park is getting run down but still enjoyable. Pool was not open and garbage in forest near paths. The birds is why I gave them 4 stars
g147312,d777315,February 20 2016,We were extremely pleased to meet some of the ladies who are grounds keepers. They provided us with a plethora of flora and fauna names and locations. What a pleasant spot in the middle of this port city. This is a great place to take your family to enjoy wildlife for FREE
g147312,d777315,February 8 2016,
g147312,d777315,February 8 2016,20USD$ pp. to enter and get a quide. I did find the cost too expensive. This park has several waterfalls very nice. The guide Jordan was wonderful. At the end there is an aviary no domestic birds caged in we did not like this at all. Took 1hour to tour.
g147312,d777315,February 8 2016,We came across this park whilst exploring the Ochos Rios town. It is a well maintained park that is peaceful. There are public restrooms inside the park are ponds and trees and you can see big fish and turtles. The entrance is situated close to the cruise terminal.
g147312,d777315,February 8 2016,The park is about ten minutes walk from the cruise ship terminal right in Downtown Ocho Rios. It's very well-maintained and landscaped and it's relaxing strolling in this pretty city park. We enjoyed our visit and took lots of pictures a couple of which are shown here.
g147312,d777315,February 8 2016,Beautifully landscaped. My daughter loves turtles and they swam right over to us. It was quiet and peaceful. We have some beautiful photos.I read about this on Trip Advisor before we wentand I am thrilled that we stopped by.

g147313,d148623,March 10 2016,We stayed in about the middle of 7 mile beach. There is alot to do see and experience just by walking along the beach.
g147313,d148623,March 10 2016,We enjoyed our two nights staying at the beach but that was really enough for us. We felt safe and only had a couple of hustlers that pushed a little too hard. Other than that people were very friendly good bars and good restaurants.
g147313,d148623,March 10 2016,Seven mile beach is amazing! The water is so refreshing and the sand is wonderful. It's my exact image in my head of what Jamaica is like. Beautiful beaches and reggae playing at all the little bars and grills along the beach friendly locals selling their crafts and hair braiding and boat rides. Amazing time can't wait to go back.
g147313,d148623,March 10 2016,White loose sand beautiful clear blue water and great beach front restaurants...all a couple of girls need to feel relaxed and enjoy Jamaica. We love going to Negril Jamaica and laying out by seven mile beach.. it truly is paradise.

g147313,d148623,March 5 2016,This beach is what everyone pictures Jamaica to be. White sands with crystal clear water and drinks in coconut shells. There are a large number of vendors trying to sell massages fruit weed etc.; but a firm no thank you was usually respected. Definitely worth a visit!
g147313,d148623,March 5 2016,Sure it has a long slow entry into the water. It also has too many bars chairs and hawkers selling stuff. Give me the cliffs on the West End or Bloody Bay.
g147313,d148623,March 5 2016,Lovely beach very well looked after recommended for everyone as loungers in the sun & shade water is very clear brilliant for snorkelling
g147313,d148623,March 4 2016,This is a wonderful Beach to walk along with the water so warm and inviting. Great for a "2 a day walk"
g147313,d148623,March 4 2016,Yeah Mon! "We don't have problems just situations" are a few of the things that you will hear while in Jamaica. But I must tell you from my experience that there were absolutely no problems or situations on 7 mile beach! I had an amazing time.
g147313,d148623,March 4 2016,Beautiful! You have to get used to peddlers constantly approaching you to sell things but if you're not interested - just say no thank you ... and they respect that (for the most part).
g147313,d148623,March 4 2016,Beautiful beach and the sunsets are to die for. Just not peaceful people in your face the whole time trying to sell you things. Way too many drugs
g147313,d148623,March 3 2016,
g147313,d148623,March 3 2016,
g147313,d148623,March 3 2016,We stayed right on the beach at Negril Beach Club Condos  and spent everyday wandering the beautiful beach swimming in a weed free rock free and sea urchin free ocean. Lots of food and beverage options along the length of the beach and we found the vendors less pushy than in other parts of Jamaica
g147313,d148623,March 3 2016,Very clean clear and calm most of the time. I have been to the seven mile beach in grand Cayman but this is much better because it is much more level for walking and it is much clearer.
g147313,d148623,March 3 2016,Great for walking and meeting various characters. A polite 'no thank you' is usually enough if you're not interested in what they happen to be selling. Lots of good food and drink options as you stroll along and check out the great sunsets
g147313,d148623,March 3 2016,Always wonderful..loved spending the day here! Great day at the new zanzi beach where we got chairs umbrellas and great service !
g147313,d148623,March 3 2016,Gorgeous sand. Lifeguard assisted our group in getting lawn chairs. Drinks were available at numerous beach bars for a great price. What ruined it was the never ending incessant vendors who were hawking everything. You could not be left alone for more than 5 min. which wrecked the whole experience.
g147313,d148623,March 2 2016,If you are a beach lover this is perfect for you. The beach is long-long-long the sand is white-yellow-ish very fine. The best part is there is no rough broken shell belt at all. Local people who are trying to make a living by selling you fruits excursions etc. are only polite asking not pesty.
g147313,d148623,March 2 2016,
g147313,d148623,March 2 2016,Walking up and down the beach was amazing! You can do a little shopping if you want or just play in the waves. The sand is soft and warm.
g147313,d148623,March 2 2016,
g147313,d148623,March 1 2016,Too many peddlers however understandable. Otherwise fantastic experience and loved the bars along the beach.
g147313,d148623,March 1 2016,
g147313,d148623,March 1 2016,
g147313,d148623,March 1 2016,This beach is very crowded. Forget about taking long walk down the beach because its not going to happen. The sand is very beautiful and white. It's just too crowded to relax. Waves were rough when we were there.
g147313,d148623,March 1 2016,We just got back from staying at Beaches Resort on 7 mile beach. This is one of the best beaches I have experienced. Very clean and not too overcrowded. We didn't walk the whole 7 miles but what we saw we liked.
g147313,d148623,March 1 2016,Spent a few hours on this strip of beach and took in the people watching sights. You really can't intermingle between the sections but you can walk trough the water. Nothing to write home about when snorkeling here. It was just water and sand.
g147313,d148623,March 1 2016,Stopped for a short while due to weather in way to Negril hostel calm-ish waters lots of atmosphere. Beautiful views of coastline
g147313,d148623,March 1 2016,Love Negril beach and the interesting locals the sand water and sunshine is a relief from winter been here 12 times now thank God for his blessings and creating such a beautiful place
g147313,d148623,February 29 2016,i had fun  rented a cabanna by Margaritaville and me and my girls enjoyed ourselfs. the water was fun . the locals are cool
g147313,d148623,February 29 2016,
g147313,d148623,February 29 2016,
g147313,d148623,February 29 2016,We visited Sandals Negril for the day and very much enjoyed the property and the fact that you can walk along the beach for miles! Beautiful bay. Natural vegetation between properties and public access points sprinkled in between resorts. Worth a visit!

g147313,d148623,February 28 2016,
g147313,d148623,February 28 2016,This beach can't be beat. Lots of beautiful sand and many things to see. Shops run by locals. Local food always plentiful.
g147313,d148623,February 28 2016,Seven mile beach Negril is gorgeous. Best sunset! Wow. Ocean was different everyday restaurants all along and friendly hustlers doing their thing ! Love seven mile!!
g147313,d148623,February 28 2016,Seven Mile beach is beautiful but missed the cozy feeling of island tranquility....I preferred Bloody Bay
g147313,d148623,February 28 2016,Beautiful clean beach with clear calm waters. Hard sea bed so nice and easy to walk out. It was nice to walk down the beach and not really being pestered
g147313,d148623,February 28 2016,Great beach. Funny thing is that there was a storm a few days before we arrived (Jan 26- Feb 5). Huge mounds of seaweed. The management of our hotel and I'm sure others were horrified. But being from an Island east Canada we are use to seaweed. Lesson>> can't be shovelled away 😀🌴
g147313,d148623,February 28 2016,Stunning. Perfect. The picture doesn't do it justice. White sand. Shallow water. No undertow. Ignore the salespeople and lay back and relax
g147313,d148623,February 27 2016,
g147313,d148623,February 27 2016,
g147313,d148623,February 27 2016,
g147313,d148623,February 26 2016,Take a walk along the seven mile beach. It's breath taking. Just thinking about it puts a smile on my face.
g147313,d148623,March 10 2016,
g147313,d148623,March 10 2016,Best experience ever i love the beach the food the culture the music the people The husslers can be somewhat annoying but please remember they need to make a living also times are hard for all..
g147313,d148623,March 10 2016,We stayed in about the middle of 7 mile beach. There is alot to do see and experience just by walking along the beach.
g147313,d148623,March 10 2016,We enjoyed our two nights staying at the beach but that was really enough for us. We felt safe and only had a couple of hustlers that pushed a little too hard. Other than that people were very friendly good bars and good restaurants.
g147313,d148623,March 10 2016,Seven mile beach is amazing! The water is so refreshing and the sand is wonderful. It's my exact image in my head of what Jamaica is like. Beautiful beaches and reggae playing at all the little bars and grills along the beach friendly locals selling their crafts and hair braiding and boat rides. Amazing time can't wait to go back.
g147313,d148623,March 10 2016,White loose sand beautiful clear blue water and great beach front restaurants...all a couple of girls need to feel relaxed and enjoy Jamaica. We love going to Negril Jamaica and laying out by seven mile beach.. it truly is paradise.
g147313,d148623,March 10 2016,
g147313,d148623,March 10 2016,Seven Mile Beach has everything a visitor could want from music food  It is a must if visiting Negril
g147313,d148623,March 9 2016,We have traveled to a few places in Jamaica and this is our favorite. So much better than Montego Bay even if it is a long drive (1.5 hours) from the airport).
g147313,d148623,March 9 2016,
g147313,d148623,March 8 2016,
g147313,d150411,March 10 2016,
g147313,d150411,March 10 2016,Lovely to walk around among all the amazing trees and plants. Jamaica's national fruit ackee is to see on several of the trees.
g147313,d150411,March 6 2016,
g147313,d150411,March 2 2016,Went to Negril from Ocho Rios. I prefer Ocho Rios because our Resort in my opinion is top notch. Club Hotel Riu We visited the light house on a whim because I am a light house nut. It was very nice and the weather was beautiful.
g147313,d150411,February 27 2016,We had an unexpected surprise when arriving in Negril and found this quaint light house. We had the opportunity to climb the 104 stairs to the top and get an amazing view of the sea side cliffs
g147313,d150411,February 15 2016,wasn't able to go inside but the view from the cliffs are amazing. People actually fish from that high in the air
g147313,d150411,February 15 2016,This is a landmark that doesn't appear to get many visitors. We passed by several times and it didn't appear that it was a terribly popular attraction. Nice views from The Rockhouse.
g147313,d150411,February 11 2016,Worth going there although pretty much run down. We went there to watch the sunset several times. It is only accessable during the day.
g147313,d150411,February 11 2016,My wife and I climbed to the top of the lighthouse not this time but a couple years ago. Great view!!
g147313,d150411,February 10 2016,Experienced the taste of sea/sand grapes and walnuts. Tasty And we had a daredevil that jumped from the cliffs. Lloyd Davis with JAH Lives Taxi and Tours @ 876/392-7231.
g147313,d150411,February 8 2016,We went mid morning and walked around the grounds. A native came and offered to show us around. He was pleasant well spoken and not pushy. He offer to jump the cliffs for us. We declined but he took our photo and we tipped him a few dollars.

g147313,d1728930,March 5 2016,
g147313,d1728930,March 4 2016,The falls are really quite beautiful and the water is so milk with minerals making these falls well worth a visit. The only downside for me was that the staff behaved as if they were doing you a real favour by letting you pay to be there which did take the edge off a little. Quite inhospitable.
g147313,d1728930,March 3 2016,What a awesome thing to do. Walking in natural spring water. It was fun and safe however it was a lot of walking to get to the spring water walk. A ton of steps if you are not an active person and don't like to walk DO NOT DO THIS.
g147313,d1728930,March 2 2016,Excellent adventure! Ask for either Oral S. or Garfield R. as your tor guide. Beautiful tropical view. The falls are huge but it still gives you a sense of what it feels like to stand under a waterfall. Delicious lunch follows this fun adventure.

g147313,d1733504,March 7 2016,We used this company coming and going to the Rock house. So sweet. The drivers were kind and funny. They even stopped at a stores so we could buy beer etc. Vans were very clean!
g147313,d1733504,March 2 2016,
g147313,d1733504,February 29 2016,Rocky's provided great transportation for us. We actually got to ride with Rocky who appears to be quite an ambitious business man planning to but another large van for transporting people. Good luck to your new endeavors.
g147313,d1733504,February 29 2016,Great ride to and from airport....won't use anyone else!! Drivers were on time and offered history of the Island as well as made you feel safe as Jamaica is a crazy place to drive lol
g147313,d1733504,February 28 2016,
g147313,d1733504,February 28 2016,Booking with Rocky's was easy and simple. Every detail went as planned and we definitely will use Rocky's again!! Thanks so much!

If your not used to Third World style cab rides Relax! Just be glad your not driving and concentrate on the scenery.... They will get you there safely!
g147313,d1957478,February 26 2016,
g147313,d1957478,February 26 2016,If your looking for a ride or tour Thriller is for you. Safe reliable and very friendly. I have been riding with them for close to 30 years. The family is the best. Once you meet them your also family. Very clean shuttle vans and safe drivers. Give them a call you will smile the whole time.
g147313,d1957478,February 11 2016,
g147313,d1957478,February 8 2016,I use thriler tours for transfers to/from the airport for rides to shopping and excursions. They have clean safe busses courteous and knowledgeable drivers and good service.
g147313,d1957478,February 8 2016,
g147313,d1957478,February 8 2016,Have used thriller tours for years. They are trustworthy reliable and know the island. Also they are safe drivers.
g147313,d1957478,February 8 2016,Andy of Thriller Tours picked us up at the airport. Right on time! Very safe driver. Took us on personal tours of Negril and area wherever we wanted to go. Reasonable rates. Also used other drivers from the family company. Very reliable. Clean vans.
g147313,d1957478,February 8 2016,
g147313,d1957478,February 8 2016,Taxi is expensive in Jamaica. So try to get a car rental. We rented taxi's for coming to hotel fromthe airport. And we had a txai for two more days. But they are expensive.
g147313,d1957478,February 8 2016,Andy was selected by our hotel to transfer us to/from the Airport and around the hotel. Great bloke and very friendly service. Well worth booking!

g147313,d2010771,March 10 2016,
g147313,d2010771,March 10 2016,Driver was prompt friendly helpfuland very good at sharing his knowledge of the area Did not mind waiting while we stayed in a humming bird garden longer than planned.
g147313,d2010771,March 9 2016,Used Turner to and from airport. Germaine was prompt and very accommodating stopping for lunch and to grocery shop along the way (just be sure to tip him). Gave some island history too. Good rate.
g147313,d2010771,March 8 2016,
g147313,d2010771,March 8 2016,Our third time using their services. Prompt pick up at the airport return pick up on time. Clean air conditioned cars. No more refreshments though in previous years we were offered water and beer not this year

g147313,d2491846,March 10 2016,
g147313,d2491846,March 10 2016,We enjoyed kayaking to Booby Cay Island!!! We brought some red stripe and loved checking it out what a great time!!!
g147313,d2491846,March 8 2016,Six of us went on this excursion with Captain Billy and Riley and had a great time. Stopped to snorkel on the reef and then to the island for lobster and chicken grilled over wood fires. Met a lot of great people from all over the world. Had a blast.
g147313,d2491846,March 7 2016,
g147313,d2491846,March 4 2016,
g147313,d2491846,March 3 2016,The snorkeling was better than average. The lobster lunch was adequate. A small lobster was about five bites. Spring for the twenty buck one. Honestly I'd go out to the reef a bit away from the rush of the island. It was pleasant but not a huge value.
g147313,d2491846,February 28 2016,Glass bottom boats like to take groups here and cook lobster or chicken. This small island is visited by multiple boat loads a day. Might be ok if there was somewhere to sit besides broken picnic tables. Also mound of garbage left by the boat groups. If you go take water shoes as it is very rocky in water
g147313,d2491846,February 24 2016,This was a lot of fun and very cool how the lobsters are caught by the locals and grilled up right there for you.
g147313,d2491846,February 22 2016,I love hopping a boat ride to the island for lobster or even just to walk around a bit away from all the crowds. But who am I kidding? I always get the lobster when I'm there. :) Tip: negotiate on the price they quote you.
g147313,d2491846,February 21 2016,We go to booby cay with Captain Jack every year. We always enjoy that little island.it's even more special for us now as my boyfriend decided to pop the question there last March :)They have fresh lobster and conch that they cook over a wood fire. It is a pretty unique and romantic experience.
g147313,d2491846,February 11 2016,My wife and I have gone out to the island and Capt. Moses has fixed us a lobster dinner oven an open pit. Great lunch. We had fun!!

g147313,d2717063,March 6 2016,Gary was great. Second visit and used his taxi both times. Very timely and dependable. Knows areas well and got us to and from safely. Highly recommend.
g147313,d2717063,March 5 2016,Had a great time on our first trip to Jamaica. Gary Barbara and Fabian all helped us out and were great tour guides pointing out things to see and good places to eat and visit. We will definitely visit and call them again. Thanks for the memories!
g147313,d2717063,March 2 2016,Gary was very nice stopped for refreshments & eats & money exchange and was very knowledgeable about Jamaica. We most definitely will use his services again.
g147313,d2717063,March 2 2016,Gary's hospitality went above and beyond to make our trip great! Her made it possible to see things we would not have been able to on a bus.
g147313,d2717063,February 26 2016,Gary is the best tour guide! Call him and he is alway there. Very dependable and reasonable. I have used him for many years now. Another great exprience with him.

g147313,d274414,March 10 2016,
g147313,d274414,March 10 2016,We went on a Catamaran cruise to Negril cliffs. We swim off the boat towards the cliffs. We witnessed young (teenagers) locals jump and dive from the tops of the cliffs. The boys asked for money for their performances.
g147313,d274414,March 9 2016,The best vibes .......some many places we always wish we had more time. A wonderful place greatest memories
g147313,d274414,March 7 2016,There are several bars and restaurants at the west end of Negril where you can have a drink or eat dinner and watch the sunset while looking at the expanse of the Caribbean and down at the turquoise waters. I've never experienced anything like it.
g147313,d274414,March 7 2016,The Negril Cliffs is such a nice and wonderful place to be spending your time in so breath taking and indeed beautiful and the locals here are so friendly too.
g147313,d274414,March 6 2016,Great spot! Fun to watch all the divers and sunsets. Enjoyed cold red stripes and live entertainment while we were there.
g147313,d274414,March 6 2016,4 members of my family of 10 jumped the clift at Rick's Cafe. Was an important life experience they said.
g147313,d274414,March 6 2016,definitely worth visiting! sunset dinner at Ricks is also good to do although the food is average so expect the scenery and the cliff jumpers to be better. still worth going to!
g147313,d274414,March 6 2016,A perfect place if you want total privacy and no harassment from over aggressive vendors on the street. I am inclining towards taking my next trip into the cliffs again. There are some great restaurants and very good resorts to be explored there.
g147313,d274414,March 4 2016,While I am not a jumper it was extremely exciting an entertaining to watch the locals as well as the tourist jump. Quite a few backed out but who would blame them? Certainly not I. Watching eating and drinking makes for great relaxation.
g147313,d4153585,March 4 2016,
g147313,d4153585,March 4 2016,We used this company (booked via internet) to meet us at airport on arrival and also to take us back after our holiday. Spot on time both times. Highly recommended. They do independent tours also.

g147313,d4153585,February 28 2016,Joe delegated the trip to Kevin a knowledgeable and helpful tour guide who drove us from Negril to our second destination: Ochie. The vehicle was in perfect condition and the fare was $120 which we thought reasonable for a 2 hour journey.
g147313,d4153585,February 25 2016,Such great service prompt & on time with great info provided on way to the hotel with nice air con vehicle lovely touch with cold red stripe & diet coke

g147313,d4312882,February 11 2016,We attended Mass on Sunday at 10 AM. It was a short ride from our hotel on Bloody Bay and well worth the trip. The local children sang before Mass which was wonderful. Father Jim gives an excellent homily. He even blessed us after Mass as it was our honeymoon.
g147313,d4312882,February 11 2016,
g147313,d4312882,February 11 2016,We went to mass at 7p.m. on Christmas eve - 2015 - very comfortable and homey church. There were about 30 people visiting with most being Canadian priest was well spoken and we appreciated his candor. Thank you for being so accepting. Hope the kids liked the candy canes!!
g147313,d4312882,February 11 2016,
g147313,d4312882,February 11 2016,You will feel part of the community! Lots of love in the very small church. Many tourists along with residents. No issues with safety. We had a driver take us and pick us up.
g147313,d4312882,February 11 2016,Mass at Mary Gate of Heaven was one of the highlights of our trip to Negril. Fr. Jim's homily was very powerful and eye opening shedding light on some of the hardships and realities of Jamaicans. The parishioners were very warm and inviting One of the most cherished Masses I've been part of. We look forward to visiting again soon.
g147313,d4312882,February 11 2016,Best church we have ever attended while on vacation. Everyone was so easy going. Loved the participation by the children.
g147313,d4312882,February 11 2016,Mass is held on Sundays 10 am year round and also on Saturdays at 5 pm.during the high season. Visitors are welcomed by the congregation. The parish is very active in serving the local community. Vacation is a great time for giving thanks to the Lord !
g147313,d4312882,February 11 2016,The best of our trip this past year was attending mass and watching the children getting up front with instruments and singing. What a way to praise God.

g147313,d6403451,February 26 2016,Basically guaranteed to see at least 2 hummers up close. We saw three and hand fed 2 including the doctor bird. Loads of other birds species and of course gekkos and other lizards. If you're going to be anywhere near the lighthouse call ahead to Barney and his team for an hour in his lovely garden.
g147313,d6403451,February 24 2016,
g147313,d6403451,February 24 2016,
g147313,d6403451,February 22 2016,Gorgeous garden was lovely just wondering around. With patience the humming birds will come and drink out of a tiny bottle provided which was a great experience. Saw some beautiful butterflies too. Good activity if looking for something different do to away from the beach.
g147313,d6403451,February 16 2016,This is a brilliant place to get close to the very charming and colourful world of the humming birds

g147313,d640673,February 10 2016,
g147313,d640673,February 10 2016,Beach is fun and different from Negrils Beach. You take a boat to Calico Jacks where they have a bar w music and food nice afternoon. The water was rough going to the island and then it wouldn't start. Like Gilligans Island. All went well in the end.
g147313,d640673,February 10 2016,an acceptional peaceful experience with the best bbq lobster Captain Nimmo was so well organised he even brought the drinks from the boat to the beach and he and his team looked after us for the duration of our stay. - wonderful.
g147313,d640673,February 10 2016,This place is really nice but is expensive to get to and pay for entrance and if you want to eat or go to Calico Jacks it can get very expensive for a couple of hours.
g147313,d640673,February 10 2016,Lovely shaded cove/beach with beach loungers and a hammock. Restaurant/bar and even a lady available for massages if you wanted one. Go early if you can as it's quieter. We decided to leave around lunchtime as a noisy tourist boat arrived!

g147313,d644501,February 10 2016,This water park is one of the most fun and exciting spots in Jamaica. THERE'S NEVER-ENDING FUN.....UNTIL ITS TIME TO LEAVE. The staff quality is excellent food and entertainment is awesome.....I'd go back over and over again!!!!!
g147313,d644501,February 10 2016,The park was somewhat small but great for the kids. There was no lines for the rides. It was a good experience.
g147313,d644501,February 10 2016,
g147313,d644501,February 10 2016,Our second visit. This adventure land will drive the kid out of you. Great memories and family time starts here.
g147313,d644501,February 10 2016,Totally made the trip I was on even more memorable! Went on every slide...thought there were more though.... Really loved the atmosphere! Keep it up hoping to return!
g147313,d644501,February 10 2016,My kids had a good time here but there wasn't much there. Some great slides a kiddie pool and a wave pool. I hope they can add more.
g147313,d777027,March 10 2016,
g147313,d777027,March 10 2016,Very nice beach and warm swimming. Fish to see in the swimming areas. Sand very pleasant but need to be up reasonably early to get a hotel sun bed on the beach due to the popularity. Would be rated higher but for the locals trying to sell you drugs cigarettes cigars etc
g147313,d777027,March 9 2016,
g147313,d777027,March 8 2016,This is a lovely bay to stay by and the RIU Negril offers a great spot at the end of the bay to base your holiday.
g147313,d777027,March 7 2016,The Bloody Bay is such a wonderful place to be spending your time in at the nature here is just so amazingly beautiful. Breath taking indeed.
g147313,d777027,March 6 2016,A great walkable beach with crystal clear and calm water. You can pass many resorts and vendors. Safe and secure.
g147313,d777027,March 1 2016,We stayed at the RIU Palace Tropical and it was great. The water was nice the beach was not over crowded.

g147342,d148993,March 7 2016,What a beautiful beach just like you see in the holiday magazines. We were fortunate to see 3 Pelicans diving into the water searching for fish a spectacular sight too see.
g147342,d148993,March 2 2016,This was another part of an excellent tour and what a wonderful view looking down to this beautiful bay and once there it will not disappoint you.
g147342,d148993,February 27 2016,Like the name suggests it's a bay but an amazing beautiful bay specially if you view it from above . Beachhotels restaurants and the usual at a bay. The impressive part of this one it's its beauty. A must!
g147342,d148993,February 14 2016,That's about it really it's a nice bay with nice boats beach and restaurants but can't call it a must see. If you're passing by have a look otherwise don't make a special detour there are lots of places like this on the islan.
g147342,d148993,February 11 2016,Did this trip in the day and was disappointed as it was hyped up to me and my wife. We then did this on another trip at dusk and it was much better. The Sunset was impressive as well as the bay with lights on as the light gradually faded. Well worth the romantic trip at dusk.
g147342,d148993,February 10 2016,the beach here is fantastic and very quiet we had lunch at a cafe overlooking this beach food was delish!
g147342,d148993,February 10 2016,Stopped for a quick tour of the bay on the Joe Knows Tour and was caught by the beauty of the Bay. I belive the first Dr Doolittle movie was filmed there. Would like to have spent some more time but had to get back to the resort.
g147342,d148993,February 9 2016,This is a slow paced comfortable cove. Just the right amount and variety of restaurants and bars. Marsala is a good place to eat and Hurricane Hole Pub is my choice for happy hour and sunset. Rent a villa above the bay for best digs. Marigot Bay just makes your blood pressure fall through the floor.
g147342,d148993,February 9 2016,We stayed at Capella in Marigot Bay. It was absolutely beautiful. A great place if you are lucky enough to have a yacht.

g147342,d149013,February 12 2016,
g147342,d149013,February 12 2016,Beautiful beach not too crowded convention- beach chairs and umbrellas available at a very reasonable price food and drinks at Spinnaker (a little pricey for the quality). Ample water sports activities available- water sofa jet skiis. Do not miss eating food from a local vendor- Liz's Roti- she has amazing roti's- fish roti chicken roti etc.
g147342,d149013,February 12 2016,
g147342,d149013,February 12 2016,This is a good beach convenient to town in Rodney Bay . It is a good beach to walk up and down. Many lounges and umbrellas may be found . It is a good beach to people-watch.
g147342,d149013,February 12 2016,Must visit beach in St lucia. Frequented by locals and tourists alike. Lots of vendors around selling tourist trap products.

g147342,d149062,March 1 2016,Ti Kaye Resort is on a cliff several flights of stairs up from the beach. There's a great dive shop (Island Divers) and decent beach bar restaurant.

g147342,d149062,February 6 2016,Remote bay with perfect snorkelling - one of the best places to snorkel in st lucia. Ti kaye has an amazing restaurant here on the beach.
g147342,d149062,February 6 2016,We stayed at Ti Kaye and were able to use the beach and the loungers which was nice. The beach was very peaceful and had great scenery. The snorkeling was just ok. Nothing too special. I would recommend snorkeling early if you can since other resorts have excursions here and it can get pretty crowded and busy in the afternoon.
g147342,d149062,February 6 2016,Paradise is not enough to explain the majestic beauty views are insane and the photos don't even do this place justice what a majestic amazing place felt like heaven
g147342,d149062,February 6 2016,Excellent beach to relax at; great snorkeling opportunities and beautiful scenery. You don't need to stay at Ti Kaye to visit and you can access the beach without having to drive up to the resort.

g147342,d149211,March 10 2016,Nice views over Rodney Bay but the dhort walk up the hill with a moderate historical interest was not worth the entrance fee. It was nice to stop for a drink in one of the beach restaurants/bars just outside the entrance of the national park with locals and tourists.
g147342,d149211,March 10 2016,
g147342,d149211,March 9 2016,Love love love it. At the top of Island a very special place. The beaches are quiet but lots of action on the water to watch. Take a picnic or visit small cafe. You will probably want to come back again and again we did.

g147342,d149211,March 5 2016,Interesting couple of hours spent on Pigeon Island looking at the old fortifications. Sensible shoes are requifed as some of the paths are stony and very steep especially up to Fort Rodney! There is a cafe serving a range of food and beverages together with a small but sandy beach.

g147342,d149211,March 5 2016,Self-guided walking around with nice high viewpoints and informative booklet (buy at entry). Delightful little cafe on shoreline with history!

g147342,d149221,March 6 2016,This beach is straight off a post card. Absolutely beautiful. Situated between the Pitons mountains this is such a tranquil and unique setting  the best in Saint Lucia. Highly recommend visiting here for a day or staying here if you can afford it!

g147342,d149221,February 21 2016,This is the most amazing beach on the entire island. Find a place to stay that has a free shuttle to this beach and make it a daily stop. Grab your snorkel gear and go snorkel for free or lay on the beach. There's also a restaurant with some awesome pizza :)

g147342,d149221,February 21 2016,Water is just perfect. Lots of food options around. Most of the beach front is taken up by the Sugar beach resort buy open to public also.
g147342,d149221,February 21 2016,
g147342,d149221,February 21 2016,Beautiful white sand beach located right between the Pitons. Amazing views and amazing water. We arrived there by boat from Soufriere and spent a couple hours at the beach as part of an island tour. Definitely a highlight of Saint Lucia and not to be missed. I cant wait to go back again.
g147342,d149221,February 21 2016,Beautiful beach in between the Pitons that is located at the Sugar beach resort. Calm waters for swimming and we saw a variety of fish and an eel while snorkeling. It is a quick five minute ride on a water taxi to get to the beach.
g147342,d149221,February 21 2016,This place is amazing. The Viceroy owns the place but the beach is public. I think its overpriced but it sure is beautiful. 2 nights and I paid over 1800 total.
g147342,d149221,February 21 2016,All beaches in St. Lucia are public even if there is a ritzy resort close by. This beach is a marine reserve with great snorkeling. The fish variety is great but what got me was the coral. Beautiful shapes and colors.
g147342,d149221,February 21 2016,Part of the Cosol Tour itinerary. Came here by speedboat...a fun trip. The area is beautiful to swim and snorkel. Did not come in contact with the resort visitors. The area very nice for tour groups.
g147342,d149221,February 21 2016,
g147342,d149221,February 21 2016,The setting here is gorgeous and the snorkeling is amazing. It's definitely worth a visit. Snorkel gear is available for rental. Be sure to wear or pack water shoes; the beach at the snorkeling area is extremely rocky and it is very difficult (and painful) to enter the water with bare feet.

g147342,d149221,February 21 2016,We stopped here and walked the small beach. Just to say we were there and put our feet in the Carribean Sea.Our guideVicky gave us some information about the hotel. Getting there was a trip. Can't believe all the hairpin turns on the roads. Not just there but throughout the Island.
g147342,d149221,February 21 2016,Beach is well manicured clean. There is nice restaurant nearby run by Viceroy Resort. Clean and snoby...
g147342,d149221,February 21 2016,The darkest cleast water for snorkeling I have ever seen. It was a darker color but seriously crystal clear and the sand was really comfortable underneath too. We took a short break here but it was really fun!
g147342,d149221,February 21 2016,We went here as part of a tour - the snorkeling was really good and you can use the sunbeds to the left of the beach for free. Very pretty
g147342,d149221,February 21 2016,Super snorkeling at end of beach - you can sit on chairs next to snorkeling area free of charge (some shade available there also). Most of main beach (with its fancy chairs and umbrellas) however is restricted to resort clients - so just sit near snorkeling area.
g147342,d149221,February 21 2016,Beautiful clean beach with an area to snorkel. Water Taxi available for @ 70.00$ -100$ round trip make sure you haggle the price or share the ride with others.
g147342,d149221,February 21 2016,
g147342,d149221,February 21 2016,Great snorkeling even better views. We saw this on Cosol Tours via a water taxi which made the visit to this beach even better.

g147342,d149221,February 21 2016,Beautiful picturesque beach with wonderful snorkeling. It is set just between the pitons with a view of each. Absolutely breathtaking.
g147342,d149221,February 21 2016,We stayed at ladera resort and they provide free shuttle to this beach. Beach is very small. The water is calm and refreshing but wear water shoes as it is a bit rocky don't step on a sea urchin. This is also where boats come to pick up people going out on day trips.
g147342,d149221,February 21 2016,
g147342,d149221,February 21 2016,
g147342,d149221,February 21 2016,You park up from the beach and one of the Viceroy's shuttles takes you down to the beach. The food at the beach is very very expensive so bring your own. They have all the water activities that someone could want. The beach is unreal as it's positioned right between the 2 pitons (volcano tops you see in photos)
g147342,d149221,February 21 2016,
g147342,d149221,February 21 2016,
g147342,d149221,February 21 2016,we took the family snorkeling here and the road to the beach was long and bumpy. they allowed boats to come right up to the shore and you had to wade through them to get to the snorkeling location. It was scary at times to see how close the motors came to swimmers

g147342,d149221,February 21 2016,
g147342,d149221,February 21 2016,Between the Pitons. We stopped to snorkel after climbing the Gros Piton. They let you park and then you can walk down to the beach. Snorkeling was good but not fabulous--is to the right at the very base of the Petit Piton.

g147342,d149529,March 10 2016,Beautiful view of the island immersion in the rain forest thrill on the zip lines hike of moderate difficulty and breathtaking views of the canopy. Couldn't fault it !
g147342,d149529,March 7 2016,We had visited the rainforest canopy cable car in March 2015. It was very humid and sporadically rained whilst we were there. The plants and wildlife were beautiful and well worth a visit.
g147342,d149529,March 7 2016,My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed both the tram and our guide. It was of the most relaxing things we did on our recent cruise. The view is spectacular. I was wearing a bright red shirt and had hummingbirds attacking me. Wear red! Even if you are afraid of heights as I am there us really no problem.

g147342,d149529,February 28 2016,
g147342,d149529,February 26 2016,Taking a gondola tour through and above the rain forest was both fascinating and breath-taking. We had a guide who described the foliage and wild life as we floated through several layers of the lush trees. There was also zip lining and hiking available for those younger and hardier than we are.
g147342,d149529,February 25 2016,
g147342,d149529,February 21 2016,So so beautiful! The leaves are gigantic and the colors are beautiful. Worth a visit. If your there definitely check out the a treetop zip lining.

g147342,d149615,February 21 2016,We took a tour and arrived at beautiful Sugar Beach on a water taxi. The water was warm and clear. Snorkeling was awesome! The view of the Pitons was absolutely breath taking. It is definitely a must see!
g147342,d149615,February 21 2016,
g147342,d149615,February 21 2016,You go to St Lucia to see The Pitons !!! We had different excursions (by hire car) and saw different views of The Pitons. A lovely Island and beaches and fantastic views - and sunsets.
g147342,d149615,February 21 2016,Love the snorkeling in the crystal clear blue waters. seeing the different species of fish and a little water snake. Thank god the wife didn't see that one. The corals were absolutely beautiful as well.
g147342,d149615,February 21 2016,The bay along Sugar Beach is one of world's most beautiful water paradises. Snorkeling is amazing as is the views of the Gros and Petite Piton and rain forest. The water is calm warm and has an ever changing array of colors from turquoise to emerald to all shades of bluez

g147342,d150064,February 20 2016,Anse Chastanet Beach is one of the more beautifull beaches on St.Lucia. Great setting and good snorkling. Beach chair an umbrella hire is very expensive as is the nearby restaurant part of a resort. So bring your own gear if possible. Bumpy road down to the beach but plenty of parking places around.
g147342,d150064,February 15 2016,Best of the snorkeling was had here. We've also snorkeled USVI St. John. This snorkeling does not match the clarity of St. John but we saw a host of different wildlife and greatly enjoyed our time. The water is cooler in St. Lucia than in the USVI but still warm and lovely.

g147342,d150064,February 15 2016,Excellent snorkeling right off the beach but the area can be quite crowded in peak holiday seasons. Tiki huts available for Anse Chastanet and Jade mountain guests are available for rental to those not staying at the resorts.

g147342,d150064,March 2 2016,Just north of Petite Piton and up from sugar Beach the snorkeling is incredible here. Of course the Caribbean waters are always warm and gentle (except during hurricanes) so the assortment of undersea life is amazing.
g147342,d150064,March 2 2016,
g147342,d150064,March 2 2016,ok we did do a round of snorkelling but this was ok nothing spectacular either. I Forgot - the Road to Anse C Beach this was truly exceptional in repair and steepness!!!
g147342,d150064,March 2 2016,Honeymoon destination - disappointing. Never really got feeling staff cared about us as individual human beings. Room was beautifully situated with view to Pitons but mosquito infested. Food OK not outstanding. Lots of scuba enthusiasts.

g147342,d150064,March 2 2016,All I can say is it was a world class beach and a pretty darn good shore dive on the reef and also excellent for snorkeling. The services for diving were excellent. I did not stay at the resort way out of my budget but it also appeared world class. You won't be disappointed.

g147342,d150512,March 10 2016,Worth the drive which is not a straight line road! Absolutely stunning natural beauty and history. Highly recommend. The backdrop of the Caribbean Is breathtaking. Great local history to be learned about the area.

g147342,d150512,March 5 2016,
g147342,d150512,March 5 2016,An amazing sight to think that the Pitons were formed by a gigantic volcano eruption on the island. Just magnificent to look at. We were told one could be climbed but the other not safe.

We were required to pay cash - having been told they did not accept credit cards. Given they were based on the airport that struck me as odd - but it seemed to be a St Lucia theme.

g147342,d313421,March 9 2016,Really enjoyed this tour we arrived ourselves drove in and a lady gave us a great tour that was really informative about the volcanic region really enjoyed it she was very knowledgeable. After we climbed into the mud baths which was also a lot of fun
g147342,d313421,March 9 2016,We did this a part of the Joe Knows tour and it was a lot of fun. The only disappointing thing is that there isn't and actual mud bath. They put mud in a bucket and your tour group uses the bucket to slather it on. Overall though it was a fun experience.
g147342,d313421,March 2 2016,The guides are very good and the place is somewhere you should visit if you get the chance you will encounter a few steps and the smell is pretty rank but to see the volcano which is still active is something special.
g147342,d313421,March 1 2016,Had a really friendly tour guide who let us go at our own pace (rather slowly due to disability) and was very knowledgeable about the volcano and its history. The only downside was the smoking springs werent all that impressive to look at.
g147342,d313421,February 26 2016,Amazing experience being inside the active volcano. The sulphur baths and mud baths are good fun> Great local guides and very knowledgeable .
g147342,d313421,February 24 2016,Really interesting if rather smelly visit. The National Park is well organised with good guides and a well laid out visitor trail. There are a lot of steps but the view of the volcano and the surrounding area makes the effort well worth while.
g147342,d313421,February 21 2016,It's not a drive- in volcano. Rather you drive into the parking lot and walk up stairs to see it. Pretty cool if you like geology.
g147342,d313421,February 19 2016,The so called vulcano is part of the attraction wich also includes the hot spring and mud bath. Not that spectacular but stil wort a visit. Go early to avoid the cruiseship mobs. Interesting museum. A guide is pushed but not necessairy.

g147343,d1440456,February 21 2016,We went on the tour to climb the grand piton at St. Lucia. Larry was our driver and he was wonderful! He explained a lot of what we saw and cut a coconut and a cocoa pod for us to eat. He made a great experience even better!
g147343,d1440456,February 10 2016,
g147343,d1440456,February 9 2016,
g147343,d1440456,February 9 2016,Big Larry is the best. He was very knowledgeable and entertaining. Hike was pretty tough but the view was spectacular. We made it to the top in record time.
g147343,d1440456,February 9 2016,
g147343,d1440456,February 9 2016,Richard was our driver for the Gros Piton hike. He took excellent care of us consistently going above and beyond to ensure that we were comfortable. Absolutely an amazing experience and Richard was a huge part of that. Thank you Richard and thank you St. Lucia for being exceptional for our honeymoon.

g147343,d149064,March 10 2016,This bay has a wonderful harbor with tons of restaurants and bars along the water. Beautiful surroundings...
g147343,d149064,March 9 2016,We were anchored here for a week secure easy place to be but very little charm or character. A guy came around the bay with fruit and veg in a little boat which was charming but his prices were very high
g147343,d149064,March 9 2016,This is a great area to spend an afternoon and wander around. There are some really interesting things to see here.
g147343,d149064,March 6 2016,Would like to highly recommend Spencer who has a Gazebo on the beach by the Papillon Hotel Reduit beach Rodney Bay. He was very professional in a lovely setting his prices are very reasonable too which is always a bonus. Well done Spencer
g147343,d149064,March 5 2016,
g147343,d149064,March 5 2016,This beach is beautiful sea crystal clear. There are all sorts of water activities and water taxis Well worth a visit

g147343,d149347,March 9 2016,
g147343,d149347,March 9 2016,We were able to attend a mass at this church and it was beautiful. The open air design of the church and the people inside it made it a truly unique experience.
g147343,d149347,March 8 2016,try to visit on Sunday and listen to Mass - even if you don't stay for the full service. you will find a full house and lots of beautifully dressed children and the singing is wonderful.
g147343,d149347,March 6 2016,Can be easily walked to from a cruise ship. Lovely church with great murals on the inside that depict a broad range of topics. The openness of it and the architecture tells you that you're in the Caribbean.
g147343,d149347,March 5 2016,A Catholic church with interesting fresco's around the walls and a wooden beamed ceiling. Worth visiting whilst shopping in Castries.
g147343,d149347,March 3 2016,Beautiful historic church in the center of town. Lots of charm. Common choice for weddings. If you're attending a mass be sure to have your shoulders covered or bring a shawl with you. It can get very hot though although they have some fans but you may want to bring a paper fan or parasol with you.
g147343,d149347,February 23 2016,the ceiling and side walls have unbelievable original local very high quality art work that deserves restoring and preservation sadly there is deterioration and some damage to a few wall murals while the overall structure seems very sound and reliable {as in" she has good bones but the skin is deteriorating").
g147343,d149347,February 20 2016,Nice open and interesting church worth a visit. Nice square bearby and other sites on walking distance. Parking can be difficult asit is right at the centre of the busy town and some Streets can feel a little bit unsafe so take care.
g147343,d149347,February 14 2016,
g147343,d149347,February 9 2016,My wife and I attended mass here a few Sundays ago. The church itself is spacious and welcoming. These St Lucians are people of great faith to be sure. The choir was wonderful and the service in English. A wonderful cultural experience.

g147344,d546321,March 10 2016,
g147344,d546321,March 8 2016,You really have to do this! ITs Amazing. You have to sample everything 'local' and this is not to be missed.
g147344,d546321,March 7 2016,I do love the Street Party good Musicgood Fish and Piton Beer. You will meet lots of Local sbut also lots of Tourist diffrent Ages.
g147344,d546321,March 6 2016,It wasn't a great feeling very busy and one for the youngsters! we didn't stay long but was glad I suppose to have experienced it
g147344,d546321,March 6 2016,
g147344,d546321,March 3 2016,
g147344,d546321,March 3 2016,As always the Friday Night Street party did not disappointment me. Good food music and dancing. A must do when you visit St. Lucia.!
g147344,d546321,March 1 2016,We enjoyed the street party food drink and hanging out! We had connected with a taxi guy who ensured he picked us up at a designated location and time.
g147344,d546321,March 1 2016,
g147344,d546321,March 1 2016,Went for the adventure and to experience the true St Lucian nightlife. Enjoyed lobster dinner at a local eatery and several cocktails
g147345,d149085,March 4 2016,
g147345,d149085,March 6 2016,
g147345,d149085,March 4 2016,We loved this little beach. You get there by walking 7 minutes from Anse Chastanet. There is really good snorkeling at the far end of the beach (although fairly strong current) and we loved eating on the beach.
g147345,d149085,March 3 2016,Arrive by launch from Soufriere and get lost on this strip of beach. Delicious food on the charcoal grill and a bar with excellent drinks. Gobs of privacy.
g147345,d149085,February 29 2016,Very nice beach with a small bar and restaurant. We walked there from Soufrière. The walk took us about 40min and had a lot of photo opportunities. Hamburger was tasty but rather overpriced at 24US$.
g147345,d149085,February 24 2016,
g147345,d149085,February 17 2016,
g147345,d149085,February 11 2016,
g147345,d149085,February 9 2016,Worth the walk from Anse Chastenet. Enjoyed that famous burger and spent most of the afternoon here sunning and snorkeling.

g147345,d149220,March 7 2016,
g147345,d149220,March 10 2016,Well worth a visit not only do you get to see a live volcano you also get to have a dip in the roasting hot springs and cover yourself in volcanic mud! Great fun fab trip 😀
g147345,d149220,March 10 2016,Plenty more things to see on St. Lucia before going there. Really moderate interest. Luckily it was part of a wider tour that was a lot more interesting!
g147345,d149220,March 9 2016,
g147345,d149220,March 8 2016,

g147345,d149220,March 7 2016,
g147345,d149220,March 7 2016,The tour guide was very knowledgeable and had answers for every questions. lots of information. well worth the trip.
g147345,d149220,March 6 2016,A stop at the Sulphur Springs was part of a tour we booked. Very fun but be forewarned - the water is VERY hot and takes some getting used to. The mud bath made my skin feel like velvet and that's worth a trip!
g147345,d149220,March 6 2016,We went with another couple and our guide Charlie (Tours) and enjoyed learning the history of the sulphur springs and our mud bath in the natural hot springs. Unique and fun experience great for families.
g147345,d149220,March 5 2016,mud bath was worth it. how often do you get to cover yourself in mud from a volcanic fault. waterfall was cool but refreshing and got all the mud residue off.
g147345,d149850,March 2 2016,
g147345,d149850,March 8 2016,The waterfall was beautiful. Make sure to arrive early so you are able to take photos and are not bothered by a tour.
g147345,d149850,March 4 2016,Very tiny and can hardly be described as an attraction. Where I live this would be considered runoff from a storm.
g147345,d149850,March 2 2016,Found at the top of the Botanical Gardens and is only a short walk to take a few nice photos not somewhere to spend the day.
g147345,d149850,February 21 2016,This was very relaxing activity in a serene environment. The gentleman in charge was very accommodating though we late.
g147345,d149850,February 21 2016,Pretty waterfall stop immediately following Sulphur Springs! Good place to wash up after going to Sulphur Springs and offers opportunity for beautiful pictures.
g147345,d149850,February 20 2016,Just another waterfall. There are more interesting sites on St.Lucia noit worth a detour but you can visit in when being around.
g147345,d149850,February 16 2016,I went to the water fall last week with my adult kids it was tiny and very crowded not very impressive considering we took a boat to get there and then a bus. Better to hike the Pitons was not very impressive.
g147345,d149850,February 15 2016,
g147345,d149850,February 10 2016,Great place to wash of the residual of the volcano mud we put on ealier in the day. The falls were really cool and cold. Everyone who went in enjoyed them. This is a don't miss.
g147345,d149850,February 9 2016,
g147345,d2075601,March 9 2016,
g147345,d2075601,March 10 2016,A 45 minute walk round trip. Pretty views we are seniors and the walk is not hard if you are at all active. It's an ok activity not spectacle.
g147345,d2075601,March 9 2016,Great scenic views of the Pitons on the trail. Easy to walk the trail most people can do it but some climbing is required. There is an entrance fee of USD 10.
g147345,d2075601,March 6 2016,This was the highlight of our trip to the Soufriere area on St Lucia. A little climbing involved but do-able for most. This is a must for its awe-inspiring views of the Pitons. Our guide was very informative and pleasant.
g147345,d2075601,March 6 2016,Beautiful views not strenuous a great guide. A wonderful alternative if you don't have the energy to climb the Pitons. Don't miss it!
g147345,d2075601,March 5 2016,
g147345,d2075601,March 1 2016,Tet Paul was a great way to spend an hour. We were lucky to have our tour guide Denver to ourselves and enjoyed a lovely walk as he shared his knowledge and passion for where he lived. Wonderful flowers and plants and amazing views of the Pitons
g147345,d2075601,February 29 2016,
g147345,d2075601,February 28 2016,
g147345,d2075601,February 28 2016,What an amazing view of the Pitons! This was a very easy guided walk that took about 30 minutes. The views of the southern part of St. Lucia were beautiful. What a great spot!
g147345,d2075601,February 28 2016,We did this our first day on the island. Great little trail (about 45 mins) to get a feel for the vegetation and stretch your legs. Great view of the Pitons without having to hike them!
g147345,d313420,March 10 2016,
g147345,d313420,March 10 2016,Enjoyed a quiet walk through the gardens. The waterfall is unique because the minerals in the water create beautiful colors on the walls behind it.
g147345,d313420,March 10 2016,
g147345,d313420,March 9 2016,It was about a 35 minute stroll. Saw some plants In flower that I have never seen . Plants and trees are well labelled .
g147345,d313420,March 8 2016,Beautiful garden. I didn't opt for a tour guide but all the plants are labeled. Beautiful grounds. The waterfall is lovely. We went early and only had one other couple there at the same time. Didn't bother with the mineral bath as it didn't look too inviting. Only one bath was open at the time.
g147345,d313420,March 5 2016,
g147345,d313420,March 5 2016,quite a range of transplanted and local trees and flowers capped by mineral baths and a lovely waterfall
g147345,d313420,March 4 2016,
g147345,d313420,March 2 2016,Endless trees shrubs plants and flowers. Follow the trail and all the information is there for you to see we had our guide and she was very good too. The waterfall at the top is fab and worth the short walk you have shops on site so give it a go.
g147345,d313420,March 2 2016,If you are in the Soufriere area this is a must as are the mud baths. Lots of beautiful plants that are labeled and you can stroll at your leisure
g147345,d313420,March 2 2016,Nice gardens easy to get around . Large selection of plants . The water fall is beautiful. Has hot baths and a small shop for refreshments.

g147365,d1006098,February 26 2016,
g147365,d1006098,February 22 2016,We were in Grand Cayman for 5 days and I cannot imagine our trip without this 4 hour jet ski excursion. We brought our 5 7 and 10 year old kids and took two jet skis and we had an AMAZING time! CJ and Craig are just wonderful! Will be back again as soon as we can! :)
g147365,d1006098,February 21 2016,This is the second time we used fat fish. We had a great time. The only thing that we missed this time over the last time was the conversation with the guides. Otherwise great fun. Stingray city on jet skis is the only way to go.
g147365,d1006098,February 18 2016,
g147365,d1006098,February 14 2016,Peter was very helpful and knowledgable about the area. He was flexible with our schedule and made sure we had what we needed.

g147365,d148101,March 9 2016,
g147365,d148101,March 9 2016,This was my husband's favorite part of our trip. Everyone should take this tour to learn about the history of the Cayman Islands. Interesting presented well clean facilities and clean restrooms. Highly recommended.
g147365,d148101,March 9 2016,We really enjoyed this site. We had an excellent tour guide and the ladies in the gift store were very friendly as was all staff we came across while there. This is an interesting place and the tour was very informative.

g147365,d148101,February 29 2016,These folks have a very professional presentation on the history of the Caymans. After the show you are guided through the home whit is beautifully furnished. The grounds are a loely place to contemplate life on the island in the "good old days!"
g147365,d148101,February 29 2016,A little history lesson before walking the grounds. It's not a very large estate but the rebuilt house is beautiful. I've never seen so much mahogany in one place before.
g147365,d148101,February 28 2016,We loved the guide and his island modesty. He explained the history and reason behind all the features of the house. We had so many questions that he calmly and clearly answered. The gift shop is priced very reasonable and the short movie very well done in an reproduction setting
g147365,d148101,February 25 2016,We really enjoyed our time at Pedro St. James. Wonderful tour and movies about the Cayman Islands and Pedro St James. First class history lesson.
g147365,d148101,February 24 2016,
g147365,d148101,February 24 2016,We did this as part of an all day tour around the island. It was interesting but not overly exciting. I would recommend doing this only if you have several days on the island. There are many things to see and do so this should only be done if you have time to spare or are a history buff.
g147365,d148102,March 10 2016,
g147365,d148102,March 10 2016,Not your typical botanical garden stocked with flowers but an exhibit of a huge variety of local plants of all kinds. Also saw a couple of parrots and a few turtles and iguanas near the lake.
g147365,d148102,March 10 2016,
g147365,d148102,March 9 2016,First we were surprised by a sudden downpour which quickly passed. The park is beautifully maintained and worth the visit! Highly recommended!
g147365,d148102,March 9 2016,
g147365,d148102,March 9 2016,We visited the gardens on our first day in the islands. There was an orchid show and we are horticulturists that love growing orchids. the gardens have several interesting areas that are delightful to stroll through and of great interest if you are a plant person. We saw the blue iguanas and Cayman parrots.

g147365,d148102,March 5 2016,
g147365,d148102,March 4 2016,Take a beautiful walk through the forest and blooming gardens see rare blue iguanas colorful parrots herons and many other tropical birds.

g147365,d149242,March 5 2016,
g147365,d149242,March 4 2016,Great location to go and visit for the day! The waters are breath taking. The Mudsilde drink is a must try at Rum Point. Happy Happy!
g147365,d149242,March 3 2016,We went to rum point for a few hours during our stay in Cayman Kai. It was a good place to get souvenirs. We walked on the dock and saw quite a few fish. We ate lunch at the wreck bar. It was tasty and good service. We stevatbthevrum point restaurant on a different evening and it was good too.
g147365,d149242,March 3 2016,
g147365,d149242,March 2 2016,
g147365,d149242,February 29 2016,Great place to stop for a drink and something to eat. There's a rental shop to get what you need to enjoy the water.
g147365,d149242,February 29 2016,So rum point beach is a great location. Peaceful clean and beautiful. It's a beautiful spot to sunbathe eat and do water sports. Great place to visit and a must when in Cayman.
g147365,d149252,March 9 2016,
g147365,d149252,March 9 2016,Smith Cove has a nice beach with plenty of shade. The coast here is beautiful with a lot of tidal pools to explore. We especially enjoyed snorkeling the sides of the cove and the coral heads just outside of it. We also saw a few baptisms while we were here.
g147365,d149252,March 9 2016,Small Cove that few are aware of ... beyond gorgeous. Interesting variety of sand and iron shore. I visit Smith Cove often to chill and walk along the Iron shore area ... must keep alert since the iron shore is not a good place to take a fall.
g147365,d149252,March 9 2016,We are staying within walking distance. Have gone several times even for just an hour. Nice beach! Plan to go snorkeling here too.
g147365,d149252,March 8 2016,A great place that locals like but not well known to tourists. It's a small beach but lovely & clear. Our running group ended here and it was a fabulous quiet are to relax for part of the afternoon.
g147365,d149252,March 8 2016,Smith Cove is a nice spot to relax. But there will be others there. Shower and bathrooms are a bonus. Nice snorkeling. Great spot for kids. Go on a day with no cruise ships in port. Either way still a fun spot. It's never over crowded.
g147365,d149252,March 5 2016,The beach is great and there are plenty of trees. Beware of the chickens. Too many chickens is the only complaint I have for this beach. There's a restroom and fresh water shower. Best location for sunsets!
g147365,d149252,March 4 2016,Sweet lovely cove with very easy snorkeling for any age. There was a wedding in progress when we were there so a bit crowded. Pretty public beach and gradual easy water entry to swim.
g147365,d149252,March 3 2016,We stopped at numerous roadside beaches to try snorkeling and this was just about the best of those we tried. There is easy access to the water and several rock formations to snorkel around. The only negative is that there are no tables or seating at this park.
g147365,d149252,February 29 2016,This spot offers showers and bathrooms and natural shade. The snorkling is easy but there are not too many varieties of fish to see. A nice place to enjoy an afternoon.
g147365,d149252,February 28 2016,

g147365,d149253,March 7 2016,
g147365,d149253,March 5 2016,Mr. Alan is the unofficial tour guide for this area. He had a lot of history and interesting facts regarding the area. He does this as a volunteer and we tipped him $5 USD. Well worth the stop.
g147365,d149253,March 2 2016,The highway markings for this attraction are not very prominently displayed but we turned around and went back to get some pictures. You don't even have to be there on a super windy day to get some good shots.
g147365,d149253,March 1 2016,Need a car or tour to get here as is bit of a drive from Georgetown. Just a pullout alongside the road but when there are waves rolling in the spray is quite cool to watch.
g147365,d149253,February 29 2016,Our guide Allen gave us a full geophysical history of the island and even took our picture as the spray erupted from the blow hole. A charming way to become acquainted with a Cayman gentleman and the history of the island.
g147365,d149253,February 28 2016,The blow holes are only part of fun. There we met a local man Alan who gave us a tour of the blow holes and showed us many fossils in the coral. He is a look a like for president Obama and will pose in pictures with you if you ask. We recommend tipping him
g147365,d149253,February 26 2016,The day we were there the winds were perfect and the hole was blowing !! Don't make a special trip but it's a neat diversion.
g147365,d149253,February 25 2016,
g147365,d149253,February 24 2016,
g147365,d149652,March 6 2016,
g147365,d149652,March 6 2016,Nice hike. We did not do the entire trail due to timing but walked for total time of about 90 minutes. We saw several Cayman green parrots and other birds. Some interesting vegetation and coral deposits. It was the last week in February. There was mud only in a few spots and was easy to get around.
g147365,d149652,February 27 2016,
g147365,d149652,February 24 2016,Did not now what to expect was offered a guided tour but we found a North side entrance and just went on our own. A bit of a harder hike than expected and definatly longer than the 2 miles each way as stated but worth it. Seen a lot of wild Parrots. Very peaceful and not crowded at all. Lovely
g147365,d149652,February 19 2016,
g147365,d149652,February 18 2016,
g147365,d149652,February 15 2016,Bring your hiking boots or a pair of shoes that can be dirtied. Many portions of the trail were muddy and wet. It is an amazing must see nature part of the Island. Free and self guided.
g147365,d149652,February 13 2016,
g147365,d149652,February 11 2016,
g147365,d149652,February 11 2016,This hike is hard. But totally worth it. Lots of great things to see: wild snakes hermit crabs parrots and other birds. Make sure to go on a cloudy day and bring lots of water. And the trail can get muddy at times. So good hiking boots are a must.
g147365,d149652,February 9 2016,
g147365,d1738429,March 9 2016,
g147365,d1738429,March 9 2016,Water is calm in this area. Went several times. Always saw starfish. You have to be careful with them. Not a super busy beach. We went during the week.
g147365,d1738429,March 9 2016,Wanted to see the red starfish and so we specifically chose to take the Cayman Eco Tour so that we could have the experience. The sandy waters let you walk among them. a grat experience.
g147365,d1738429,March 8 2016,Saw about 15 starfish ... Really beautiful. They are orangish. Try to not take them out of the water as they can die off. Hard to find this place and it's not marked. Our gps took us there though and we guessed as to where the spot was. No bathrooms or anything.
g147365,d1738429,March 7 2016,
g147365,d1738429,March 6 2016,Over the years the number of starfish have decresed because of tourists and tour companies. If a starfish is out of the water for 20 seconds it will die! Its a beautiful place and I'm thankful to have seen it! But please respect the beautiful creatures!
g147365,d1738429,March 5 2016,This beach was not easy to find the signage is not visible however when we did eventually find it we were amazed by all the starfish and other beautiful fish we saw in the water including a stingray. Would recommend a visit there.
g147365,d1738429,March 3 2016,We went to starfish point ventured past the no trespassing sign. We saw some lizards on the walk in. Once we got there we saw one starfish. There were three tour boats there and people were snorkelling but we saw more starfish on our beach at kaibo Kai than on starfish point. Maybe we just picked an off day.
g147365,d1738429,March 2 2016,
g147365,d1738429,March 2 2016,We had a great time. Lots of starfish. Snorkeling out was fun with the kids. The bigger starfish seem to like the grass. Overall it's a good stop on the island.
g147365,d1738429,March 1 2016,
g147365,d1897922,February 28 2016,
g147365,d1897922,February 28 2016,Visited Beach Bubbles in Bodden Town during our vacation to the Caymen Islands in July of 2015. Met Nina who was fascinating to talk to and very friendly. Have since ordered two shipments of the soap online and have been thoroughly pleased every time.
g147365,d1897922,February 24 2016,
g147365,d1897922,February 23 2016,
g147365,d1897922,February 23 2016,
g147365,d1897922,February 23 2016,
g147365,d1897922,February 23 2016,Stopped in and checked out the store. The products that beach bubbles has are beyond amazing. I have rosacea and purchased one of her products and it has helped me tremendously. I would highly recommend this shock to anyone.
g147365,d1897922,February 23 2016,
g147365,d1897922,February 23 2016,
g147365,d1897922,February 23 2016,The owner helped me with natural products to get relief from the mosquito bites. She directed me to a soap and a cream to treat the bites and deter additional bites. These products were made from an indigenous neem plant from off the island. These products were a life saver and made the rest of my trip tolerable.
g147365,d1897922,February 23 2016,Owner spent time explaining everything to us but not pushy in any way. Allowed us to switch out some of her two pack items when we couldn't find the exact two items already packaged. Haven't used the soap but a great shopping experience.
g147365,d2198364,March 10 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 10 2016,We booked it through our cruise. The guides were all nice. My group had a blast. They pick you up from port drive you to their boat and they take you out to a beautiful sand bar and you feed the stingrays. I took my GoPro and go some amazing photos.
g147365,d2198364,March 9 2016,We visited Stingray City during a recent family vacation our group of 11 ranged in age from 5 to 50 and everyone had a great time. We would definitely recommend Soto's Cruises; the group size was much smaller than others and the crew was excellent great value for $40 pp. Try to visit on a calm day.
g147365,d2198364,March 9 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 9 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 9 2016,Our last day on the island was spent on the water. We booked with Cayman Eco Adventures and had a great trip. We chose this vendor because we wanted to not only see the stingrays but also the red starfish. did a little snorkeling as well. Good hosts and a perfect end to a great week on the island.
g147365,d2198364,March 9 2016,This was a great stop on our tour. Our guide took us to the far end of the sandbar and were instantly surrounded by stingrays. We loved feeding and holding them it was so amazing. Our guild was great and kept us away from the big crowds at the other end of the sand bar.
g147365,d2198364,March 8 2016,Incredible experience! A must do in Grand Cayman! The stingrays are gentle and come right up when a new boat arrives. The water is shallow & clear.
g147365,d2198364,March 8 2016,I was amazed by Romance of the Seas captain and his crew. Very knowledgeable and it was such an adventure. Be careful if you get sea sick since the boat will rock under the waves. And getting on/off the boat can be tricky.
g147365,d2198364,March 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 8 2016,If you go to the Cayman Islands there's nothing better then to feed the Stingrays even hold one. Take the Cayman Island Sailing Charter for a personal once in a life time experience.
g147365,d2198364,March 6 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 7 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 6 2016,This is an awesome experience that you should not miss if you're going to be in Grand Cayman. Please see my review of Moby Dick Tours for a more in-depth review.
g147365,d2198364,March 6 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 6 2016,One of the best experiences of my life the stingrays are right below you and free in their natural habitat. The 20 min boat ride was great and you can go snorkeling around there too. A must!
g147365,d2198364,March 6 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 5 2016,What else can be said that hasn't already been said? This is one of the essential trips everyone must do when visiting Grand Cayman These beautiful creatures are so wonderful okay so they get fed but it is a truly wonderful experience. Five stars..!
g147365,d2198364,March 5 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 5 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 5 2016,Take Six Senses Tour for Sting Ray City. It was a great experience and an outstanding day! No place like it anywhere else that I've ever been even in Hawaii. Nothing like it!
g147365,d2198364,March 5 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 5 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 5 2016,One of our favorite experiences during the trip. Water was a little rough would have been better with calm winds. Very cool for whole family.
g147365,d2198364,March 4 2016,This is my favorite excursion in Grand Cayman! The stingrays are absolutely gorgeous creatures and very friendly. I plan to go everything I'm there.
g147365,d2198364,March 3 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 3 2016,A must if visiting Grand Cayman. Feeding and swimming with these beautiful gentle creatures is an adventure and memory you'll cherish. If you want see them without the crowds book a sunrise tour. Worth the early alarm.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Not very impressed with this excursion. Not worth the money. The pictures are overpriced. Although you can take your own pictures if you have a waterproof camera. Wouldn't do this again. I'd rather go snorkeling.
g147365,d2198364,February 29 2016,Our tour with Six Senses Eco Tour included a stop here and it was fascinating. Shallow water easy to stand in and easy to feed or touch the sting rays. The Sting Rays were friendly but not aggressive.
g147365,d2198364,February 29 2016,If you find yourself on Grand Cayman definitely make the trip out to Stingray City. We went with Moby Dick Tours and were not disappointed. Smaller groups and great owner/leaders.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,This was my third time there and really enjoyed this time due to perfect weather with a fairly small crowd. There were no cruise ships in town the day we went.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Good fun for the entire family. Everyone knows about Sting Ray City for good reason. Even for accomplished divers it is worth it.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,You have to try it. My review will not do justice to the experience. Standing on the sandbar with 1 foot to 4 foot stingrays eating from your hand is incredible.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,The sting rays come right up to you in shallow water and you can feed them. They are very soft to pet. The guides explain a lot about them and it's a really fun time.
g147365,d2198364,February 26 2016,fun experience for the entire family....you to old! most visitors are friendly and friendly. over crowded at times. Plan a trip with a reputable tour company.
g147365,d2198364,February 26 2016,Really cool to have the stingrays swim around you. Most amazing water I have ever seen/been in. Guide was informative and was cool to hold/kiss the stingray. Only negative is lots of people and interaction very short as you're waiting for other people in your huge group to have a turn.
g147365,d2198364,February 26 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 26 2016,Great day with a boat tour placed us on a sand bar where all but the smallest children can stand. The sting ray are soft friendly and constantly coming back for more contact. The guide said they felt like portobello mushrooms... They did. We held them the kids kissed them and it was just great!

g147365,d2198364,February 26 2016,Tour guides were great. The water was perfect on temperature and clarity. The sting rays were in the area and our guides were able to catch one and show us the ray. They are amazing animals. Changed our opinion of the animal.
g147365,d2198364,February 25 2016,Wonderful experience interacting and feeding the sting rays! The crew was awesome as well! Must visit!!! They took time telling about the sting rays and even found a starfish for us to look at.
g147365,d2198364,February 25 2016,We had been other places to swim with the stingrays they were fenced in so to speak and were a captive audience but here they were wild and free. It was amazing to see them arrive and swim past come up to you and investigate you as you did them. Worth the money.

g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,This is a tourist attraction that everyone who visits the Cayman Islands should take. I have taken all of my guests to stingray city and they all love it. The stingrays are docile and will eat out of your hand a real treat to both the tourist and the ray
g147365,d2198364,February 23 2016,We loved this experience very unique to be with nature in a beautiful environment. Ensure to book with time and ask the company for the best day to go based on weather so that you can enjoy when it's calm (too much wind causes water to be turbulent and limits visibility when snorkeling). Don't miss it!
g147365,d2198364,February 23 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 23 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 23 2016,It's a once in a lifetime experience. Beware however it's a bit overwhelming for small children. The stingrays are quite large and several of the children were scared and had to stay on the boat.
g147365,d2198364,February 23 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 23 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,Truly and unforgettable experience! Our guide knew the Rays by name! He found his favourites and brought them over for pictures with us and we all got to feed them squid too! After we went a little further off and enjoyed a bit of snorkeling too :)
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,Even though there was a lot of wind there were still plenty of stingrays to go around. They came right up to you looking for food or just checking you out. On a calm day I bet it's even better.
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,Rowan Watersports took us to this beautiful blue spot out in the ocean & it was littered with hundreds of stingrays in all sizes!! Captain Clayburn Allison & Dave were all professional courteous & fun!! We took our 20 & 24 yr old children they loved it!! Highlight of our cruise!!
g147365,d2198364,February 21 2016,This was amazing and so much fun!!!!! Would love to do this again if we are ever back on the island. We were able to feed and pet the stingrays. They are quite aggressive when squid is in the water but we were fully prepared and told this before we ever got in the water.
g147365,d2198364,February 21 2016,An amazing and unforgettable experience. Feed and swim among stingrays . An unique experience. A sandbar close to the coast full of singrays
g147365,d2198364,February 21 2016,what a great trip the water was so clear the men on our boat were so helpful my 2 grandsons were able to hold them - kiss them - and get a back massage and the crew took some great pictures.
g147365,d2198364,March 10 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 10 2016,We booked it through our cruise. The guides were all nice. My group had a blast. They pick you up from port drive you to their boat and they take you out to a beautiful sand bar and you feed the stingrays. I took my GoPro and go some amazing photos.
g147365,d2198364,March 9 2016,We visited Stingray City during a recent family vacation our group of 11 ranged in age from 5 to 50 and everyone had a great time. We would definitely recommend Soto's Cruises; the group size was much smaller than others and the crew was excellent great value for $40 pp. Try to visit on a calm day.
g147365,d2198364,March 9 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 9 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 9 2016,Our last day on the island was spent on the water. We booked with Cayman Eco Adventures and had a great trip. We chose this vendor because we wanted to not only see the stingrays but also the red starfish. did a little snorkeling as well. Good hosts and a perfect end to a great week on the island.
g147365,d2198364,March 9 2016,This was a great stop on our tour. Our guide took us to the far end of the sandbar and were instantly surrounded by stingrays. We loved feeding and holding them it was so amazing. Our guild was great and kept us away from the big crowds at the other end of the sand bar.
g147365,d2198364,March 8 2016,Incredible experience! A must do in Grand Cayman! The stingrays are gentle and come right up when a new boat arrives. The water is shallow & clear.
g147365,d2198364,March 8 2016,I was amazed by Romance of the Seas captain and his crew. Very knowledgeable and it was such an adventure. Be careful if you get sea sick since the boat will rock under the waves. And getting on/off the boat can be tricky.
g147365,d2198364,March 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 8 2016,If you go to the Cayman Islands there's nothing better then to feed the Stingrays even hold one. Take the Cayman Island Sailing Charter for a personal once in a life time experience.

g147365,d254117,March 4 2016,To enjoy the beautiful sand and turquoise water of 7 mile beach without the crowds and high rise buildings this is a glorious public beach with great snorkeling. There's parking along the road and plenty of shade.
g147365,d254117,March 1 2016,Have been to this quiet off the grid beach to snorkel nearly every time we have been to Cayman on cruises. It has no services but does have shade. Nearby grocery.
g147365,d254117,February 29 2016,There are no toilets or showers but plenty of shade trees and the snorkeling is terrific. About 20 feet off shore there are rocks and coral heads and plenty of fish. When you follow the grasses further out you get ot larger and even more varieties of fish.
g147365,d254117,February 28 2016,As all beaches on 7 mile this was easy to get to and a very quiet little area with plenty of shade and sun for your personal preference. Great snorkeling and swimming. There are no facilities or eateries close by....just beach and beautiful water. A nice getaway from any crowds.
g147365,d254117,February 24 2016,Extremely secluded and private with beautiful white sand calm waters and amazing areas to snorkel. Would 100% recommend going to this beach and the public buses are only $2 for any trip anywhere
g147365,d254117,February 23 2016,
g147365,d254117,February 21 2016,Have snorkeled Cemetery reef many times - very accessible and very nice snorkel spot on seven mile beach - always something new to see ...
g147365,d3140425,February 29 2016,
g147365,d3140425,March 9 2016,Pretty area but still in development. Pricey trendy shops. We went to the Farmer's Market & Craft Fair and were disappointed.
g147365,d3140425,March 9 2016,I used to work in one of the stores in Caymana Bay so I was there very often. I love the whole area! It is modern and clean. There are some great places to shop and eat.
g147365,d3140425,March 3 2016,We went to have lunch and go to the pandora store. We found it hard to find the mall from 7 mile and no stores to go into. We ate at the waterfront urban cafe which was good. Got our stuff st pandora and left.
g147365,d3140425,March 1 2016,Shopping eating people watching... what could be better. Had to bring my 22 daughter back to reality after seeing this she wants to move here. I don't think being a teacher here would pay enough to live there. She should of got her degree in business!!!
g147365,d3140425,March 1 2016,We spent a couple hours here for a local farmers market and went up in the observation tower for pics. Nice shops clean and places to eat with plenty of services.
g147365,d3140425,February 29 2016,We were able to walk here from the Comfort Suites on 7 Mile Beach. It is an eclectic collection of new buildings with retail on the street level and housing above. There are a wide variety of shoppes and eateries all beautifully laid out and landscaped. Don't miss seeing the future of Cayman.
g147365,d3140425,February 28 2016,This is basically a city within a city. A beautiful area full of shops residences restaurants and attractions. There is ongoing construction in the area but it on the opposite side of most of the site seeing.
g147365,d3140425,February 24 2016,We stopped at Camana Bay for a quick shopping trip. There were some nice stores and restaurants and the setting is very beautiful.
g147365,d3140425,February 23 2016,Great day trip from East End for a relaxing stroll some window shopping/retail therapy and great selection of restaurants (Ortanique was fantastic). DO NOT MISS THE OBSERVATORY. The mosaic walls are an outstanding work of art and the views are quite beautiful once you reach the top.
g147365,d3140425,February 23 2016,Camana Bay is a lifestyle center. Live work play. It offers excellent shopping a large cinema vast array of restaurants and a view of the bay. Several of the restaurants are child friendly.

g147365,d4586498,February 25 2016,I've been to palms a few times and love it. The weekdays are always busier with the cruises making stops so late afternoons and weekends are a bit more quiet but there's always something going on at palms. The food is delicious mixed drinks smoothies etc are also very good. Fun staff nice pool good music beautiful beach!
g147365,d4586498,February 23 2016,
g147365,d4586498,February 23 2016,Excellent food and cocktails at the beachside bar. The mahi sandwich is fresh and spicy. The mojito and margaritas are especially refreshing. The service is excellent but there is no rush. You can enjoy an afternoon of people watching.

g147365,d641547,March 4 2016,This is the second time we have booked with Moby Dick. Their boat is large enough to be comfortable but small enough that you are not with a group of 100 people. We saw other boats that were jam packed with people. Moby Dick Operators are awesome! They make sure you have a safe fun experience. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
g147365,d641547,February 29 2016,
g147365,d641547,February 24 2016,Moby Dick tours offered a Sting Ray City excursion for a great price. They offered great service warned us about potential weather problems and provided a fun afternoon.

g147365,d641547,February 23 2016,
g147365,d641547,February 18 2016,This had to be the best day of our 2 week cruise. Being able to hold and feed Stingrays was amazing.

g147366,d1017750,February 9 2016,Imagine you are Christopher Columbus and his crew onboard this majestic replica of ships in bygone eras of historical vital importance and heritage to these beautiful islands - A truly magical experience brilliantly presented for the thrill and enjoyment of both locals and international visitors - A Must Do for the Experience of a Lifetime

g147366,d1119772,February 20 2016,
g147366,d1119772,February 18 2016,On a recent cruise I visited the Cayman Islands Brewery. It was a very hot day and the beer certainly tasted good. The staff was friendly and informative. I would recommend this tour if you are ever in Georgetown. A fun time.
g147366,d1119772,February 16 2016,Fun tour of the brewery with explanations of the brewing process. Followed by sampling of their regular and craft brews. Enjoyable for beer lovers.
g147366,d1119772,February 11 2016,
g147366,d1119772,February 11 2016,Seantel was a great host and tour guide. We spent a couple hours just hanging out after every one else left. Good beer fun place.
g147366,d1119772,February 11 2016,Huge huge thanks to the guys here. Absolutely great tour. Very informative. Good fun and just great to see how behind the scenes work.
g147366,d1119772,February 11 2016,
g147366,d1119772,February 11 2016,
g147366,d1119772,February 11 2016,We had a day to visit Grand Cayman so chose the Cayman brewery. It was a cool small brewery which had a unique feel. The choice of beers was good and it was great to have a taste of a fresh can of White Shark Tip.
g147366,d148103,February 22 2016,
g147366,d148103,February 29 2016,
g147366,d148103,February 22 2016,Not sure why this is even listed. When you are walking around downtown Georgetown there is a cannon and what looks like a tree house. You can probably spend 30seconds if you go slow
g147366,d148103,February 8 2016,If you have a few minutes before returning to your hotel or cruise ship you might choose to visit this little corner. Fort George has a little history for one interested in the beginnings of the island.
g147366,d148103,February 8 2016,This flat island  in which tall buildings are banned  has few buildings of any architectural interest. Fort George is a small ruined fortbuilt in 1790 to repel the Spanish who invaded to capture locals to be sold into slavery in Cuba.
g147366,d148103,February 8 2016,There isn't much left of Fort George but what bit is left has been preserved. There are some walls and cannons and the area has been restored with information boards and wall murals to give an idea of what the fort was like in its day.
g147366,d148103,February 8 2016,
g147366,d148103,February 8 2016,We had a difficult time finding this site. Evenb a security guard across the street did not know it. It is a small area remains of a wall and a cannon. Yo can walk past it and not know you have been there
g147366,d148103,February 8 2016,Should not be listed on a walking tour. Interesting to read about but there is no fort left to see as it was totally demolished.
g147366,d148103,February 8 2016,There is nothing really there If you are in downtown Georgetown in about 30 seconds you can see this.
g147366,d148103,February 8 2016,
g147366,d148104,March 2 2016,
g147366,d148104,March 2 2016,I expect that this landmark is overlooked by many visitors to Grand Cayman but it is well worth spending an hour or so learning the history of this group of islands. Who knew that turtle hunting was once a major occupation on Cayman?
g147366,d148104,February 29 2016,This museum helped us understand the history of the Cayman Islands. The displays featured information about original settlers and historic events. There were several interactive exhibits which we found interesting. It is maintained very well and is located on the waterfront in Georgetown. Visiting will help you appreciate the Cayman Islands and their residents.
g147366,d148104,February 28 2016,This museum has good open hours of operation. Not a whole lot to this place. A great location not far from the cruise port.
g147366,d148104,February 28 2016,
g147366,d148104,February 21 2016,This is in a great location  on the harbour looks freshly decorated and very interesting <thankyou !
g147366,d148104,February 14 2016,
g147366,d148104,February 14 2016,The National Museum on the waterfront has an interestingcollection of exhibits of the natural and cultural history of the islands. Housed in a 150 year old former courthouse jail and post office this is a good place to start on a visit to the town from a cruise.
g147366,d148104,February 14 2016,Either the history of the Cayman Islands is dull or the museum lacks displays on the more interesting aspects of it....one would think there has been much drama here between slavery and the decision to stay with the Kingdom in 1969....no deep dive on either issue is on display here. You can see entire thing in under 40 minutes.
g147366,d148104,February 14 2016,
g147366,d148104,February 14 2016,
g147366,d148105,February 14 2016,
g147366,d148105,February 14 2016,I have to give this place the lowest ratings possible because we couldn't find it and couldn't find anyone who had ever heard of it not even the police or the workers at other museums. I would think that someone would have at least said "oh yeah that used to be over there" but we didn't even get that!
g147366,d148105,February 14 2016,Maps and Tales of Sunken ships and treasure abounds An educational and fun experience - Christopher Columbus and the Spanish Main Spanish Galleons Lost and Found and the treasures onboard This is the real thing - and will fill the eyes with wonder A really enjoyable attraction

g147366,d148539,February 28 2016,The lady who runs this centre is a true gem. She had a wealth of knowledge of the animal and plants here. We were so blessed by meeting her after we had walked here from the cruise port. Our son had a fabulous time learning from her.
g147366,d148539,February 28 2016,There are educational materials for sale so it appeals to those who want to learn the flora fauna and history of the islands. It is like a working office so you won't get much attention from those who work there although if you ask someone will help you.
g147366,d148539,February 28 2016,
g147366,d148539,February 28 2016,
g147366,d148539,February 28 2016,I visited the centre after my tour of the Mastic Trail. The centre has a variety of books gifts and maps available for purchase. I picked up a small book with pictures and descriptions of the wildlife that is native on the Mastic Trail.
g147366,d148539,February 28 2016,Well located and surrounded by greenery. Availability of library and information from well-nformed staff. Gift shop has many interesting items.
g147366,d148539,February 28 2016,I worked for the National Trust and I think if you have time to visit there gift shop you will meet the staff that does it all. Each one can give you information you wont find any where else. Worth the 5 minute taxi ride.
g147366,d148539,February 28 2016,Great set of information that will help you explore the island. Pick up a map and other booklets about the attractions and other places on the island.

g147366,d149647,February 6 2016,
g147366,d149647,February 6 2016,5-10min walk from Cruise (tender) Pier and right next to Heroes Square in the heart of George Town. So worth of little stop and few photos.
g147366,d149647,February 6 2016,A small clock tower. Just one of the few things of interest to see in George Town. It stands near the library and across from Heroes Square. It was built in 1937 a plaque on the side states it was built in memory of King George 5th of England
g147366,d149647,February 6 2016,The Clock Tower is a part of the George Town culture among the shops and boutiques. George Town features several landmarks such as the National Museum Library and Post Office. The buildings are pretty and well kept and we enjoyed reading the history of the buildings in the area plus the dedications.
g147366,d149647,February 6 2016,As a professor everywhere I go I make it a point to visit historic sites local libraries museums civic centers and etcetera. The Clock Tower in Georgetown Cayman Islands is an important landmark and is just opposite and inspiring sculpture commemorating the brave women of the Cayman Islands. The town library is also across from The Clock Tower.
g147366,d149647,February 6 2016,This really is just a little clock tower. Not a lot more to it really and it's amazing that it even gets listed as a tourist "sight". If you don't happen to see it from your taxi as you go past don't make an effort to see it - you haven't missed anything!
g147366,d149647,February 6 2016,Not the most interesting clock tower or plaza. It's a small and very simple clock tower in the central square. George Town doesn't have much to see or do.
g147366,d149647,February 6 2016,
g147366,d149647,February 6 2016,Located where Edward Street dead ends into Fort Street the Clock Tower is an attractive memorial to King George V and is often used as a meeting place. While not a must see it is located in front of the equally attractive 1919 Peace Memorial and near Heroes Square and worth a quick look if in the area.
g147366,d149647,February 6 2016,
g147366,d149647,February 6 2016,Nice clock in Georgetown not a must see but still if you are walking the cityneat for a quick photo. It's a good place to center walking tour around. near the bus terminal.

g147366,d1818306,March 3 2016,My husband and father caught several fish on their beautiful boat! We also went snorkeling and to sting ray city. Beautiful boat and very attentive nice captain! I will definitely use Slackem again. Thank you so much for such a wonderful experience!

g147366,d184722,February 14 2016,We had a short walk in Georgetown. Baywalk was nice. Couple of souvenir shops. Nice resto. Nice sun. Nice walk and some nice finds.
g147366,d184722,February 5 2016,Good place to get information. One place that I have not seen on trip adviser is the motor car museum. The man that owns it has so many older cars such as Porsche Bentley RR and so on. The highlight was the Bat Mobile from Adam West ea.
g147366,d184722,February 5 2016,

g147366,d184722,February 5 2016,Very helpful and friendly. My husband also took a sole parachute ride from a motor boat. This was a FIRST. He really enjoyed that as well at 72 yrs. I know that is not the correct description but know you will understand the event.
g147366,d184722,February 5 2016,
g147366,d184722,February 5 2016,Donna was very nice and helpful... She told me about stingray city and how to get there and is going to send information about activities on island..
g147366,d184722,February 5 2016,
g147366,d184722,February 5 2016,The CI Dept of Tourism is great place to start in know what to do on the Island. Thre is more to the island than diving. The CIDT will help in find restaurants and other points of interest.

g147366,d1857177,February 5 2016,We went here for a kid's birthday activity. The kids had a series of races and then the adults had a go as well. We are planning on going back so the adults can have a real Grand Prix! Helmets and liners provided. No safety issues at all and the cars seemed to go pretty well!
g147366,d1857177,February 5 2016,
g147366,d1857177,February 5 2016,
g147366,d1857177,February 5 2016,Pure fun. A great adrenaline rush. I love it everytime I go. Only thing to be warned about is the mosquitos. For the price it's a GREAT way to have fun for locals or tourists!
g147366,d1857177,February 5 2016,
g147366,d1857177,February 5 2016,1st night was great but we were the only ones there2nd night we were treated very poorly do to the fact that we were tourist

g147366,d2011683,February 5 2016,This was so much fun! Walking on water in the Caribbean Sea on the Cayman Islands was such a great experience. I can't wait to do it again when I'm back in Cayman. It's such an exhilarating and exciting thing to do. The kids loved it too!!
g147366,d2011683,February 5 2016,
g147366,d2086976,February 13 2016,
g147366,d2086976,February 13 2016,The course needs a lick of paint and it is expensive to play. Considering there are not many land based things to do with the family in Cayman this is a great option.
g147366,d2086976,February 13 2016,We were the only ones at the golf course for a night family mini golf outing. The course needed a little updating but we had fun anyway. Very reasonable price ($5.00 per person) but you got what you paid for. I would recommend doing this just for the fun of it.
g147366,d2086976,February 13 2016,
g147366,d2086976,February 13 2016,This was a pleasant way to spend a few hours. Good entertainment for the family and probably the cheapest activity you will find in GC! The putting surface in many places needs to be repaired but overall a good experience.
g147366,d2086976,February 13 2016,
g147366,d2086976,February 13 2016,We wanted to kill sometime so we went it is definitely in need of attention but it was fun all the same. For the price who does not like a round of mi golf.
g147366,d2086976,February 13 2016,A good way to spend half an hour after a day at the beach. Good value and well kept course. Lizards add to the obstacles!!
g147366,d2086976,February 13 2016,
g147366,d2086976,February 13 2016,Each year we always stop by and play a round or two. It's fun and family friendly. Directly across from the Hyatt Beach Suites and next to Decker's restaurant it's a great post dinner way to spend a little family time. While not new it's well kept and a decent place for putt-putt.
g147366,d2086976,February 13 2016,I went with my family! And for the amount you pay 7 us per persond is very good! We play twice for the same price! ..... To do something diferents i recomend to go! Is music all the time! The hole are nice! And no mosquitos! For me !

g147366,d2103218,February 3 2016,We were on a cruise and decided to take an excursion swimming with the sting rays. What an amazing experience! Bert was absolutely the best!!!!!!!!!!! We will be back soon and hope to do the same thing with this company!

g147366,d2103218,February 3 2016,The guides were very professional. We did the Sting Ray city excursion. LOVED IT! Will do it again on our next cruise.
g147366,d2385016,February 28 2016,
g147366,d2385016,March 9 2016,Here for the day off the cruise ship. Snorkelling was wonderful beautiful fish a couple of reefs and the colour of the water! Wow! and then we spent the afternoon on Seven Mile Beach. Wonderful spot to relax with the bar restrooms and ocean within easy reach. Would definitely go back there! Loved it!
g147366,d2385016,March 1 2016,Have been here many times on cruises and now when we stayed for 10 days. Is a zoo when cruise ships are in port but there are numerous places to shop and eat. Paradise bar/Eden rock are right there w/ good access to snorkel.
g147366,d2385016,February 28 2016,A nice little port to visit. Full of jewelry shops stores boutiques and eateries. If you are looking at watches make sure you price them stateside before committing as some prices are a little on the high side even with a "35"% discount.
g147366,d2385016,February 28 2016,Plenty of shops to check out and places to pop into to grab a quick drink or a bite to much on while strolling around. Nothing to write home about
g147366,d2385016,February 26 2016,Love to browse through all the shops and of course a stop at Margaritaville. Great time and waiting for our next visit in two weeks.
g147366,d2385016,February 24 2016,Very over crowded and full of people from the large cruise ships. It's not our scene and cannot imagine this being your impression of what Grand Cayman is actually like. If you are looking for kitschy souvenirs this is the place. To us a vacation is relaxing calm this is NOT that.
g147366,d2385016,February 23 2016,This area is nice and clean with many many shops and quite a few restaurants. There are chickens running all over Grand Cayman but it still seems clean. There are a variety of stores - some just toursity souveniers and others specialty shops and fine jewelry and art.
g147366,d2385016,February 21 2016,
g147366,d2385016,February 20 2016,Biggest attraction of the shopping area might be Margariteville. But you can also find reasonable priced souvenirs. Don't just stay in the main margaritaville area walk around a little bit and you will find better deals. I found Oackley sun glasses at the same price as in the US.
g147366,d2385016,February 17 2016,Really enjoyed our stopover in Georgetown. Found some nice souveniers not the tacky ones in most port towns. Enjoyed shopping without being hounded.
g147366,d2454048,March 9 2016,
g147366,d2454048,March 9 2016,Friendly staff. Nice variety of items for sale. Prices seem to be reasonable. We were able to walk from the house we were staying.
g147366,d2454048,March 5 2016,Stopped by on the way to the airport because of a friend who enjoys vacation shopping and saw it in a magazine. This tiny place is jam-packed with goodies. I spent less than $100 and got some beautiful prints and other souvenirs. Beautiful original art is available. There are items in a wide range of prices for all budgets.
g147366,d2454048,March 5 2016,
g147366,d2454048,March 4 2016,This shop is great for buying anything.. Jewelry  art clothing and home décor...It's a must see if your in town.
g147366,d2454048,March 2 2016,A must see place if you want to buy something local as a gift or souvenir. You may find great local art pieces to hang on your wall back home. Bring a little Cayman back with you.
g147366,d2454048,March 2 2016,
g147366,d2454048,March 1 2016,
g147366,d2454048,February 29 2016,Lady behind the counter was a little weird and made strange comments but the store offers good local nicknacks. Cute ornaments too!!
g147366,d2454048,February 26 2016,We go to this art store every visit to grand Cayman. Best art and gifts on the islands. Love this place!
g147366,d2454048,February 26 2016,Loved the local jewelry selection....pretty extensive. Painted wood bowls painted linens candles and shell items also very nice. Crowded aisles made it difficult to move around so left sooner than I would have liked. Check out was slow and inefficient. Need better process.

g147366,d3207626,February 8 2016,
g147366,d3207626,February 8 2016,The National Gallery is almost hidden away on the road North of the Airport on the way towards Seven Mile Beach. It is very quiet but a haven with a good collection of art relevant to Cayman together with a small sculpture garden outside. Doesn't take long to visit but it is worth the detour
g147366,d3207626,February 8 2016,
g147366,d3207626,February 8 2016,The center is a beautiful building but the displays are very limited. We were surprised on what little is in the building a lot of empty space

g147366,d3226576,March 1 2016,We came here to attend mass while on the island. The congregation was very welcoming. The celebration was traditional & fun. Worship & praise with the locals was the best experience!
g147366,d3226576,March 1 2016,We are Catholic and have been to church here on several visits. The people are very welcoming and the service was beautiful!
g147366,d3226576,March 1 2016,i have been there on july 2015 for the fund riser program hosted by Indian society for Nepal earthquake which was inside the ground on ST. Ignatus catholic church.thank you for that.
g147366,d3226576,March 1 2016,
g147366,d3226576,March 1 2016,Go early try and share a cab with others in hotel.. georgetown is essentially closed on Sunday so the bus driver drove us right there.
g147366,d3226576,March 1 2016,St. Ignatius church is a really beautiful church & very cozy! I liked the way the church is decorated & designed. I disliked the off-the-beaten-track location but certainly would go there again.
g147366,d3226576,March 1 2016,the church is ope- you go when you want- have a super vacation knowing you did what you do the church has a great community of people

g147366,d3736744,February 8 2016,It was a nice tour...about 45minutes to an hour. Wonderful view of many different types of fish and 2 shipwrecks.

g147366,d3746174,February 8 2016,Great place to be to swim & snokel. There's a hut that sells corel but loved seeing it under water. The water is beautiful.

g147366,d4729113,February 26 2016,We had a great time!!!! Perfect rain day adventure. Ok endless shots are great any day. We felt like we never needed to leave. I would go back for sure.

g147366,d8803489,February 8 2016,
g147366,d8803489,February 6 2016,Few steps from sea front and about 5-10min walk from Cruise (tender)Pier. Interesting place especially if you know something about Cayman Islands' most influental and important people and their history. Some nice statues too.
g147366,d8803489,February 6 2016,We were here on Heroes" Day. The square was packed in preparation for the day's festivities. Lots of officials and locals gather to celebrate the heroes of the island. The statues are very well done and tell a story of the island's history. Watch out for the chickens. They come to celebrate as well. A great party atmosphere!
g147366,d8803489,February 6 2016,Found this wandering around town. Very nice place. Interesting place to visit a lot of history celebrated.
g147366,d8803489,February 6 2016,Statues of VIP's public buildings and chickens. We were there on a Sunday so the museum library and post office were closed but there were a bunch of chickens!
g147366,d8803489,February 6 2016,This small square is neatly set out under palm trees in the heart of George Town. It has several tasteful statues and memorials. By the square are the library and Peace Memorial. Spending fifteen minutes there gives an insight into Aruba's people and history.

g147367,d149244,February 16 2016,I have dived on many of the world's reefs but you need a strong nerve to attempt the wall. Great coral and sea life which can be seen from snorkel sub or scuba. Just like stepping off the Empire State - makes The Abyss a reality show.
g147367,d149244,February 16 2016,
g147367,d149244,February 16 2016,We entered through Macabuca Restaurant and stayed along the Western Wall. It was by far the best snorkeling we did on the island. We saw the best variety of sea life during this snorkel. It would be an amazing dive. It's worth it plus it's amazingly located. Get out of the water...grab a drink and some delicious food.
g147367,d149244,February 16 2016,We actually didn't get to dive the Wall but we did do the Submarine dive at night and it moves along the Wall. Very beautiful and lots too see.
g147367,d149244,February 16 2016,There is a ton of great dive locations on the western wall. Every one I've seen is worth checking out. The water is some of the calmest ever. Definitely would recommend diving the western side of Grand Cayman.

g147367,d1886457,March 3 2016,Had a great time even though I get sea sick. They took care of the equipment and were friendly and knowledgeable
g147367,d1886457,March 2 2016,Went out with Ollie Bradley and Heather. Bradley picked us up and dropped my wife and I back at the cruise ship pier after the dive arranged the dive trip myself and after talking to fellow cruise passengers we paid less and had a better time than those who booked it through the cruise line
g147367,d1886457,February 28 2016,Picked this crew on a friends recommendation. Great crew. Full service. Had really special swim through hung out with friendly sharks and the Kittywake was awesome. Mostly great dive masters. Would have liked a little more attention when I got narked at 105 ft. But overall this is a great dive company.

g147367,d1886457,February 25 2016,We did some diving with the Cayman Turtle Divers crew last week and were very happy with the experience. The team was friendly and knowledgeable but Bradley needs a new wetsuit to keep from shivering! Hope to see you again soon!

g147367,d2148652,February 23 2016,My wife and I had a wonderful time. The guide was very friendly and informative. We spent time at four different locations. For a comprehensive full day (6 hours) at a good price Cayman Six Senses can't be beat. Don't fall for the imposter try to copy the program they developed. Go with caymansixsenses.com.
g147367,d2148652,February 23 2016,The highlight of the trip for us and the kids. An excellent tour that was not crowded and beat the crowds (which did not take long to build up). I would recommend using them and doing the early tour if you want to avoid crowds and get on the water early.
g147367,d2148652,February 22 2016,Donnovan from South Africa was out tour guide today. He picked us up at the assigned time and location. We went February 22 2016. Beautiful day lots of wonderful information. Seeing the stingrays was an amazing experience and he helped with photos and helping us hold the Rays. Would highly recommend this tour.
g147367,d2181173,February 22 2016,
g147367,d2181173,February 22 2016,I went on a stingray adventure with value watersports. Although it was adequate their photographer Leon never sent me my picture. I paid $10. Do not be ripped off like I was.

g147367,d2181173,February 22 2016,My second time in Cayman Islands with my 9 year old boy. We had an awesome time. Leon and Captain Shaun are great friendly and have patience to explain and teach us about stin grays. Thank you guys!

g147367,d2181173,February 22 2016,
g147367,d2181173,February 22 2016,These guys were great! The captain was very knowledgeable and very patient with everyone and answered many questions about the rays. Leon took great pictures and are very reasonable to purchase as well. We will use these guys again! Thomas family...

g147367,d2385044,March 10 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 10 2016,If you just want to relax on the beach this is the place to do it see Ron and Janet to get chairs umbrellas snorkel gear and they even take people on the banana boat. Enjoy one of the best beaches in the world.
g147367,d2385044,March 9 2016,Loved the Marriott where we stayed but the beach itself was very narrow. Water was gorgeous though.
g147367,d2385044,March 9 2016,water is amazing everywhere on the island Don't miss the giant tarponswimming by the shore in George town
g147367,d2385044,March 9 2016,One of the best beaches in the world! Deep powdery sand a gentle breeze and the bluest clearest water you ever hope to find!
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,This was the best beach...clear water and powdery sand you can't ask for anything better. The water is calm and relaxing. Go snorkeling at many of the accessible spots such as chesseburger reef. Such a great place!
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,What do you think of when you think Cayman beaches. "Seven Mile Beach" You at least have to say you've been there. It's very commercialized. But there our places that are a little secluded you just have to find them.
g147367,d2385044,March 7 2016,Wonderful beachstaff so helpful.In fact greatest guy Joey even tad our chairs and towels set out for us each day.Guys are fantasticso friendly.
g147367,d2385044,March 7 2016,This was a day trip very easy to get to from the cruise ship. The water and sand is amazing. Pliantly of area to stretch out and enjoy the beach and watch people.
g147367,d2385044,March 6 2016,I liked the famous seven mile beach but there are so many hotels that have claimed parts of the beach that people tend to congregate around the same areas and it can get very crowdy.
g147367,d2385044,March 5 2016,We first stumbled upon Seven Mile Beach while looking for a grocery store. We parked along the street in front of the Marriott Hotel and walked in from the public access trail. The beach was amazing and very well maintained.
g147367,d2385044,March 5 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 5 2016,Stunning sand stunning turquoise sea stunning views and wonderful safe swimming a must see and must be one of the best beaches in the world.
g147367,d2385044,March 5 2016,Truely "The Caribbean's Best Beach" and the food was perfect. From the time you arrive you are greeted with warmth and a smile. The people are the best part of Grand Cayman.
g147367,d2385044,March 5 2016,Beautiful white sand beach and turquoise waters. The beach was not crowded during our December visit. You can walk the entire beach if you like. Nothing more to say. It's a great beach.
g147367,d2385044,March 5 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 5 2016,The beach boasts lovely sand and beautiful clear blue seas typical of the Caribbean. We walked the length of the beach and it really is a very long way! There are lots of water sports available if you wish to take part or lots of places you can hire sunbeds to sit back relax and take in the beautiful scenery.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Such a breathtaking view with warm light blue waters. Sand is nice in some areas but we found the waterfront rocky and kept stumbling upon broken green pieces of glass along the whole shore.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Spent the day relaxing at the beach. We travelled here by taxi from the port to the Royal Palms Hotel. There we were able to rent chairs use the bathrooms and showers. We had excellent friend calamari and beer. It was a great place to relax for the day. We were able to walk and swim.
g147367,d2385044,March 3 2016,Hopped off a tour bus the moment we seen the beach. Nice relaxing place. We did not happen to be by a resort or anything so chairs and umbrellas were out of the question. Still had a great time. Was able to flag down a bus and get back to the ship.
g147367,d2385044,March 3 2016,This is an amazing place. The water is a beautiful blue-green clear calm and relatively shallow until the drop off allowing you to enjoy the beach. The sand is soft and ready for sand castle building. The waves are typically calm. Oh the sunsets are absolutely magical. We come here all the time and love it.
g147367,d2385044,March 3 2016,Although technically only about 5 miles long Seven Mile Beach is one of my favorites. I enjoy going for a 2 mile walk along the beach first thing in the morning. The water is beautiful safe for swimming and quite sandy with little seaweed. Perfect view for a Cayman Sunset.
g147367,d2385044,March 3 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 3 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 2 2016,It is peaceful and amazing and soft sand and great people. Closest you can come true heaven and not die! Sunsets are amazing and I will not say to die for ha ha ha
g147367,d2385044,March 2 2016,Beautiful white sand clear blue water. You can see the clarity of the water for quite a way out. The beach is combed clean every morning. Even with busy hotels the beach did not seem too crowded. The Caribbean water is clean and warm perfect to play in!
g147367,d2385044,March 1 2016,We spent our family vacation on this clean beautiful peaceful beach. You can be as active or restful as you like. There is something for everyone. There are no heavy water currents - perfect for swimming. Although this is far from a secluded beach it is never too loud. "Simply beautiful."
g147367,d2385044,March 1 2016,This was a port of call for us and it was absolutely amazing.. The entrance to the island was breathtaking.. We took a bus ride to the beach and when we arrived it was absolutely AMAZING.. The underwater scenery was the most beautiful thing ive ever seen.. The drop off was incredible..Well worth the money!!
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Excellent beach with spectacular view and water activies. One of the best beaches we have ever visited and that is saying a lot as we lived in Hawaii and Southern California and have visited beaches all over the world!
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Not only is it a great swimming beach for the whole family but it is great for snorkeling right off shore. There are natural and man-made reefs a walking distance from the shore with an array of tropical fish to be seen.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Really enjoyed this beach....clean cool sand and firm enough for walking. All the properties on the beach seem to take pride in keeping their beach sections clean and beautiful. The turquoise and green colors of the water affirm you that you're in the Caribbean!
g147367,d2385044,February 28 2016,One of the cleanest safest beaches around! One of our favorites in the world! You will not be bothered by panhandlers or by people selling things on the beach. You can walk for miles or just enjoy a cocktail on the beach from one of the luxury hotels. Look forward to the next trip!

g147367,d2385044,February 28 2016,There's a reason Seven Mile Beach has been ranked among the very most beautiful beaches in the world. Every good thing you have heard or read is true. This beach alone is worth the trip to Grand Cayman.
g147367,d2385044,February 28 2016,Beautiful beach Clean Water is crystal clear Sometimes very busy Chairs can be to close and not much room to move around
g147367,d2385044,February 28 2016,A truly LONG WIDE beach great for running/walking/watching the sea. Not much boat traffic or noise just beautiful views and sky!
g147367,d2385044,February 28 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 28 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 28 2016,We were in the middle of this lovely stretch of white sand and enjoyed walking snorkeling wave runners kayaks SUP and just relaxing. The parasail boats are going most of the day and there of course is diving and more. A beautiful place to vacation!
g147367,d2385044,February 27 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 26 2016,This beach is miles of beautiful views and white sand beach. Can see the cruise ships in the harbor and many boating an water activities.

g147367,d2385044,February 24 2016,Clean safe and never a bad view 7 mile beach is fantastic. Stay to the North end of the beach (Ritz Carlton and up) to avoid the cruise shippers who descend upon the areas closest to Georgetown.
g147367,d2385044,February 24 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 24 2016,Seven mile beach is a beautiful clean beach with safe swimming for all ages snorkeling areas the public beach has a children's playground and covered areas with a bar nearby
g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,This long stretch of beach is dotted with hotels beach clubs and condominium complexes. You can also find public access areas that allow you to enjoy the beach for practically no charge. In some areas on calm days you can actually snorkel just 50 yards off shore.
g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,We stayed on the quiet end of 7 mile beach and it was gorgeous and peaceful. There was great snorkeling just on the beach.
g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,Warm crystal clear water and miles of soft sand ideal for a walk. Evenings are also a highlight as the sun sets after another perfect day.
g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,Beautiful clear water. Soft white sand beach. You can snorkel right off the beach as they have a man made reef
g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,An excellent beach for lounging snorkeling and swimming. The place is exceptionally great when the cruise ship crowd is light. You can also go to several public beaches that are less crowded and very accessible. Cemetery Beach was a place we stopped at a couple of times.
g147367,d2385044,February 22 2016,Seven Mile Beach is the main reason to go to Grand Cayman. Pure white sand - pleasant current - and many areas to access public beach locations. The water is spotlessly clean as is the sand.
g147367,d2385044,February 22 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 22 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 22 2016,Enjoyed our trip to Grand Cayman. Second time there and we will be back. Beach is clean and family friendly.
g147367,d2385044,February 22 2016,Beautiful beach. Grand Cayman Beach Suites is the perfect busy-ness level. Not dead not too crowded
g147367,d2385044,February 22 2016,You can't go wrong here. The Water is beautiful there are plenty of activities or you can do nothing at all. Very relaxing.
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,Seven Mile Beach is a nice Caribbean beach. However when cruise ships coming into port it can be very crowded. And over the years it seems to be coming worse. It is a great beach to watch the sunset. However if you are looking for a quiet secluded photo-worthy Caribbean beach this is NOT it.
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,Great beach although I wish it were a bit wider so that there would be more space for kids to play and to build sand castles etc
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,A great beach...one of the best ever...great to walk along and then stop and have a drink along the way ! a must for a visit to Grand Cayman
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,The beach is clean and the ocean is just beautiful. This is our 2nd trip and it was just as wonderful as the first time we went
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,Great beach with warm blue water. Marriott resort has a bar on the beach that's available to beach goers. One of the best beaches we've ever been too.
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,This was my 2nd trip to Grand Cayman and Seven Mile beach is one of the reasons I come back. White sand that is clean very fine and expansive. Waters are clean warm and sparkling. No question - this beach is busy but I never found it difficult to find a quiet corner.
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,We enjoyed our stay on 7 mile beach. Every evening we watch the sunset. Some areas can be crowded especially the days when the cruise ships are in but totally worth the visit.

g147367,d2689082,March 10 2016,I agree with all of the reviewers stated Captain Mario and his crew were amazing. WHat put this group of gentlemen over the top was the way that they treated the two children on the boat. Every crew member was nice and treated the two children (5) and (4) like they were apart of the vacation.

g147367,d4088002,March 7 2016,This is a public beach in front of the Governor's mansion. Nice sand beach with a parking area for cars. Centrally located on 7 Mile Beach.
g147367,d4088002,March 6 2016,This is a beautiful peaceful quiet beach that has not been spoiled by a "beach club" or resort. If you just want to relax without worrying about people selling you things this is your beach.
g147367,d4088002,March 4 2016,We stayed at the Westin which is next door to Governor's Beach. You can rent snorkel equipment from the hotel or bring your own. No need to take a boat out to snorkel as the fish and coral are wonderful on the reefs in front of the beach.
g147367,d4088002,March 4 2016,Nice clean sandy public beach with lots of sand and the day i was there very little people.. the Governor came out and asked us in for drinks.....not really...... good spot..
g147367,d4088002,February 28 2016,If you're staying off Seven Mile then this is a great place to park and play Otherwise it's a spot along your daily walks not a place to stop in particular Couldn't find fish or coral when snorkeling
g147367,d4088002,February 16 2016,This is our favourite beach - nice sand easy access into the water usually not crowded adequate parking in the shade and easy to get to along West Bay Road.
g147367,d4088002,February 13 2016,This is on the famous seven mile beach. There is parking toilet facilities and great sand. The water is warm and beautiful. If you are looking for a free beach this is a place to go. It is right next to the Weston if you want to buy food. there is a shopping center right across the street
g147367,d4088002,February 12 2016,This beach is just lovely beautiful so relaxing pleasant and enjoyable. The setting the views water color peacefulness it's just serene. You can easily just spend the day there and feel so refreshed. Great place for sunset too.
g147367,d4088002,February 10 2016,We visit a dozen different beaches around the island and we always seem to end up at Governor's at the end of the day. Nice mix of locals and visitors and great for beach walking and people watching!
g147367,d4088002,February 9 2016,I simply love Governor's beach. Some many wonderful memories. I go there every now and then to eat and watch the sunset. One of my favorite places in Grand Cayman

g147367,d8020633,February 26 2016,I would highly recommend this trip for a large group of friends.....the crew of the ship was excellent and the trip delivers as exactly as promised. Great interaction with the stingrays! Good for families or adult groups.
g147367,d8020633,February 26 2016,There are several companies that will take you out to stingray city Anyone with a boat can go there. It's best with a guide unless you know exactly how to handle the stingrays. Try to go when the cruise ships aren't in.
g147367,d8020633,February 20 2016,What a wonderful way to spend a couple of hours in the beautiful warm waters of the Grand Cayman Island. It is awesome to interact with these gentle creatures of the sea and the memories will stay with you for a lifetime.
g147367,d8020633,February 10 2016,this is a must do adventure never seen anything like it had a great time. we went with ambassador divers would highly recommend going with them also!

g147367,d844494,February 10 2016,We did our Cayman diving with these guys while on a cruise ship. They were prompt and accommodating. We dove the USS Kittiwake and No Name Reef. The ship was fun to explore with plenty of easily swim-throughs. We would definitely return to dive with these guys (and girls) during another visit to Cayman.
g147367,d844494,February 10 2016,Lots of dive shops. Smaller operators have smaller number of divers. We picked a PADI shop - last day there we were only two divers on the boat.
g147367,d844494,February 10 2016,
g147367,d844494,February 10 2016,Diving is wonderful. West Wall has the calmest seas in the world! Sea Turtles Moray Eels and lots of fish to see.

g1722406,d1977268,March 4 2016,Thank for the greatest experience ever! Captain Chris was so knowledgeable and feeding the stingrays is not to be missed. It was WELL worth the money spent. The snorkel spot he brings you to after is just as amazing. Personally I think having the right captain makes a big difference. Captain Chris made the experience even more amazing.

g1722406,d1977268,February 23 2016,My family has stayed on 7 Mile Beach for many years and started doing weekly rentals with White Sand Water Sports a few years ago. They have always accommodated us and given fantastic customer service- and great rates for weekly rentals. Highly recommend!

g1722406,d1977268,February 3 2016,We took the sunrise trip to stingray city it was the highlight of our trip! Captan Chris was fantastic!!!! He even held the stingrays so we could feed them or get that kiss for good luck!! Use them for your trip out there. Simply awesome!!

g2194940,d3967728,March 4 2016,Great photo opportunities with giant concrete creatures. Worth the quick pull off the road to admire.
g2194940,d3967728,March 1 2016,We have been to Davinoff's many times and watched David create. This year we got to see his new fabulous octopus Spectre. Our grown kids loved it and so did we. It was so great for photos.
g2194940,d3967728,February 26 2016,What a wonderful spot. The owners are the best to share their sculptures with everyone! There are very few things in the Caymens that are free but this is one of them. Don't hesitate to stop for a photo opp.
g2194940,d3967728,February 21 2016,Such an interesting place. We stopped in to check out the sculptures. The owner David an his wife came out to say hello and talk about each of the huge sculptures. Such nice people! It's fun and free and a great photo op.
g2194940,d3967728,February 5 2016,
g2194940,d3967728,February 5 2016,A great stop for a unique experience. David and his wife are very hospitable and will take time to give a personal tour. Guarantee you will never see anything like this anywhere!
g2194940,d3967728,February 5 2016,Stopped by after visiting Queens Monument beach. Doesn't take but 15 minutes to see and its fun. Kids would love it. Oversized and cleverly done there is a giant crocodilescorpion mermaidiguana and others. Probably not worth a separate trip but if you are heading by car to Rum Point it's worth the diversion.
g2194940,d3967728,February 5 2016,
g2194940,d3967728,February 5 2016,Really a cool thing to go and see. A lot of people who live here don't even know it's there. Kids love it as well as adults. Great photo ops!

g259440,d1432009,March 5 2016,A short drive past El Limon this secluded beach is really a haven for privacy great surf and swimming and a lovely day with friends family or a romantic getaway.
g259440,d1432009,March 4 2016,Stunning clean and safe. The beach only a few people enjoying the day it was almost as though we had the beach to ourselves!
g259440,d1432009,February 5 2016,
g259440,d1432009,February 5 2016,One of our favorite beaches in the Las Terranas area. Beautiful quiet beach lovely white sand clear water great for swimming snorkelling and walking
g259440,d1432009,February 5 2016,A beach to die for  hidden away from the masses we were often the only people on the beach ! Take a picnic and drinks  no restuarant or cafe  but what the heck a fantastic beach  one of the best .
g259440,d1432009,February 5 2016,
g259440,d1432009,February 5 2016,I'm Dominican and I can assure that this is one of the best beaches I've ever been in my country. There is not much words to describe how wonderful and magic is this place with nobody around just relaxing and enjoying the nature.

g259440,d2006612,March 10 2016,The beach is like paradise. Absolutely beautiful. And my husband rented a surfboard for about 10 dollars for an hour he had a blast.
g259440,d2006612,March 9 2016,Lovely beach with quite a few places to stay right on the beach but surprisingly not many vendors... a few people selling fruit but not the high pressure stuff you can get other places. Nice sand and not too rough. We even went swimming during the full moon and no-one bothered our stuff. Wonderful place!
g259440,d2006612,March 7 2016,
g259440,d2006612,March 5 2016,Bonita is lovely stretch of beach in the Las Terrenas area where there are options for eating and drinking as well as hours of family fun in the sun and clear waters.
g259440,d2006612,March 4 2016,
g259440,d2006612,March 4 2016,There's a eatery there we had the the best fish there! loved it warm quiet beach a river goes i the water.
g259440,d2006612,March 2 2016,This beach is beautiful. White sands between your toes and listening to the surf is the way to go! Some surfers but other than that quiet and safe.
g259440,d2006612,February 29 2016,Lovely walking along this beach a few good places to eat along here. used a local motorconcho taxi (motorbike) to get here from Las Terrenas.
g259440,d2006612,February 21 2016,
g259440,d2006612,February 20 2016,Probably our favorite beach for proximity and natural setting recently improved with an interlock brick road unfortunately already ravaged by the receding beach and even more aggressive waves. Lovely restaurants and surfing with Carolina plus a small tranquil nearby be beach and a large and distinctive rock make this place a must see.
g259440,d2006612,February 19 2016,
g259440,d2006612,February 19 2016,Excellent beach for walking and swimming. Close to everything. Some good restaurants near by. Friendly people all around
g259440,d2006612,February 18 2016,What a beautiful beach! Great place to spend the day playing in the waves! A few places to have lunch. But no beach chairs to rent.
g259440,d2006612,February 17 2016,We walked from this beach towards Playa Coson it was rather quiet and this was just perfect for us. The beach is not very wide as in there is not that much space to keep dry from the sea so I wouldn't spend my time on one place for long.
g259440,d2006612,February 14 2016,Beach was average at best. Limited places to eat. And horrible service. The bartender and waitress ignored us for 10 mins and sparse customer base. Was not a very vibrant place to spend an afternoon. Even if you are looking for a quiet beach there are so many more beautiful beaches. Try El Portillo or Playa Poppy
g259440,d2006612,February 11 2016,
g259440,d2006612,February 6 2016,This is the most beautiful beach I have ever seen. I would absolutely recommend travelers to go there for nice relax ;)
g259440,d2006612,February 6 2016,This little beach is a hidden gem! Great for families. Lots of small hotels and restaurants close to the beach.
g259440,d2006612,February 6 2016,Beautiful beach not very wide but almost empty even on holidays. Has enough little nooks to give some privacy. Seems to be popular with locals.
g259440,d2006612,February 6 2016,Playa Bonita & Playa Coson which are right next to each other gorgeous beautiful beaches that stretch on forever. There is a luxury hotel on Bonita but not much development other than that.
g259440,d2006612,February 6 2016,
g259440,d2006612,February 6 2016,
g259440,d2006612,February 6 2016,We visited Playa Bonita as it was suggested to us we need to see. Its a beautiful beach and the area is beautiful. It is a little out of the way though.
g259440,d2006612,February 6 2016,Safe beach for families bar and restaurant  reasonable prices. Enjoyed a fantastic afternoon here with our friends
g259440,d2006612,February 6 2016,This beach is great for surfing but not so much for swimming. There is a nice beach walk with benches to sit and watch the surfers riding the waves - you can also rent a board. A handful of small restaurants offer everything you need.
g259440,d2006612,February 6 2016,This is a very serene beach just off the main areas of Las Terrenas. Perfect to enjoy the atmosphere.
g259440,d2006612,February 6 2016,This beach was stunning! Beautiful sand and nice clear warm water!! We were able to snorkel in this water and did see a few starfish which was fantastic. I would suggest bringing a GoPro as we did or a underwater camera to capture everything! This beach looks like a postcard defiantly recommended !
g259440,d2006612,February 6 2016,Cleanest beach in the DR probably because of the condo units there. Only beach we found that was raked each evening. No trash at all!!
g259440,d2006612,February 6 2016,What a gorgeous beach! A group of 12 of us spent the day there and surfed boogie boarded swam and enjoyed the sun. We were so happy we went there. The only thing we should have done differently is bring some snacks and drinks with us - there isn't a whole lot on the beach.
g259440,d2006612,February 6 2016,Very nice beach to surf and rest under the coconut trees. Easy access with a car parking next to Hotel Acaya.
g259440,d2006612,February 6 2016,The beach isn't the best for lounging about but the water and scenery are beautiful! I suppose hitting this beach at the right tide would make it more accommodating. There are shops and restaurants in town that provide great views and a place to grab a drink or snack.
g259440,d2006612,February 6 2016,Great remote beach. Not much people while great for surf. Just stop there lay down and rest while your kids enjoy surfing. Not much risk.
g259440,d2006612,February 6 2016,
g259440,d2006612,February 6 2016,Our favorite beach in Las Terrenas. A little tricky to get there (you have to meander through some hotel-owned property) but lovely when you do.
g259440,d2006612,February 6 2016,Beautiful beach but beware of the lack of facilities for eating and drinking . Easy drive from las Terrenas  although the local traffic is crazy
g259440,d2006612,February 6 2016,Good for a quiet bath in the caribean sea in family and take a walk my son loved walking around and feeling free
g259440,d2006612,February 6 2016,A very chill beach. There are a few restaurants a surf school condo style hotels. Just outside the craziness of the main town of Las Terrenas.
g259440,d2006612,February 6 2016,Only a very fast visit the last day very nice beach and view. They told us it's a nice spot for snorkeling but that day there was no visibility
g259440,d2006612,February 6 2016,Even though there are expensive fancy restaurants nearby I enjoyed a truly Dominican breakfast by the beach early morning mangù and all. Hired motorcycle (motoconcho) to make arrangements the day before and loved ambiance & relaxed laid back atmosphere.
g259440,d2006612,February 6 2016,The view is breathtaking but the beach area has practically disappear we didn't stay for long due to that. The access have change since a few years ago when I first visited this beach now they have parking lots and signs for the beach.
g259440,d2006612,February 6 2016,beautiful water nice beach tranquil... great way to spend a little time when not occupying a chair at the lazy dog
g259440,d2006612,February 6 2016,Beautiful beach with lovely palm trees everywhere. Highly recommend a visit but I would recommend staying in Las Terrenas and visiting this place and not staying here as there is nothing to do here after sunset
g259440,d2006612,February 6 2016,

g259440,d2006612,February 6 2016,quiet and wonderful water unforgettable!! And you'll get domincans coming to cook for you a real good meal!!!!
g259440,d2006612,February 6 2016,Good food and great price friendly atmoosphere timely service and great drinks buffet was great and my mom loved it
g259440,d2006612,February 6 2016,
g259440,d2006612,February 6 2016,We ended up walking to this beach daily as it was beautiful and quiet away from the hustle and bustle of Las Terrenas. It also offers a deep sand area in the water before the reef starts. Bring your mask and snorkel as the snorkeling is good.
g259440,d2006612,February 6 2016,Amazing beach clean water perfect for snorkeling. We rented surfboards for the kids they had a nice time. We also rented a paddleboard which was a lot of fun too. Great spot for a family to spend the day!
g259440,d2006612,February 6 2016,I must say I was a little disappointed... I visited Playa Coson and Playa Moron and was blown away by their beauty but compared to them Playa Bonita wasn't that special. Don't get me wrong is still a gorgeous beach but other beaches of the area raise the bar very high.
g259440,d2006612,February 6 2016,Best beach ever. And when in luck: a guy with a machete will prepare you fresh coconuts from a tree all while the sun sets.
g259440,d2006612,February 6 2016,Lovely beach for relaxing swimming and water sports. If the surf is up see Johannes at "Pirate Surf". He'll set you up with a good board or a lesson if need be. If the surf is small ask him for a paddleboard. Either way get wet and enjoy this beautiful beach with crystal clear water. It's a great spot.
g259440,d2006612,February 6 2016,
g259440,d2006612,February 6 2016,Beautiful beach that we spent an afternoon at but we liked Coson beach better. There are restaurants and hotels along the beach. It is pretty secluded and very pretty.
g259440,d2006612,February 6 2016,Amazing beach with no "traffic". Love love love! I can't wait to go back. It was just us the beach and relaxation.
g259440,d2006612,February 6 2016,Amazing place gorgeus beach good restaurants and small hotels a lot of tranquility and peace you can visit the limon waterfall  the haitises and the cayo levantado island if you go on the months of january-april you can see the humpback whales
g259440,d2006612,February 6 2016,Great beach we have a wonderful time there. Highly recommended and must visit if you go to Las Terrenas
g259440,d2006612,February 6 2016,
g259440,d2006612,February 6 2016,Beautiful beach in Samana. Quite amazing ideal for the whole family. You can enjoy paddle board kayaking or just enjoy the beach for relaxation.
g259440,d2006612,February 6 2016,
g259440,d2006612,February 6 2016,Playa Bonita is one of the nicest beaches I have ever seen. It's a perfect place for families with children.
g259440,d2006612,February 6 2016,A very nice beach to hang out there are no people bothering you and the water here is just fantastic
g259440,d2006612,February 6 2016,Beach is really nice looking and away from the road so very peaceful and quite. Although it is remote from Las Terrenas and you need a car to get there.

g259440,d2258939,February 20 2016,Loved our two horseback trails..one on the beach  and the other around the ranch. Thomas a very good host . My two girls still talking about Elvis and Caramel ! Brilliant and suitable for beginners and experienced riders.
g259440,d2258939,February 20 2016,Amazing! The tour on way there was great the guide was very knowledgeable. Safe and loved every minute! Only down was there was a lot of tours turning up in one go. But didn't distract from the beauty of the country!
g259440,d2258939,February 20 2016,The ranch is situated in the mountains on our way to Las Terrenas from Sanchez. We had a 45 min. ride in the back mountains and it was very nice.
g259440,d2258939,February 20 2016,A long walk in the mountains; some days later a ride on the long beaches. I liked the helpful guides and the horses which all were in a good shape - and: they care for them.

g259440,d3296110,March 10 2016,The toll road cost $528 each way but saves about a hour or more of travel time. The views from this road are breathtaking.
g259440,d3296110,March 8 2016,
g259440,d3296110,March 7 2016,New road in perfect condition with beautiful scenery. Tolls around 12 USD. Travelling time fo Las Terranes from airport t AZS is 20 min. Taxi (we got a 7 seats van) costs 80$ (tolls included in the price)

g259440,d3296110,February 21 2016,They have to pay for it. About 12 US. There is a mirador. And a cave you can't stop to see The road from Playa Bonita to Puerto Plata is in very bad shape they need a new road.
g259440,d3296110,February 20 2016,I live in Canada and wish I had roads this fantastic. We drove from Cabarete to Las Terrenas. Was not prepared for the cost! The view was great. Make sure to stop and take photos... after all you are paying for them.
g259440,d3296110,February 13 2016,The road is well maintained and traffic is not existent the views on the ocean are good. Ignore garbage along the road...
g259440,d3296110,February 8 2016,This is one of the most expensive toll road in the Dominican Republic (US 11). I prefer to pay it and have a safe and nice ride than take the mountain road from Sanchez.
g259440,d3296110,February 8 2016,The new toll from Santo Domingo to Samana is great! It cuts the travel time between the two locations to about 2.5 hours -- a huge improvement. The Caribe Tours buses that run this route are top notch and I enjoyed the views of the rice paddies hills and western end of the Bay of Samana.
g259440,d4551156,February 8 2016,
g259440,d4551156,February 8 2016,There were like 3-4 slots a few gambling tables and people smoking that we couldn't breathe.. Left there in 15 minutes.
g259440,d4551156,February 8 2016,Typical smal dominican casino slots are basic and table games equivalent to US casinos 20yrs ago. Rules are a bit different here so make sure you understand them prior to playing. Live poker table and on weekends locals play decent games. A bit out of town about 10 mins from Las terrenas center.
g259440,d4551156,February 8 2016,
g259440,d4551156,February 8 2016,Small casino located about 5 minutes from the center of Las Terrenas. Offers table games and slot machines. Small bar right when you walk in the door.

g259440,d5481247,February 8 2016,You'll find touristy priced fancy restaurants bars dance clubs late night pork sandwich a little something for everyone.
g259440,d5481247,February 8 2016,Lots of restaurants in the weekend busy with cars and motorcycles that pollutes the air. Too Bad! They also drive like crazy 😈. So be careful driving here. Some of the restaurants here are very good. Small and cozy.
g259440,d5481247,February 8 2016,
g259440,d5481247,February 8 2016,This is the Main Street where all the restaurants and night clubs are. The restaurants are all great and have fresh fish caught earlier that day. Worth checking out.
g259440,d5481247,February 8 2016,Las Terrenas is a great town and the restaurants are right on the water. I always love coming here. Instagram: @tommiesox
g259440,d5481247,February 8 2016,A lot of option for having dinner sea front. Restaurants with different gastronomy French Italian and Spanish. Cool bars and pubs also can be found around. A must visit place in Las Terrenas!
g259440,d5481247,February 8 2016,The pueblo de los pescadores burned down a little over a year and ahalf ago and now is reopen and running great. 13 restaurants and 3 bars in one location. best place to people watch eat and drink.

g259440,d6211714,February 29 2016,Great for swimming and lined with bars and restaurants. Free sun loungers on the beach. Good eateries. Vendor may come by with coco frio or oysters. Good places to stay near this beach.
g259440,d6211714,February 19 2016,great beach for any age with lots of rental chairs but don't let them charge you more than 100 pesos! and at some bars if you get a drink the chair is free. Be careful of changing prices at some bars!
g259440,d6211714,February 19 2016,This is a beautiful beach but the traffic on the road in Las Terranes is so constant that the noise and pollution ruin it. Go to Las Ballenas or further afield and lets hope Las Terranes takes steps to calm the traffic as it verges on ruining the town.
g259440,d6211714,February 19 2016,
g259440,d6211714,February 19 2016,This beach is perfect because it's secluded yet at walking distance from the main touristic spots. This is perfect to enjoy some alone time with nature at its finest.
g259440,d6211714,February 19 2016,Nice beach - pretty clean. Does have a few rocky spots - need to stick to the central part of the beach to avoid rocks. Windier and more waves on one side of the beach.
g259440,d6211714,February 19 2016,The beach has changed since my last review. A lot more beach bars and restaurants and the lounge rental has been pushed up to the point. Not such a nice place to hang out anymore.
g259440,d6211714,February 19 2016,A lovely stretch of beach right in the heart of the very genuine town of Las Terrenas. There are many beach bars and if you buy a drink or food you can use their lounge chairs at your leisure. It is a great spot~~
g259440,d6558596,March 10 2016,
g259440,d6558596,March 10 2016,
g259440,d6558596,March 3 2016,the beach is very nice not rough waves water is calm there are many nice small hotels in the beach to stay on a budget
g259440,d6558596,March 2 2016,Playa Las Ballenas is the beach to have a nice swim. It has the most quiet water in Las Terrenas and one of the few places where you could do snorkeling. At the same time you have different restaurants and bars directly on the beach as well as the sailing club there. Definitely to be recommended with young children.
g259440,d6558596,February 20 2016,One of the quietest and calmest beaches within walking distance from town with plenty of little restaurants and bars but also fishermen and pristine waters. Perfect for running yoga or just relaxing. Ending the day at this beach is unforgettable.
g259440,d6558596,February 20 2016,Just sit back and look at that unbelievable water. If you have children you cannot find a better spot to enjoy.
g259440,d6558596,February 20 2016,Beautiful Beach and views.. Great Beach shack for lunch the fried calamaris was delicious & the fresh passion fruit juice soooh refreshing
g259440,d6558596,February 19 2016,Great beach beside a nice quiet road water is less likely to be wavy here compared to some of the others.
g259440,d6558596,February 18 2016,
g259440,d6558596,February 18 2016,
g259440,d6558596,February 6 2016,Beautiful beach in Las Terrenas where I spent very nice time full of relax :-) You can walk there or just relax :-)
g259440,d6654222,March 4 2016,
g259440,d6654222,March 4 2016,Was here at the all inclusive. Beautiful beach and great place for a swim. Nice spot for a long walk or run.
g259440,d6654222,February 20 2016,Surrounded by mangroves and with long beaches and shallow waters it is a very relaxing walk but not ideal for swimming ue to the often present algae. You will often see kite surfers doing their acrobatics between this beach and punta pop.
g259440,d6654222,February 14 2016,We stayed at Balcones deal Atlantico. The beaches in this area are spectacular but Playa El Portillo was breath taking. You can walk forever and it's very safe.
g259440,d6654222,February 10 2016,I tought I was in paradise. We could walk for kilometers it was so nice. We could do snorkling it was really beautiful. A place to go back for sure.
g259440,d6654222,February 9 2016,We walked the beach everyday and fed the beach dogs they are so sweet!!! We brought down dog cookies and also fed them sausages. The beach is picture postcard perfect
g259440,d6654222,February 6 2016,Beautiful white sand beach and not a lot of locals to bothered us while we were there. Some friendly private securities with their dogs come by say hi. We saw a couple doing house back riding at the beach totally cool. I wish I know where to one for that. So much to do so little time.
g259440,d6654222,February 6 2016,wonderful holiday in Samana resort was great beautiful grounds and beach blue clear waters hard packed beach could walk forever great staff would return for sure
g259440,d6654222,February 6 2016,Beautiful sandy beach. We can easily walk for 1 or 2 kilometers. Coconut trees all along. Way better than the las terrenas beach. the only bad thing is the all inclusive hotel in the middle....
g259440,d6654222,February 6 2016,I've been to many beaches and this is the best in the world. Nothing more to say best of the best. Just go
g259440,d6654222,February 6 2016,
g317146,d149676,March 9 2016,
g317146,d149676,March 9 2016,Cold and not as clean as I wish it would have been. I also didn't enjoy the wild dogs. I guess I was used to Punta Cana :) A bit spoiled but if you are looking to Party then this is the place.
g317146,d149676,March 9 2016,Beautiful beach. many bars. activities. clean beach and very very clean ocean. many trees and palms.
g317146,d149676,March 9 2016,Lots of restaurants and food services along the beach wall lots of shade if needed. Attentive lounge chair stewards (see Eddie by Scandanavian Grill) . Check out the ribs at the Scandanavian Grill - the BEST
g317146,d149676,March 9 2016,
g317146,d149676,March 8 2016,Been coming to this beach for 30+ years and it is as amazing as the first time. Clear blue waters. Sometimes some waves fun for the children to roll in them. Deep waters. Great for jetskiing and maybe a nice scuba.
g317146,d149676,March 6 2016,You can rent chairs and umbrellas. Outdoor market right behind the trees. Worth to check out if you are in the area
g317146,d149676,March 6 2016,Okay beach but has way too many pestering money begging vendors. Will never go back. Go to Playa Alicia instead. At least there you will be left alone and there is a great outdoor restaurant overlooking the beach.
g317146,d149676,March 6 2016,We are often asked why we only go to Sosua for vacation. This beach is the answer. We would hate to go somewhere else and be disappointed in the location. In Sosua we know what to expect and are never disappointed!
g317146,d149676,March 5 2016,Avoid the weekends as it gets crowded with noisy locals who have no concept about disturbing other beach goers with loud music not everyone's taste. Two rented loungers and umbrella cost 450 pesos compared to Cabarete @ 300 pesos. Food is a rip off. We were charged 450 pesos for a plate of fries. Bathing and snorkeling is great.

g317146,d149676,March 2 2016,Visited three times in the week so we could go out fishing. When we went out fishing the morning view was absolutely stunning. A lot of people were swimming at the beach and snorkeling
g317146,d149676,March 2 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 29 2016,We are staying in Cabarete and decided to spend a few hours in Sosua. Different from Cabarete more people hawking products and restaurants and friendly people in general. Prefer Cabarete by far but a fun change of pace.
g317146,d149676,February 25 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,There is alot of prostitution on this beach but it does not trump the good quality drinks at the bars and the beautiful view
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,The high waves stopped us from going in most days. The beach was nice but you have to pay for an umbrella $3.00 us.
g317146,d149676,February 22 2016,Great beach. Good for lunch tourism and families. Lots of shops and restaurants close to downtown. Pretty decent prices lotsa locals. Fun fun fun! Enjoy good drinks and good food.
g317146,d149676,February 21 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 21 2016,Great way to experience local culture on a beautiful beach! Vendors will rent you chairs and then serve food and drinks (for a fee!)
g317146,d149676,February 21 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 17 2016,Vendors and markets and not too sure about safety of your belongings. Great snorkeling.This is the calmest of all the beaches in the area there is lots of coral and fish to see.
g317146,d149676,February 16 2016,Beautiful beach a few nice little restaurants tons of pushy vendors that are all selling the same stuff...😝
g317146,d149676,February 16 2016,Sunday is the best day if you want to see a lot of people. All other days are good not a lot of traffic. Hecklers will heckle you to come into their stores but just keep moving. They are nice people. Clean and friendly folks.
g317146,d149676,February 15 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 13 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,Cold beer served right to your chair (for a small rental fee). Check out the Reggae Lounge for authentic Jamaican food. It will be the highlight of your beach trip to Sosua.
g317146,d149676,February 11 2016,The beach itself is nice. The locals that hang around and harass you to buy stuff non stop put a damper on things. I would spend my time in Cabarete far sooner than I would go back to Sosua.
g317146,d149676,February 10 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 10 2016,definitely one of the prettiest beaches i have been to in the Caribbean. there are beach side bars and restaurants nestled back in the trees along with typical junk shops
g317146,d149676,February 10 2016,A gorgeous beach in the Dominican Republic as like most others the water is blue the sands are soft . Is not a very large beach so its recommended to go out early to get yourself a lounging chair if you intend on tanning
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Very nice and clean  always a chair and friendly people. please check it out when you are there. Very nice.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,This is my favorite spot in Sosua. With the reef a little ways out in the bay the waves are not overly strong and the water is clear and warm. Beautiful!
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Sosua beach is a nice place to unwind and relax. The only negative is that there are a lot of pushy hustlers trying to sell garbage at high prices. Ignore them and you'll be fine.
g317146,d149676,February 6 2016,Gentle waves no undercurrent. Clear water soft beige sand. Lots of beach huts: bars souvenirs clothes art etc Very colorful!
g317146,d149676,February 6 2016,Beach is pretty with many shopsrestaurants and bars. Some water sports fishing scuba snorkelling banana boats etc. Great people watching
g317146,d149676,February 6 2016,very nice beach a lot of restaurant of different countrysouvenirs bar and of course a lot of tourist mix with the local sunday is the best day familiesfriend best spot for fish and rhum
g317146,d149676,February 6 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 6 2016,It is a nice beach to walk but beware of the vendors they are very pushy and do not leave you alone. They do not know what NO means. Water is clear and nice for swimming just beware
g317146,d149676,February 6 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 6 2016,There are over 100 vendors and restaurants featuring all kinds of cuisines. Prices are reasonable and you can get wifi. Go early to get a good seat.
g317146,d149676,February 6 2016,Living here I do go occasionally to the Beach...many small restaurants and bars on the beach. I love to go with my husband and just sit watch the water and have a drink
g317146,d149676,February 6 2016,the beachb had a lot of people on it a lot of dogs just wandering around.the beach and the venders. we looked at some of the outside resturaunts they looked good a couple we met said sinatras was very good and also captain jacks
g317146,d149676,February 6 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 6 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 6 2016,Was clean hot fun lots off people good chairs the beach attendees were very helpful there lots of place to put garbage.
g317146,d149676,February 6 2016,I was there on Wednesday and the beach i first visited has changed no longer family friendly the beach is eroded and loaded with venders and prostitutes not worth the trip to the beach.
g317146,d149676,February 6 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 6 2016,Have been to the Dominican Republic so many times as we love the place. Sousa is not a brilliant resort. We stopped here for a couple of hours on a day trip. Would not book here for a full holiday.
g317146,d149676,February 6 2016,Many of the Dominicans prefer this beach as it is one of the first and everyone is very pleasant to deal with. Many little restaurants on the water and plenty of umbrellas and chairs to rent at a very reasonable rate.
g317146,d149676,February 6 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 6 2016,dirty beach and big waves most have the time its a locals beach lots have vanders you have to pay for your chair
g317146,d149676,February 6 2016,Overrated crazy busy alot of store fronts and little restaurants. Beach was calmer however. You have to pay for chairs and umbrellas and beach itself was quite short.
g317146,d149676,February 6 2016,The views are fantastic the shops and vendors are great the multitude and diversity of the restaurants and food is unbelievable....the water is crystal clear and warm!!
g317146,d149676,February 6 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 6 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 6 2016,Beautiful water not so crowded beach plenty of activities (swim snorkel dive banana boat fish...) and good food and drinks... What not to love?
g317146,d149676,February 6 2016,The title says it all! Enjoy and get yourself ready for some big waves! Be careful of vendors who do not tell you about a beach chair use "cost".... they stuck it on our bill after we ordered some food.... not expensive - but annoying to have that happen... Take your snorkelling gear... :)
g317146,d149676,February 6 2016,What a gorgeous still off-the-beaten-track carribean beach. Love the beauty lack of crowds gorgeous blue water and wonderful white sand.
g317146,d149676,February 6 2016,The beach was average size somewhat busy...yet appreciated. The true beauty is the fact that it backs onto tourist kiosks with shaded areas. You could purchase clothing sculptures foods etc.

g317146,d1556705,February 28 2016,We had 2 divers (first timers) 2 snorkelers and 1 passenger. They took great care of all of us and were professional and experts. We were never left alone but attended to at all times.

g317146,d5112518,March 10 2016,My family and I visited this "museum" based on all the positive reviews it received here on TripAdvisor. What a mistake! Forget the descriptions like "interesting weird and different." I warn everyone that this place is steeped in Voodoo worship and Satanism. We wish we had never set foot in it.
g317146,d5112518,February 15 2016,oh my god i didn't know that beautiful museum exist in the heart of sosua located on a very nice location and area close to a lot of residencial i went inside that was a missing too bad not a lot of tourist know about it it is a must see
g317146,d5112518,February 13 2016,Wow walked up the hill from downtown Sosua up to the castle. What an awesome experiencefantastic pieces of art sculptures depicting a lot of the Haitain themes a little scary not a place you would take young children the owner who lives in the castle interesting gentlemen....... 300 pesos entry fee
g317146,d5112518,February 11 2016,
g317146,d5112518,February 6 2016,You must see this Museum Gallery. You'll never see anything like it again. A combination of Haitian art  sculpture extraterrestrial themes and amazing architecture.
g317146,d5112518,February 6 2016,
g317146,d5112518,February 6 2016,Incredible collection of Haitian art in a bizarre building spiced up by enormous replicas of flying saucers (no I'm not kidding). I could go on but this is a 'don't miss'.
g317146,d5112518,February 6 2016,The owner was not there and it was the Summer. But I found it very interesting to see the different art objects and the way someone's mind works. I would say it is a must see.

g317146,d7713099,February 6 2016,We visited a week ago and saw some amazing local artists take on the history of Sosua. it was interesting to see recognizable landmarks as they were years ago i highly recommend this exhibition. We will return!!!!
g317146,d7713099,February 6 2016,I went to an exposition Sosua Vivo by Bill Passmore and I can say I loved this exposition about the ocean and the colorful living of the sea.
g317146,d7713099,February 6 2016,A must visit if you want to learn more about Sosua`s culture shown in exhibits of local artists. The house of culture of Sosua does more than just portray good art it also teaches music ballet and other disciplines to local kids.
g317146,d7713099,February 6 2016,Went there not knowing what to expect the art there was amazing different and interesting! After taking a tour there ask to speak with Rolf
g317146,d7713099,February 6 2016,Casa de Arte Sosua is a great place to meet the work of local artists. By this is not ment the mostly haitian paintings sold at the beach huts/souvenir shops. Worth checking it out!

g317146,d7713123,February 19 2016,Nice and quiet beach perfect to relax and enjoy your time.... I prefer that beach over more crowded one in the area
g317146,d7713123,February 17 2016,large beach easy access from Casa Marina or down street from Las Terraza condos. Public but not bothered by too many vendors. Not monitored swim at own risk.
g317146,d7713123,February 12 2016,For the DR this is not a very impressive beach. No palm trees to give you shade and a bit of a lack of service. Sosua beach is much prettier calmer water and lots more choices of food etc. Also better prices on Playa Sosua.
g317146,d7713123,February 12 2016,Beach is so beautiful and calm  water is very clear . loved going there and enjoyed being left alone from all sellers. Close to a restaurant and it is big and beautiful. My only choice in Sosua for swimming and being able to leave things on the beach.
g317146,d7713123,February 10 2016,this beach is fairly new having developed as a result of a hurricane a handful of years back. nice quiet out of the way family beach
g317146,d7713123,February 8 2016,This commerce-free beach is located in the center of Sosua . You can go there and relax in peace. The surroudings are beautiful too.
g317146,d7713123,February 8 2016,
g317146,d7713123,February 8 2016,At one time this beach was completely under water. It is very beautiful and located in Sosua. Wear some type of foot wear as the sand gets very hot. There is a nice little restaurant above the beach. Join
g317146,d7713153,February 12 2016,
g317146,d7713153,February 12 2016,Sosua was built by Jewish refugees from Europe and the museum tells a bit of this story. If you are interested in the topic then there are several books to read which will be far more informative. Still do pay a visit in Sosua it is not that many other museums to go to.
g317146,d7713153,February 11 2016,stop by a couple times not open would have been nice to visit hard to put in 100 words about a place that is closed LOL
g317146,d7713153,February 11 2016,we went to the jewish mueseum there was not a lot to see i think if u were jewish u would be dissapointed i dont really now what we were expecting.Maybe we were expecting too much. But it gave us something to do during the morning when it was hot
g317146,d7713153,February 11 2016,The contributions of the Philipp family to Sosua are completely ignored. Both Bruno and Thomas Philipp were important figures in the history of the colony.
g317146,d7713153,February 11 2016,
g317146,d7713153,February 11 2016,
g317146,d7713153,February 11 2016,Amazing learning experience. I had no idea that Jews settled in the DR during World War II. It is a small museum-----it should take you no more than 1 hour to learn quite a lot about this unique bit of history.
g317146,d7713153,February 11 2016,Finally after many years going to Sosua we visited the Jewish Museum next to the Casa Marina Hotel. Although it was very small it was very informative. Many nice photos and artifacts. It told the story of how the Jewish people came to the DR during the war
g317146,d7713153,February 11 2016,It is good place to know about the history of this town. It was a shame that pictures are not allowed to take inside the museum.

g317146,d7985993,February 11 2016,Besides being a fantastic artist and a really descent man Leo also will do custom framing and canvas mounting AND HE IS VERY GOOD AT IT!!
g317146,d7985993,February 11 2016,
g317146,d7985993,February 11 2016,Leo Diaz is truly a unique gifted talented artist. With such a creative imagination his art gallery is a visual feast and experience worth a visit with the whole family while in Sosua. Well known locally and with an increasing international following he is one artists work to follow. Don’t miss the opportunity to visit his gallery.
g317146,d7985993,February 11 2016,
g317146,d7985993,February 11 2016,Leo's Art Gallery in Sosua on the way to the main beach of Sosua is a different place. His Gallery offers many very unique paintings and other pieces of decoration. Further there are t shirts coffee mugs beach bags to get with his own designs.
g3176298,d5504431,March 3 2016,
g3176298,d5504431,March 8 2016,The activities are ok but much better opportunities to enjoy ziplines and segways exist in the area.
g3176298,d5504431,March 7 2016,Very iver rated. Be prepared for alot of walking and a tour of the slums of the DR. Staff was helpful not a great excursion
g3176298,d5504431,March 3 2016,
g3176298,d5504431,February 28 2016,
g3176298,d5504431,February 22 2016,Loved the zip line and horseback riding the bungy jumping was ok. It was a good excursion for the half day-however the picture disc they sell at the end is very expensive
g3176298,d5504431,February 22 2016,Some of the activities wasn't how the look like and it's a lot of walk while they showing the dinosaurs I like the paint balls and the zipline and the roll ball was the best I had the whole package
g3176298,d5504431,February 22 2016,
g3176298,d5504431,February 20 2016,Our guild on the tour was so and knowledgeable and friendly I would highly recommend this trip. I always felt save and secure and had a memorial-able day. Thank you Alex.. ps I wish I would have written down some of your homoeopathic remedies.
g3176298,d5504431,February 19 2016,The staff here is amazing and the activities are save and fun. Great for team builders and big families.
g3176298,d5504431,February 18 2016,Weight limit didn't say til arrived at Park. Ended up doing short version then did Segway. Won't do this zipline again Segway fun
g3176298,d8854715,February 18 2016,
g3176298,d8854715,February 21 2016,It is nice I kept the pace between up and down mostly Up  the staff is very friendly and exquisite hospitality  Brand New with great atmosphere great for a fun-filled hours.It is a fun place it has a beautiful club with very good music.

g3176298,d8854715,February 8 2016,
g3176298,d8854715,February 8 2016,The dealers are terrible and somehow I think they are cheating in the Black Jack. I asked them to change the cards even though I was the first person they absolutley refused to do so.
g3176298,d8854715,February 8 2016,Free shuttel going back and forth and free entrance for players. Played a Texas Holdem poker tournament - free drinks when playing. Another man from my country said and complained to the game leader about some local players playing together with the dealers good eye! Nothing was ever done! The atmosphere was quite good but dealers spoke really bad English.
g3176298,d8854715,February 8 2016,Great I had a really good time. I am looking forward in going back. The dealers and personnel were very friendly
g3176298,d8854715,February 8 2016,the people working there are very joyful and helpful. Unlike the Hard Rock Casino we can play in Pesos (they are well equipped for pesos and USD) it's really new but the aircon is very high. I recommend to take a little jacket.

g488162,d147642,February 26 2016,
g488162,d147642,March 1 2016,I took a bus tour and this is one of the places they stopped at. There were vendors selling gifts outside where the bus stoppedand they sold water because it was very hot. Nothing special.
g488162,d147642,February 29 2016,We visited this chapel as one of our stops doing the ATV tour! This is such a beautiful little chapel on the island.
g488162,d147642,February 29 2016,What you see in pics is what's there. While I would not normally make a special trip to see something like this it was on the way we were going anyway so we stopped.
g488162,d147642,February 26 2016,The chapel is surrounded by gardens of cacti and close to the beach. The sanctuary inside the building is very lovely and the stone pews outside create a very scenic place for worship. Definitely a place to see while you are in Aruba.
g488162,d147642,February 26 2016,We visited the church as one of the stops on our UTV adventure. It's very pretty but we were dirty from 4 wheelin' all day and people were arriving to worship so we didn't go inside. The church overlooks a very beautiful area.
g488162,d147642,February 24 2016,If you have rented a vehicle this little church is worth stopping by. So adorable and well kept with years of history behind it.
g488162,d147642,February 22 2016,Visited the Alto Vista Chapel during the Action Adventures ATV Tour in January 2016. What a beautiful chapel! It's very small but very quaint and was a great place to learn a little of Aruba's history. I would recommend a short visit to this chapel.
g488162,d147642,February 22 2016,

g488162,d148728,February 22 2016,
g488162,d148728,February 22 2016,We have gone to Aruba annually for the past 27 years. The island is the safest friendliest Paradise to visit. The people are the most honest and highly educated in all the Caribbean.
g488162,d148728,February 22 2016,One of many wreck dives we did with Mermaid Dive Center. This is an easy shallow dive. Not as interesting as some of the other wrecks but okay for a second dive after one of the deep dives.
g488162,d148728,February 22 2016,I dove twice on this wreck site. It's a very easy and shallow dive excellent for beginners but still very nice for more experienced divers.
g488162,d148728,February 22 2016,We dove this on our discover Scuba trip and then again as one of our final checkout dives to get certified OW. There are better sites to see in my opinion and we haven't been back to this spot since being certified.
g488162,d148728,February 22 2016,
g488162,d148728,February 22 2016,
g488162,d148728,February 22 2016,We dove this wreck with Red Sail Sports. 25 feet down and the wreck is split into about four/five pieces. Bottom temp was about 70 degrees and visibility was about ten-fifteen feet with minor current. We spent about 40 minutes which was just enough time. I'd recommend this dive for any level diver.
g488162,d148728,February 22 2016,
g488162,d148728,February 22 2016,There are many wrecks to dive in Aruba. This was ok and had some interesting sea life but was limited. There are only 3 pieces remaining of the wreck since the bow and stern were salvaged.
g488162,d148728,February 22 2016,This is a great dive particularly if you are a beginner. Lots of color and sea life at a shallow depth. Because of the spread out nature of the barges there's plenty to see and each barge presents a whole new area to explore
g488162,d150321,February 17 2016,
g488162,d150321,February 17 2016,This beach in Aruba is absolutely gorgeous. Soft white sand and crystal clear blue water. It is located between the Divi and Tamarijn hotel. Chair rental is only 5 bucks if your staying elsewhere and that is very reasonable!! None of that gross seaweed to step on in the water either. Definitely worth the trip....you won't be sorry!!!
g488162,d150321,February 14 2016,Good swimming beach with amenities road access parking nearby all this stretch is clear water sandy beach and suitable for everyone.
g488162,d150321,February 11 2016,We stay on Druid Beach each time we visit Aruba it is a fairly calm area with a few waves when the wind really gets blowing.
g488162,d150321,February 11 2016,Nice beach not overcrowded with white sand and clear waters. Plenty of beach chairs and cabanas plus quite few bars where you can order your favorite piña colada
g488162,d150321,February 11 2016,This beach is absolutely stunning. The water can get a little rough but it is a nice quiet stretch of beach. No one walking around trying to get you to buy something just the sounds of the waves crashing.
g488162,d150321,February 11 2016,
g488162,d150321,February 11 2016,
g488162,d150321,February 11 2016,Our hotel was on Druif beach and we cannot recommend this beach enough. It was out of this world. Definitely one of the best beaches in Aruba which is also very quiet. If you want to relax and be away from the hustle and bustle of Palm beach then head here!
g488162,d150321,February 11 2016,Beautiful soft white sands with sparkling blue sea. Very clean and spacious. No beach vendors. 10/10
g488162,d150321,February 11 2016,We stayed at Divi Golf and the beach was close. It was easy to get chairs and palapas at any time of the day. The water is beautiful but a little more rough than Palm Beach. We enjoyed the fact that it wasn't busy. Beware: some topless sunbathers. Our kids were a little shocked but got used to it.
g488162,d150409,March 10 2016,
g488162,d150409,March 10 2016,Went here with a tour. The slippery rocks were hard to navigate gracefully. Once in the water was indeed cool. Not thrilled with the other folks/tour staff encouragement of jumping/diving off the rocks into the pool. Seemed like an accident waiting to happen and had a hard time convincing my kids they weren't jumping.
g488162,d150409,March 10 2016,
g488162,d150409,March 10 2016,To get here use a tour. The swim after our UTV ride was very refreshing. The entry and exiting of the natural pool is tricky and the tour operators will lend you a hand.
g488162,d150409,March 10 2016,
g488162,d150409,March 8 2016,
g488162,d150409,March 8 2016,
g488162,d150409,March 8 2016,We swam here on our ATV tour. It is located in the National Park and there is a cost but it was included in our tour. There are fish so bring snorkel gear if you have it. Steep steps down to the pool are tricky but the descent is worth it!!
g488162,d150409,March 6 2016,
g488162,d150409,March 5 2016,While it was pretty it was very small. It took over an hour to get to the pool while driving on high steep sharp rocks. I would not go again.
g488162,d150409,March 5 2016,
g488162,d151073,February 25 2016,
g488162,d151073,February 25 2016,This is a beautiful fairly remote part of the island but make the effort to get here. You will need to rent a car and be prepared to explore. The roads generally are not well marked but once you figure out your basic directions it;s easy. You are on an island and can't get lost for long.
g488162,d151073,February 25 2016,my advice is don't rent a Jeep for the week rent one for a day. Did the entire Eastern side in a day. Not much to see. It was sad to see all the trash on that side of the island. Wake up Aruba tourism is everything
g488162,d151073,February 22 2016,Loved the dunes. All dusty and dry. Can see clear out to the sea. It feels like you have been transported to the moon surface or somewhere far away. Lizards and cactus dot the landscape. awsome time.
g488162,d151073,February 16 2016,Given the diversity of Aruba we shouldn't have been surprised by the California dunes but we were! The pure white sand and size of the dunes amazed us. Great hiking.
g488162,d151073,February 11 2016,We came out here on a jeep tour and also on our own in our rented jeep I love it out here it is so different from the other side of the island. I really like stopping off and watching the waves crash against the rocks.
g488162,d151073,February 11 2016,
g488162,d151073,February 11 2016,Both below and on top you can take amazing photos. Sit on the shore for a while and look at the beautiful sunset
g488162,d151073,February 11 2016,Rent a jeep for a day. Georges is great. With a jeep you can go out and drive the whole island all along the shoreline and see everything there is to see.
g488162,d151073,February 11 2016,We parked and hiked in through the dunes and every so often you see massive rock formations in the midst of these huge dunes! The photography is awesome along the coral and volcanic shores just peppered with periwinkles of all colors!
g488162,d151073,February 11 2016,Interesting places along the way. We have a small SUV and not the best option. Travelling north from Eagle beach along the coast you will see the light house little chapel animal sanctuary and wishing rock garden. All places we found very interesting .
g488162,d2226058,March 6 2016,
g488162,d2226058,March 6 2016,
g488162,d2226058,March 6 2016,The snorkeling was awesome! This area is packed with wildlife. Definitely make an effort to go snorkeling earlier in the morning before tours and other visitors stir up and scare away the majority of the wildlife.
g488162,d2226058,March 5 2016,Clear calm waters with plentiful fish. Quite shallow so this is perfect for newer or hesitate snorkels. Nice afternoon
g488162,d2226058,February 27 2016,We went to Catalina Cove on Boca Catalina Beach and it was awesome. With a rock base the water is extremely clear and the fish were so plentiful we did not even need goggles to see them. The snorkling was excellent!
g488162,d2226058,February 25 2016,
g488162,d2226058,February 25 2016,small beach not very crowded. This is the best place to snorkel on the island. all the excursions bring their tours here to snorkel but it is an easy drive and you can go in right off the beach.
g488162,d2226058,February 22 2016,The beach is always what you make of it. Some snorkeling if you have your own gear and you can get a chair for 5.00. I'm surprised no one sells and snacks or water and there is no bathroom. Depending how the wind blows waves may be huge.. Better a day on the beach than a day in the snow.
g488162,d2226058,February 18 2016,
g488162,d2226058,February 17 2016,Very nice beach we visiting on our way from the lighthouse. Many different types of fish to see and very friendly locals!
g488162,d2226058,February 16 2016,Great spot to bring your snorkel & fins & see thousands of beautiful fish. We always go here at least once during our yearly stay on Aruba.
g488162,d2513634,March 8 2016,
g488162,d2513634,March 9 2016,A wildlife park which seems to have lost it's way. Very poor facilities very poor conditions for the animals - a depressing experience for the four of us. Really needs a total overhaul and starting form scratch. I don't like to give such a poor review but it's best avoided until it changes.
g488162,d2513634,March 8 2016,
g488162,d2513634,March 5 2016,The animals here are adorable and it is a wonderful experience. The goats are pretty tame and my husband was able to carry one around the entire park. There's a good variety of animals and it is really fun to feed them.
g488162,d2513634,March 3 2016,We enjoyed seeing all the animals that were rescued. The staff was very informative. It was fun feeding the animals too. There were more animals there than I thought. I would go back again.
g488162,d2513634,March 2 2016,Nice variety of animals. All seem quite happy. Great feeding experience. Cool deep toned monkey. Worth the $10 to keep this place going
g488162,d2513634,February 29 2016,we had the best day ever in Aruba as we got to explore the other side of Aruba. Our tour guide was Ludwig we had 4 Dune buggies going out that was our entire party. Ludwig was very informative and a pleasure to be around. The Natural Baths were gorgeous. all 8 of us would do it again
g488162,d2513634,February 28 2016,
g488162,d2513634,February 28 2016,Guide Alex was knowledgeable and interested which helped bring us closer to the experience bridging the distance between us and the animals in enclosures but everyone we encountered here was also great. Great for any animal lover not just for kids.
g488162,d2513634,February 27 2016,This place is amazing clean well maintained. We got to feed all the Aminals. They have a large variety horses goats snakes camels monkeys birds I sure I missed some. Our guide was great very knowledgeable about the animals. We spent a pleasant few hours there.
g488162,d2513634,February 25 2016,The zoo itself seems fairly well run. I just get upset seeing all these animals in cages with little to do purely to titillate a few American tourists. If you have never been to any kind of animal Park perhaps you will find this interesting but for the rest of us it is neither pleasant or particularly impressive.

g488162,d2513634,February 13 2016,We spotted a purple neck humming-bird (not part of the set up). Kids enjoyed feeding the animals. There are a lot of horses ponies donkeys macaws goats snakes camels kangaroos - essentially something worth visiting specially if you have kids.
g488162,d2513634,February 12 2016,
g488162,d2513634,February 11 2016,I wasn't expecting much at a zoo in Aruba. I was pleasantly surprised. So many different beautiful animals. Some were caged and some were loose. Gorgeous peacocks free roaming was quite a site. Offering nibbles to the animals was awesome and created wonderful photo opportunities. Fun for the whole family. I definitely recommend!
g488162,d2513634,February 11 2016,What a great place to visit and experience. It is a great cause that is run by a great man who truly has a passion for rescuing animals!
g488162,d2513634,February 10 2016,Yes go here. Its short but fulfilling feed the animals listen to their story. Monkeys camels emus horses goats donkeys reptiles and so much more. Plus its for a great cause!
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,Small zoo located in Alto Vista. Good selection of animals. You even get carrots and snacks to feed some of their animals.
g488162,d2513634,February 7 2016,We stopped as a part of the ARUBA jeep tour. The kids absolutely loved the animals and especially the opportunity to feed them. We learned about the snakes as well.
g488162,d2513634,February 7 2016,We toured Philip's Animal Sanctuary and found it to be a fun place to visit. The staff are very knowledgable and super friendly. They're doing great work caring for the animals who speak for themselves especially the howler monkey who really speaks for himself! A great way to spend time while visiting Aruba.
g488162,d2513634,February 7 2016,
g488162,d2513634,February 7 2016,So nice to see the variety of animals saved by this group. We were able to feed a good number of different species and view many others.
g488162,d2513634,February 6 2016,Rambo did a fantastic job on our UTV tour! He made the whole trip very enjoyable and fun! Defiantly would do it again! The natural pool was the best part of the whole trip!
g488162,d2513634,February 6 2016,
g488162,d2513634,February 5 2016,We enjoyed our visit to Phillip's very much. The animals are well taken care of and there is a large variety to see. We went as a group of adults and had a great time!
g488162,d2513634,February 5 2016,Toto and A.B did a fantastic job as tour guides for are group of 34. Would highly recommend taking this off road tour.
g488162,d2513634,February 5 2016,Great place to visit they have many more animals than we thought and some we didn't know existed. Everyone learned a ton about them the native species and the island in general. Quinton is a fantastic guide very friendly and incredibly knowledgable. Highly recommend. Great for the whole family.
g488162,d2513634,February 5 2016,
g488162,d2513634,February 5 2016,We love animals and we love to feed animals. Fun place to go and feed animals such as deer ewe goats alpacas horses pigs. Fun to watch monkeys and birds. Would spend maybe 1 hour there.
g488162,d2513634,February 5 2016,
g488162,d2513634,February 5 2016,It's a lot of fun to be able to feed the animals directly from your hand. Watch out for the red Shetland pony he bites if you stand too close and don't give him food.
g488162,d2513634,February 5 2016,
g488162,d2513634,February 5 2016,
g488162,d2513634,February 5 2016,Kids loved it. We brought extra carrots with us the 3 times we went. Phillip cuts the carrots for you and the goats horses and camels become your best friends. Very neat place.

g488162,d2513634,February 5 2016,
g488162,d2513634,February 5 2016,This is a great little zoo especially for younger children. Admission is 10 dollars and that includes a large bag of food to feed the animals. There is a nice variety of animals to see from peacocks to kangaroos. Many of the animals you can pet. There is also an area with baby animals. A fun two hours.
g488162,d2513634,February 5 2016,What a great way to support their efforts by visiting. Lots of different animals. They even give you food to feed the animals as well
g488162,d2513634,February 5 2016,
g488162,d2513634,February 5 2016,The was a fun stop in the beginning of our UTV tour with Around Aruba :) I held a baby goat and the dog was trying to bite its foot. It was soooo cute!
g488162,d2513634,February 5 2016,So many beautiful animals and all in great care and conditions. My young daughter loved the visit and the adults love it too. It gets very hot so wear lots of suncreen!
g488162,d2513634,February 5 2016,
g488162,d2513634,February 5 2016,
g488162,d2513634,February 5 2016,Had 10 of us plus an 8 month old. Toured the animal garden where there are rescued animals followed by an UTV tour of the coast. Also took a jeep with my granddaughter. Toto was our tour guide. He picked us up at the Hyatt. Outstanding day. Highly recommended. Thanks Toto.

g488162,d2513634,February 5 2016,This preserve is so beautiful. The animals seem well taken care of. We had a great time going through and learning how the animals arrived there.
g488162,d2513634,February 5 2016,
g488162,d2513634,February 5 2016,
g488162,d2513634,February 5 2016,This was a nice way to see the animals habitat in Aruba. The grounds were well kept. However reading the previous reviews I personally expected more. I guess it's just a matter of personal taste.
g488162,d2513634,February 5 2016,Philip's Animal Garden was a big hit with our kids (8-12 yrs). They loved feeding carrots and kibble to the goats donkeys camels and bunnies. My favorite were the baby capuchin monkeys who just love holding your hands and licking the fingers! This is not a zoo; it's a rescue center so please support their efforts by visiting them.

g488162,d4184723,February 15 2016,very small casino but nice. a little smoky in there. not good service on drinks and not a very large selection of machines
g488162,d4184723,February 15 2016,A good assortment of slot machines and table games. A full bar with entertainment completes the night.
g488162,d4184723,February 15 2016,We stay at lacabana so having a casino on site is great. Won some lost some but overall a fun place to be at. Free drinks and friendly staff.
g488162,d4184723,February 15 2016,The casino at the Lacabana resort was just opening when we left years ago. I was very surprised how nice is was. It had some fun slots.
g488162,d4184723,February 15 2016,
g488162,d4184723,February 15 2016,A small casino inside of the la cabana hotel. It has a lot of different slot machines. On a few nights a salsa band plays which was very good.
g488162,d4184723,February 15 2016,
g488162,d4184723,February 15 2016,Very handy to nearby resort hotels. I got lucky with Jackpots for the last two years. Good payouts. Only problem was on Bingo night. Players tie up many of the machines.

g488162,d8062195,February 12 2016,
g488162,d8062195,February 12 2016,Food was average... accommodations were fine. You have to walk to the beach but they have a nice pool with a waterfall onsite. To get any type of seating or hut at the beach you have to get there early because it's first come first served. Casino is small and smokey. Staff was pleasant and beds were very comfortable.
g488162,d8062195,February 12 2016,for a couple of years a regular visitor. Somehow the number of visitor is declining every month. Not nice to be the only player. But service is great then of course. nice variety of slotmachines
g488162,d8062195,February 12 2016,Best hamburgers on the island. In fact only restaurant that was open during a 5 hr Electrical blackout. Small payouts on slots.
g488162,d8062195,February 12 2016,Rosa help us check to a great room lots of up grades going on at the resort up dating 76 rooms two great pools one with a slide great place for families!
g488162,d8062195,February 12 2016,Visited this casino twice during our annual stay. At first it looked abandoned and empty. Very friendly staff and machines were fair and paid out. We won and saw many winners and a good reason to support this small casino if that is why you gamble.Hope they expand get more machines but stay as visitor friendly as they are now.
g488162,d8062195,February 12 2016,a very small and empty place a lots of penny slots the only good thing about this place was the cocktail lady kept bring us free drinks
g488162,d8062195,February 12 2016,Trop has a great time-share facility here. They are investing tons and each year improvements can be seen. The casino is redone but still small. The restaurant has been overhauled again too. All are improvements.

g488162,d8600678,February 29 2016,My husband and I were in Aruba in October 2015. We visited this church for Sunday mass in English. Such a beautiful church.
g488162,d8600678,February 10 2016,You will be so thankful that you stopped to visit this beautiful little church. We were fortunate enough to have come along with a person who was able to offer us the history of the building and the delightful story about how it came to be. Every single sight is beyond amazing!
g488162,d8600678,February 10 2016,Stop here and take pictures. Also visit the old cemetary. The setting in front of the statue makes for an excellent picture.

g488162,d8600678,February 10 2016,we happened by this church and cemetery and stopped and took a look. if your in the area it's worth a stop. They were having something in the church so we couldn't spend much time there. But we enjoyed exploring and it felt safe.
g488162,d8600678,February 10 2016,
g488162,d8765049,March 7 2016,
g488162,d8765049,March 7 2016,Service is good prices seem a little high. Food is very good. Nice atmosphere right on the beach nice to see the crystal clear blue water while you dine.
g488162,d8765049,March 1 2016,Awful. Food was horrible. We went there for super bowl with friends. No big screen... We ended up leaving after our food. We headed over to the Surf Club and watched it on the big screen. The food wasn't even close to being warm. My son said it was the worst meal he has ever eaten in Aruba.
g488162,d8765049,February 27 2016,This is a nice sandy beach for swimming and enjoying the great Aruba sunsets. There are lots of restaurants close by so plan to stay and have a meal on the beach.
g488162,d8765049,February 21 2016,We have come here for a number of years. This is a nice area to enjoy everything from the water etc. to just watching the setting sun. It is good for watching the fireworks on New Years Eve too.
g488162,d8765049,February 17 2016,This beach is right next to Palm beach next to Moomba beach. It is beautiful to sit here and watch the sun set. You can walk the beach and listen to the music coming from Moomba beach. The restaurant on this beach is amazing. It's called Hadicurari and has all good items on the menu and the seafood is amazing.
g488162,d8765049,February 14 2016,Another nice beach and dining option amongst many on this side of the island you can't really go wrong.
g488162,d8765049,February 14 2016,Great location on the beach. The Sunday night buffet is a good place to sample a variety of seafood diches

g616286,d555403,March 9 2016,
g616286,d555403,March 9 2016,This is a beautiful beach nestled between limestone cliffs. This is a spectacular place to even just stop by and see!. Walk along the cliffs and the views are stunning!
g616286,d555403,March 7 2016,Quiet and out of the way. Great beach to relax on. Not idea for swimming but you wouldn't be on an east coast beach for swimming!
g616286,d555403,March 7 2016,A cracking little beach is Bottom Bay! Not a lot else to say. Amazing little decent down the through the rocks to get there and then you are confronted with a beautifully picturesque beach flanked by cliffs looking out over the Atlantic.
g616286,d555403,March 5 2016,very pretty beach.calm water.paradise.nice local people hang out there.not pushy about selling their stuff.guys at entry have beer and drinks available. guys below sell jewlery and shells not pushy as well.nice day in all.

g616286,d555403,February 21 2016,We parked up on the cliff top and walked down the steps to our favourite beach on the island. Quiet and probably not that good for swimming but with the palm trees this feels like a real Caribbean beach
g616286,d555403,February 20 2016,
g616286,d555403,February 18 2016,Worth a trip out in your car to see stunning views. So relaxing a peaceful great place to take a cool bag full of banks and a homemade picnic

g652398,d2409040,February 22 2016,We walked along this sandy beach on our 1st morning in St Lucia its on the Atlantic side so there were Wind and Kite surfers out on the sea. White sands warm waters peace and tranquility. Several young men were clearing the beach of litter as we walked and swam off this beach.
g652398,d2409040,February 21 2016,
g652398,d2409040,February 20 2016,That's all that needs to be said about this gorgeous beach. The water is warm and it is patrolled by the local policia.
g652398,d2409040,February 20 2016,
g652398,d2409040,February 18 2016,Rarely do I get a chance to go to the beach while I travel. However I had the opportunity to pull up and have a relaxing lunch at the beach. The highlight was watching a young boy and his horse playing in the ocean. Classic.
g652398,d2409040,February 12 2016,Sandy beach is a great place to stop and take pictures of the Atlantic and up to the lighthouse. Unfortunately the beach it self is very full if weeds and the Atlantic water is very turbulent. It didn't seem safe to swim at all. It would be a great spot to kite board.
g652398,d2409040,February 5 2016,This beach is beautiful. This is our second year in St. Lucia and we stay at the beach. If you are a windsport enthusiast it is a must visit. My favorite spot in St. Lucia.
g652398,d2409040,February 5 2016,At weekends and holidays the area in front of the beach which has shade with trees becomes filled with cars and locals bringing their music and families to enjoy the beach. Still the beach is relatively empty. The swimming is good the sand is great.
g652398,d2409040,February 5 2016,We went the Maria Island and stopped by Sandy Beach. It was nicer than the sand on our beach because there was not much seaweed. There are shade from trees too!

g666611,d539138,February 20 2016,This beach was just across the road from our hotel we had free sunbeds rockley and Accra beach is the same place the beach gently shelves in to the sea were we spent a couple of hours dodging the waves would go back
g666611,d539138,February 18 2016,After snorkelling the reef a fair swim aay from the main beach went back to Oistins. The reef was better than expected the beach was very nice and very popular.
g666611,d539138,February 17 2016,A little more touristybut still a nice placeand very easy swimming in the shallow clear water.several places to eat and drink at reasonable pricesand large portions food wise.good for fish.

g666621,d4053401,March 9 2016,Really nice beach suitable for swimming. Also there are plenty of water sports you can take part of.
g666621,d4053401,March 8 2016,We walked over a few rocks then into the street for a few blocks. We swam in that lovely ocean and even saw a turtle.
g666621,d4053401,March 8 2016,Small section of the beaches on offer near the gap! Relatively quiet and can rent chairs out for 10bbd! Slice of heaven!
g666621,d4053401,March 8 2016,My wife and I got married here 10 years ago and revisited the Southern Palms Hotel to relive our happy day. Beautiful palm tree beach which we walked every day.
g666621,d4053401,March 7 2016,It's great for relaxing in the rental chairs or walking along the shore. Just beautiful to see white sand crystal blue waters..picture perfect
g666621,d4053401,March 7 2016,Beautiful clean fabulous sandy beach. Not overcrowded. No people selling. Our hotel was on the beach and most people if they want parasols go around the pool or under the palm trees so not jammed packed with people. Lovely to walk along this beach at eight in the morning when the temperature is around 28 degrees.

g666621,d4053401,March 6 2016,This has got to be the best 1000' stretch of beach in Barbados. The sand is white and is the texture of flour. The waves can be big on one side and swimmable on the other. The water is turquoise and warm and very clean and seethrough.
g666621,d4053401,March 4 2016,This beach is not a perfect swimming beach. The sea can be quite rough and the current very strong but it is more useable than you would first think. Because of the strong wind water sports can be limited and snorkelling is poor. However it is a beautiful beach with a nice cooling breeze and fabulous white sand.
g666621,d4053401,March 3 2016,
g666621,d4053401,March 2 2016,Take a walk and relax at this beach. It is marvelous! smooth sand and just a little surf. It is close to the Gap and has good access to restaurants and markets too
g666621,d4053401,March 2 2016,Fantastic beach - quiet and really surfy at the same time. Not a high rollers place but terrific little strip all the same. Love breakfast at happy days - they be great people as well as cooks. Good jerk available on the strip
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,We have spent many hours lounging in the sand and "bobbing" in the clear waters of Dover Beach. If there is a paradise on earth then it is on Dover Beach.
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,Lovely sandy beach with huge waves at times. Sea great for swimming in. Busy but peaceful . Loved it very much
g666621,d4053401,February 27 2016,Absolute paradise! Beautiful white sand and clear blue sea just like the pictures! Lovely beach bar and lots of other lovely bars nearby highly recommend xx
g666621,d4053401,February 27 2016,Use access via alley next to Walkers World quieter part of beach. Parasols and loungers available...at no cost when swimming at 4.00pm.
g666621,d4053401,February 27 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 27 2016,A wide clean beach occasionally a little breezy but shallow. Good for turtle spotting. Wind surfing & jet skis for hire but not a nuisance.
g666621,d4053401,February 26 2016,Everything was soooooo Beautiful! TAKE ME BACK. From the clear blue skies to blue beach chairs to blue waters I was totally left blutified......I will truly be back the next time I go to Barbados
g666621,d4053401,February 26 2016,Most people prefer to Bob up and down with the waves. Strong current in places. Most prefer to roast on loungers well sprayed with lotions.
g666621,d4053401,February 25 2016,Condo was located on Dover beach and it is the biggest and nicest beach I saw on the island.. Highly recommend a day trip or entire trip on this beach!
g666621,d4053401,February 25 2016,Nice beach with chairs to rent and plenty of places to eat but too crowded for me. Rather set at a bar and watch the waves.
g666621,d4053401,February 25 2016,The reason I say this is because the seas are very rough here and the white sand is gritty. Best beach is Caryle.
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,Stayed on Dover beach at southern palms A real nice beach white sand quite wide although water a bit rough plent of people swimming beach shacks for cheap eats and drinks
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,Not an area we visited after dark but when exploring during the day the area seemed pleasant.The shops were full of lovely presents for home and essentials for your holiday with lovely friendly people.
g666621,d4053401,February 23 2016,One of the beautiful beaches of Barbados! White sand transparent water easy to swimm a lttle surfing on one side clean good service of the beach boys.
g666621,d4053401,February 23 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 23 2016,Lively and lovely beach plenty of room for everyone whether playing football volleyball or just sunbathing. Nearby there are huts that serve drinks and snacks at a good price($10for 4 bottles of banks). I believe there is a washroom nearby too. Jet skis are also available.
g666621,d4053401,February 23 2016,I love this beach. Most say it's too touristy I disagree. It's full of fun & life! Great views & lots to do. Friendly locals & lots of little cafe's surrounding it. A must do :)
g666621,d4053401,February 22 2016,Just a paradise. Go there 6 AM and enjoy the paradise the smells the cool atmosphere ... It's just great.
g666621,d4053401,February 19 2016,Dover Beach at least in front of Sandals Barbados is quite rough because it is located on the Atlantic side of the island. Water activities are limited.
g666621,d4053401,February 18 2016,A beautiful position and great food had a lovely night there with friends and some red stuff. Try and book the tables nearest the sea on the top level.
g666621,d4053401,February 17 2016,We spent a day at this beach and loved it. The beach is protected in places by a break wall which makes for great swimming. There are a number of hotels located on the beach. We had a couple of drinks at the Lantern's bar and loved it. Now a must stop. we will be back.
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,The water was the right temperature it was okay for a lovers walk under the moon. the surrounding was great
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,Nice and easy I say you could visit throughout the day for a drink walk or even a swim. Open to the public with private locations. As I said before nice and easy.
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,Great beach very safe and fun. Get chairs from Kenny or Charles and enjoy the beautiful water. Food and drinks at the kiosks are fantastic. All the locals friendly and ready to provide any help. Don't forget to spend an evening in a casual unique environment food is way better than you might expect. Sunday evening karaoke is a blast.
g666621,d4053401,February 15 2016,We toured them all this one is clearly the best. Great sand water sports waves for body surfing clean and pleasant. Great nearby food options as well and not as pretentious as the west coast beaches
g666621,d4053401,February 14 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 14 2016,The water is gorgeous color but not as nice as some beaches on the west side. The waves are also a bit stronger which is beautiful but not as good for swimming and children although it's completely safe
g666621,d4053401,February 13 2016,Beach next to our hotel never too crowded and chairs and umbrellas available good swimming see turtles if you are lucky
g666621,d4053401,February 11 2016,loved dover beach soft white sand warm sea good beach bar people watching (which is a must) lounger and umbrella service great and not too expensive all in all an ideal way to sunbathe and spend days
g666621,d4053401,February 10 2016,Fine sand and rolling waves boogie board and wind surfing available. Nice beach for walking and relaxing with family
g666621,d4053401,February 9 2016,Stayed at Sandals Barbados and after reading the reviews before we arrived I was really worried. I needn't have been the beach might not be as good as those on the west coast but was beautiful white sand and a great breeze for the tan.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Love Dover Beach in The St. Lawrence Gap. Soft white sand turquoise water . Perfect. Bars on the beach close by. Can rent chairs and umbrellas if you wish
g666621,d4053401,February 6 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 5 2016,lovely beach lots of water sports and bars great place for holiday. Very safe place to swim and lots of turtles around
g666621,d4053401,February 5 2016,This beach stinks of rotten eggs especially after a rough sea that happen quite often in this part of Barbados (Atlantic)
g666621,d4053401,February 5 2016,Walked into St. Lawrence Gap along the ocean from the Barbados Beach Club. Cute tourist area with beautiful beaches but mainly restaurants cater to the evening crowd. Tourist type shops selling souvenirs. Found a nice bar Café Sol to enjoy a wonderful Margarita. An area to visit once!
g666621,d4053401,February 5 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 5 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 5 2016,Great beach with character that is lacking from other beaches along the island. Good for families and couples.
g666621,d4053401,February 5 2016,Just enjoying the surf jumping waves and there swimming next to us is a big ole sea turtle and then a few minutes later two more showed up. It was great.
g666621,d4053401,February 5 2016,Large clean beach with lots of loungers and people. I would prefer the quieter more secluded beach. Shops and bars close by.
g666621,d4053401,February 5 2016,Absolutely beautiful beach. Some big waves and a calmer area for swimming. White sand and an aqua sea!
g666621,d4053401,February 5 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 5 2016,Loved this beach and watching the turtles swim was just fab  always clean and never too busy and near such a lot of bars and restaurants.
g666621,d4053401,February 5 2016,One of the best if not the best beaches in Barbados. Water is turquoise and fairly calm. Great place for sunset pictures as well.
g666621,d4053401,February 5 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 5 2016,Great beach clean area beautiful scenery love the people over there  nice place to get just a drink and relax with the sun over you just all together great experience will be back as soon as i can get the time ..

g666621,d547318,March 10 2016,Really didn't like the gap thought it was to spaced out and not really much to see I would of like to have seen more shops but I would definitely recommend trying the reggia bus
g666621,d547318,March 8 2016,We stayed just on the main road opposite the gap and enjoyed all of our time here! Loads of little spots on the beaches to enjoy and all types of bars and restaurants for all types of budget! Would deffo recommend anyone to visit!
g666621,d547318,March 8 2016,We walked to the gap late afternoon my husband and daughter had stayed there a few years ago and said it was better early evening when places come to life. Having said that we still enjoyed it and would say it is worth visiting.
g666621,d547318,March 8 2016,
g666621,d547318,March 7 2016,We stayed in St Lawence Gap. This was our third time. Plenty of restaurant and bars. Can get a bit noisy late on but we never stayed up that long to be bothered by it. Seems to be a bit of an in place.
g666621,d547318,March 6 2016,We stayed in the Gap for a week. It has amazing beaches and great restaurants some of which are a bit pricey. The area is lively in the evening and fairly quiet during the day.
g666621,d547318,March 1 2016,When you leave Turtle Beach Resort you turns left. It's a nice walk. There are restaurants bars shops old church beach etc.
g666621,d547318,February 29 2016,Fun shopping and eateries. Nice local vibe. Very vibey nightlife but many are not directly on the water.
g666621,d547318,February 27 2016,My favourite place ever sheer paradise got married there this year ... Our dream coming back May 2016 xx
g666621,d547318,February 27 2016,The Gap is a section of Barbados off Highway 7. The gap has many small hotels restaurants and apartments. It is also home to Dover Beach one Barbados' best.
g8843616,d7266912,February 23 2016,
g8843616,d7266912,February 23 2016,This is an amazing experience run and organised by an amazing couple whose love of the ocean is spell binding !

g946307,d1230883,February 9 2016,
g946307,d1230883,February 9 2016,After a free taster session with Aruba Salsa at Bugaloe I booked a block of private lessons with them. They were fantastic. Very professional. I loved every minute of learning to dance with them and then practicing my new moves in their nightclub Club Hipsz. I would absolutely 100% recommend them to everyone.
