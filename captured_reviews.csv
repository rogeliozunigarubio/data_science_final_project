g147249,d148915,February 28 2016,Great beach very nice clear water. The fact that the water is shallow makes it also great for children. This is one which i do recommend others to visit.
g147249,d148915,February 27 2016,I love this beach because the water was the warmest anywhere on the island that we found. We did a lot snorkeling there as well. Beautiful fish. There are also areas of shade an event someone didn't want to spend all day in the Sun.
g147249,d148915,February 25 2016,This was my favorite beach in Aruba. The waves are big but not dangerous. My wife and I swam here for a couple of hours then ate lunch under a palapa. We watched two young kids at the beach slightly north of us surfing. This beach is not suitable for young children.
g147249,d148915,February 25 2016,much better beach then where the hotels are. Water is nicer and there is room on the beach. it is a stop on a lot of the bus tours so it can get a little crowded but just for the short stop they make.
g147249,d148915,February 25 2016,This looks like a good beach to snorkel. We didn't have snorkel stuff with us. We were disappointed that the snack bar and bathrooms were not open.

g147249,d148915,February 21 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 21 2016,This was the most beautiful calm water white sand swim out as far as you can standing for 40 feet out beach I have been to on this Island and we've visited a LOT. Shade for those that want it sandy bottom light wave water is the best. Do not miss this beach.
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,Its a drive from a hotel zone but definitely worth it. Water much more clearer than in Eagle Beach. Plenty of fish around you and there is always a friendly pelican fishing around you. Beware no facilities. Also one of the best sunsets on the Island.
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,I loved that beach we arrived very early like 8am and was very empty quiet and easy to find a cabin to let the stuffs. Have a good place to parking the car.
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,This beach is breath taking. The water is gorgeous. This beach is not too busy. Nothing much around so be sure to pack s cooler of drinks and snacks. We brought our own chairs but I do believe you can rent chairs if you want. This is s great place to spend your day.
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,Easy to get to just north of the high rises. Good parking and plenty of palapas for shade. This is probably the best snorkeling site on the island.
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,Such a beautiful beach! Nice sand and lovely colorful water! Plenty of free parking and no admission cost to the beach. There are nice cabanas to relax in the shade too. I'd suggest water shoes because there are lots of shells and rocks in places. Typically it's a good snorkeling spot but today there wasn't much to see.
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,Took a rental car from Eagle beach. Found out later that the local bus can take you there. Very nice and clean. $7 for a beach chair rental but 2 for $10. A short drive to the lighthouse. Ice cream vendor comes by with refreshments.
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,We had found this beach on our last visit and decided to go this time around. The snorkeling was very good with plenty of fish and Pelicans to see and take pictures of. We were there early and packed some beverages and snacks. This is a nice quiet place away from the high rise area. Will definitely go back.
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,Public parking is nearby to jump into the water and start snorkeling to see starfish octopus and all the great tropical fish. A few times a day the Jolly Pirates ship comes by blaring their music but they leave pretty quickly to return to peace and quiet.

g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,Beautiful view and plenty of shells. This beach is rocky though like many beaches on the island but worth the swim. Saw lots of Pelicans.
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,Found Arashi beach when looking for a place to snorkel. Great experience....crystal clear water and the ability to snorkel as well.
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,Nice little beach about halfway between the Marriott and California lighthouse. Gets pretty crowded in high season.
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,This was a very nice beach a little more quiet since it is up the coast away from the hotels and resorts. There were sections barricaded off where turtles had laid their eggs to protect them. Would be a great experience to came see them when they hatch.
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,You need to rent beach chair beach umbrellas pay parking. This is a beach more for young people. Beaches club the owner of this beach.

g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,Arashi Beach is a great sandy beach with gentle surf that is an excellent place to have a leisurely swim and lounge on the beach working on your tan!
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,If you like snorkeling here's where you should go even the snorkeling cruises make a pit stop at this beach. Less people than in palm beach. Only minus is that there's no toilets around.
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,This beach is just south of the California lighthouse. It has soft sand and the water has a little more movement than Palm or Eagle beach. There are chairs for rent here and a limited number of palapas so if you want shade get here early.
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,Smaller beach north of Palm beach plenty of fish for snorkeling. Looks like they are expanding the beach area & adding some facilities.
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,Great sand beach with shallower water you can walk out 150-200 feet before it's over your head. Beach is well suited for young families. Neatest thing about the beach is watching the pelicans dive into the water for fish Many boats in the area for snorkelling so has a beautiful view. My favourite beach in Aruba!
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,Beautiful beach and beautiful area of island north of high rise area. Excellent snorkeling and easy parking if you have a car rental (recommended)
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,Very pretty area near the Lighthouse. We only stop here for short visits while driving around the island.
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,Beautiful beach but not enough shade and no bathroom facilities. We stopped there for a quick dip but didn't stay as it was too hot and we couldn't get a palapa.
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,My favorite beach. Chair rental is available. Not at all crowded. Good area for snorkeling. Just the perfect beach!

g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,Great beach for sunning and swimming but not snorkeling. Huge diving birds were fascinating to watch.

g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,For us it was the best beach on the whole island. It's calm waters and rich underwater world is so nice and comfy. It's usually not really crowded not too deep. So everyone can enjoy. It's really close to California Lighthouse.
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,Great place to snorkel and just relax. Also enjoyed watching the pelicans and the terns diving for food. Only complaint is the bathrooms are not working
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,Each time we vacation in Aruba we visit this lovely beach! The water is beautiful and clean! This spot is a perfect for a picnic ! On weekends lots of locals seem to use this beach too. Don't skip this lovely beach!

g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,Arashi beach isnt as quiet nor exclusive as it use to be but its still a great break from yhe busy hotel beaches. And for only a short bus ride a great place. No amenities so bring a cooler.
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,By far our favorite beach. Tranquil waters with Pelicans and sea gulls diving for their fish among the people. Shoulder height water for quite a ways out. Plenty of parking. A fair number of palapas - often we shared the big ones. No unlocked facilities when we were there. Lounge chair rentals available.
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,The view is the best. It is near the light house and the restaurant that's next to it so if you wanna go there it is on the way
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,Great beach for both snorkeling and swimming. Away from the hotel/cruise ship drones with huge schools of fish. Nearby Boca Catalina has better snorkeling (and also worth a visit) but this place has both snorkeling and soft sands. Overall the best beach I've been to at Aruba.
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,A lovely off the beaten path beach! They have little hut for some shade that are free if you get there early enough and you can rent a lounge chair for 8$ per day. The best part it is right near an excellent snorkeling site!
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,This is the beach to go to for crystal clear water and less people if you go on a weekday. Amazing snorkeling water so clear you can see the bottom.
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,Hotel Beaches on Palm Beach are very crowded but the other non-hotel beaches are spacious and beautiful
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,Fantastic beach and great snorkelling.! Beautiful clear water and lots of room even on the weekends.
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,Calm waters and opportunities to snorkel. Also see lots of Pelicans who are not frightened of humans so get quite close just lovely.
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,Went here for a champagne toast on the kukunu konokoo party bus. It was a very nice and clean beach with an amazing sunset. Would love to return here on a future trip.
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,Stopped here a couple of times. The beach is a bit rocky but I did not think it was too bad. The kids were able to find some pretty sea shells here. It's Aruba. How can you find anything wrong with the beaches?
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,Perfect beach to snorkel with the kids we spent the entire day there and had an amazing experience!
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,This is to me one of the best beaches anywhere. .. The locals are a wonderful people and they keep this beach pristine. No ruff surf you can walk out and stay neck high all day. It's safe clean and all.. and from what I hear they are making a snak bar and bathrooms. Enjoy this treasure.
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,My wife spent the mornings on the beach while I dove. She found it to be clean and not too crowded. Plenty of things to do if you want or you can just sit back and read a good book.
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,We had a great time here. luckily we were a quick 2 minute drive to Arashi Beach and we were able to return a few time. Great beach great snorkeling. The beach & water is not rocky like other beaches.
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,Pos car perfect pictures!!! I would say go earlier in the morning to get that perfect picture before all the people come. Yet it is a wow beach for sure
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,Beautiful views everywhere and tons of seashell and coral hunting! Soft white sand and perfect for kids. Beautiful natural stones in some areas for great photos. My favorite beach so far!
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,Beautiful snorkleing! Some reefs farther out in the water and the ship wrecks are very neat if you have a boat to take you out to them. Snorkeling along the rocky coral wall edges is an experience I will not soon forget!
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,Great snorkel beach. Not too many tourist around when you avoid the times that the tourist boats get there.
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,Snorkeling is easy on this beach you don't have to swim very far out to see amazing fish! There are also tons of grass-thatched umbrellas on the beach. For the inexperienced snorkeler it is a lot of fun
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,We were there as part of a tour and the beach is beautiful. Crystal clear water and white sand. We went snorkeling in this area and we seen a bunch of white fish. Only this is there isn't a shower area to wash the salt water off of you.
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,Arashi beach is a nice quiet beach towards the north side of the island. We have done some great snorkling off of that beach and some of the best shelling collecting for the kids. The entry slopes a little but not too much. Worth a stop for an hour or two to enjoy the water and the snorkleing.
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,A good place to find shells. Not sure about the amenities. Took a cab from the Occidental for $12 and caught the bus (only comes by hourly) back.
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,I visited this beach last year and many things have changed so far some food trailers are parked there now some people have camping there clothes hanging on trees... resuming the scene much worst than a year ago.
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,My personal favorite beach white sand clear water not too crowded perfect in literally every way. Do yourself a favor and skip the crowds of Eagle Beach and take a ride over to Arashi. And grab some local food on your way back.
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,We loved the setting for this beach but the currents here were strong since is located at the end side of the Island the sea currents are the strongest not suitable for kids but nice for taking sun baths.
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,This beach is by far the best beach on Aruba. For $7 you can rent a chair and relax for the day. You can go really far out in the water and it's not deep. The beach has free parking and it's not ridiculously crowded.
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,Pretty little beach with very few people in the evening. We watched sunset from this beach our first night on the island.
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,very clean and popular beach for beach lovers.Stay away from the south end of beachthere's lots of rocks North end has better snorkeling conditions and you don't have to bang your feet against the rocks.
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,Beautiful beach one of the prettiest and intimate on the island. Good for singles or families and an easy walk from most of the Malmok area.
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,A great place to snorkel from the shore and calm for all to try if new to snorkeling. If you are lucky you will see turtles here as well as a wonderful variety of fish and eels.
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,The waters aren't as calm here but the sights are just as beautiful. While you're there stop by the California White house and the Yum Yum Truck. There you can find fresh cut coconuts fruit smoothies and snacks .
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,We went out there to see what other beaches were like. I like this beach because there were a range of different see animals we got to see. I didn't like that that Sand was very rocky and there wasn't a lot of seating
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,Not a very large beach water was nice just a few seating areas just a nice place to stop for a short time.
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,We went with our two young boys. We went thinking they would see a lot of fish. They saw a few fish but the rocks made wading around in the water uncomfortable. It also got a little crowded. It was just okay.
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,Arashi Beach was clean and quiet. Downside was no facilities. If you are staying within walking distance its worth the walk.
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,This is the nicest beach in the area to go! Small and very kids friendly... small waves to have fun! Beautiful sunset! My favorite!
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,My best friend and I took the bus from Eagle beach up to Arashi for the day and we were so glad we did. This beach is absolutely gorgeous with incredible views. You could see right through the water too. It's nice and quiet there and surrounded by beautiful houses and nature. Definitely a must for any Aruba go-er
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,We enjoyed a car ride along Arashi Beach to get to the California lighthouse. We saw homes that were owned by Whitney Houston and Will Smith.
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,I have snorkeled and am scuba certified and have never seen clarity in the water like I did at Arashi Beach. The surf was rocky but the snorkeling was perfect. No real beach or umbrellas truly just a snorkeling venture. I highly recommend it!
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,This is a pretty locals beach with sun umbrellas. We had a car so went here late afternoon for the sunset. It is beautiful. Water very nice. Snorkeling is good here too.
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,Is there a bad beach in Aruba? This beach was one of our favourites great to play in the water with the kids. The waves can pound a bit so if you have really young kids you will need to be really careful.
g147249,d148915,February 19 2016,Enjoyed this beach immensely! We stopped off here for some beach and snorkeling time after driving up to the Lighthouse. Google where the Snorkeling entry point is because it is not obvious (hint- go towards the left as you look from the Parking lot). Nice little beach which was not at all crowded!
g147249,d148915,February 18 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 18 2016,This beach is at the tip of the island. Pretty but the sand is not as smooth as other beaches. The water was clear though.
g147249,d148915,February 18 2016,We have visited a few of the islands beaches so far and Arashi has been our favorite. There is a huge sandbar in front that stretches out quite a ways. There are nice waves for the kids to play in and it was not crowded. We very much enjoyed ourselves.
g147249,d148915,February 17 2016,Loved it! Beach chairs and umbrellas for rent. Also has Palapas (huts) and one designed for handicap! Lots of palm trees! Bring your cooler and snorkel gear and you are set!
g147249,d148915,February 17 2016,Secluded and very private. Safe for kids and adults. Pictures beach but without any facilities. Great for a couple of hours if you have a car....but you can not have a good holidays on Aruba without a car anyway!
g147249,d148915,February 16 2016,Very convenient as are all Aruba beaches. Parking free as is typical. Snorkel right off the beach. No real services but worth a half day at least.
g147249,d148915,February 16 2016,Awesome quiet beach with few huts and couple of miles away from High Rise so most people who come here are locals or tourists staying in-land. Bathrooms were locked in the morning so not sure if there are any restrooms.
g147249,d148915,February 15 2016,There are several large huts for shade and restrooms. Beach chairs are available for rent. There is also ample parking and a wheelchair accessible hut.
g147249,d148915,February 15 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,Good location at top of the island car park shallow sandy beach various sun cover and lounger options does not have the food and drink options the more crowded and popular beaches have.
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,This beach is a little remote in comparison to the main beaches in Aruba but it is well worth the visit. The beach is nice and a lot less crowded than the other beaches on the island. Definitely a must see
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,Arachi Beach is my favorite Beach on Aruba it is more a local beach the water is very clean and there are often some waves. It is very romantic Guests of Sunflower Villa got married there under a dividivi tree.
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,Beautiful beach! We spent time in the sun and enjoyed every minute of it. It's definitely a "must see"!
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,We prefer going to Arashi Beach as there are mostly locals there. People are always about sharing their palapa and the swimming and snorkelling is great! Lots of families and great Latin music usually playing somewhere. Lots of parking. Clean Beach.
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,Www.fulltankofgasblog.com 5 things I did in Aruba. Great place to snorkel! Lots of boats stop here but are a little further out. We drove and didn't have any problems.
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,So lovely away from the crowds. Great snorkeling relaxing beach. If you have the opportunity to go here do so! I love Aruba and Arashi
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,Nice but not my favorite. Great sunsets. Beach is a bit narrow and can get crowded. I find the sand here not as fine and white as other beaches.
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,They are building on to this public beach a bathroom area and a food stand.Snorkeling is perfect and my daughter loves the icee at the icecream truck
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,Best beaches on Aruba with beautiful white sand and crystal clear water. Arashi reef is a good place to snorkel.
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,Great beach if you want to be away from the crowds and definitely much more interesting than Palm Beach ;)
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,Arashi is the place to snorkel. All of the snorkel tours stop there. There are many colorful fish and lots of coral varieties as well.
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,This maybe the best spot on the island to watch the sunset. It is spectacular! Add in a nice area to swim and snorkel and it is one of hidden gems on Aruba.
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,Just up the road from the main hotel area & great for snorkling. Lovely place for a vow renewal as well.
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,Great place to snorkel and not a crowded beach. Very windy though. You can just rent snorkel gear and make a day out of it.
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,Nothing much to see here but the dunes and the odd bird however hire a dune buggy and see some more of the beach

g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,This is one of the best beaches on the island. Crystal clear water. Pelicans diving. loads of fish Snorkeling areas. Great diversion from the resort beaches.
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,This is one of the few beaches that lets you access the water from the sand. The water will be clear. The nearby reef is a quarter mile out but quite dead.
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,My fiancé and I lived Aruba from 2012 - 2014 and one of our favorite things to do was to drive to Arashi run up the lighthouse and back then go for a swim and snorkel! Calm waters soft sand and the snorkeling is wonderful! Get there early if you want a plapa!
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,no shade but lots of underwater sights bring goggles  great snorkeling make sure you have your water shoes bring coverup there's little to no shade for sensitive skin
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,Attended a wedding reception there..the beach is beautiful clean not crowded. Went looking for shells and found some cute ones with many colors and sizes.
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,the water was beautiful clear and the area was quiet. we found it to be more of a local's beach but relatively quiet the days we visited
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,We drove there ourselves and saw a lot of sea life just a short distance out and around the bend to the left. Several tours brought people to the exact same spot for à hefty fee. Great beach for families. Water clear and calm for little swimmers. No bathrooms. No vendors. Ice cream truck came by.
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,We were told that this was a great beach for snorkeling. We saw a couple of fish and that was it. There are some pretty rocks and its a nice view.
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,They have a lot of pallapas to sit under. The beach is beautiful. A good place to swim and snorkel if the waves aren't too rough. They are in the midst of building new bathrooms etc.
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,Calm waves and nice sand. Great place to wade in the water as it doesn't get too deep too quick. We went out snorkeling quite far and didn't see much at all.
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,Some of the best views on the whole island are right here. We came up here to Arashi looking for a geocache and wound up spending at least an hour just walking around and taking pictures. This is the stuff you see on postcards. Just amazing.
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,snorkel off to the far left. Saw snowflake eel squids and lots of fish. they are building a what looks to be new bathroom. only downfall is no food here pack a cooler
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,The water is clear and full of fishes. The only down thing is that to enter in the water you have to pass through some stones or gravel. If you are staying at Eagle or Palm Beach it pretty the same thing...
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,Drove up to Arashi beach last visit and went snorkeling off the beach. Lots of fish and not very crowded with people. Great quick trip from the Marriott Ocean Club.
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,My favorite spot on the island the water is clear and the snorkeling is quick swim from the shore. Many little sub-beaches north of Arashi are less crowded but nowhere north of Arashi has any shade so putting up with a few more people is worth it.
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,Nice beach clear water soft sand. The best snorkeling nearby is to swim south from this beach but this is a great place to swim. Parking was easy.
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,This beach is near the California Lighthouse. The water is shallow for quite a way's out. Beautiful long beach- perfect for a stroll. Lots of parking but not too many people.
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,A beautiful Beach! There are chickie huts to get out of the sun- the water was so beautiful and snorkling was also awesome. A must to see and experience in Aruba!
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,Nice spot for later in the day to snorkel relax on the beach. It seems popular with the locals. No services but then who really needs much at the beach? It is a respite from the resort beaches and crowds.
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,Great beach! Convenient and free parking. Nice clean sand with beautiful snorkeling (we brought our gear and snorkeled for free as the catamaran tours were right in the same location) and great sunset. It's pretty hard on your feet so definitely bring your water shoes.
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,This beach is nice for snorkeling compared to Palm or Eagle. There are more shells here and you can rent beach chairs. The bus comes every hour and it is "close' to the lighthouse you can walk it but it is a distance.
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,Perfect local beach by the light house. Good spot to head in if you want some beginner snorkeling from the beach. Always clean safe and friendly.
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,They are building restrooms but it may be a while. The beach it self is very nice and the surf is not too rough. Good place to spend a few hours but take it easy on the food and drinks till they get the facilities done.
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,Beautiful beach but you'll need transportation to get there and your own snorkeling equiptment. But it appears that they are putting in restrooms and maybe rentals!
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,super waves and not dangerous at all for young and old to enjoy the crystal turquoise waters snorkelling in a tranquility way
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,PERFECT FOR US! As our house was right there. It's been windy so far but the beach is breathtaking.
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,This is in the far northeast side of the island and is reasonably good for snorkeling as well as swimming. No facilities that I recall.
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,We enjoyed Arashi Beach as it was one of the less crowded beaches. We ended up at the very end of the beach toward the tip of the island and enjoyed the views. Be care of the sea urchins.We found 2 while walking along the shore. Nice place to relax on the beach.
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,Great beach without the crowds. There are a few huts which you can get if you arrive early. Beach chairs are available for $7 each. Snorkeling is okay. Not extremely colorful but I spotted a pretty cool flounder that was in the sand. I suggest you come down here if you are in the high rises.
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,this was the best beach for sitting and relaxing as well as snorkeling. There is easy parking lots of covered areas to sit chairs to rent and really smooth white sand.
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,Went there by boat - trip that visited Arashi beach and "The Antilla" for snorkeling. Great to do some snorkeling. Crystal clear water great fauna.
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,Nice sandy beach and you will enjoy swimming in the ocean. The water was a perfect temperature. Best snorkelling there as well. Needs washrooms shower to rinse off and a snack bar
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,This beach is less crowded and it's a great spot for snorkeling or just relaxing. The water is clam and very clear.
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,Nice Beach! Easy access to get into the water. We snorkeled here saw a lot of fish. Bring your flippers will make it easier to cover more area. I didn't have mine and it was a little harder coming back in. You can rent lounge chairs $ 5.00 well worth it.
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,This beach always seems to be overly crowded. We tried 2 days in a row and had no luck. Boca Catalina is down the way and has great snorkeling. But don't plan your day for a lounge chair and palapa.
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,Less crowded than beaches along the hotel strip and less than a 10 minute drive (or you can take the bus). Make sure you being snacks and anything else you need since there are no shops.
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,Away from the hustle and bustle that surrounds the highrise hotels and Eagle/Palm Beach. This is a nice little beach gem. I spent most of my time at this beach!
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,I'm not sure why but this beach always felt deserted. It was beautiful and close to where we were staying. It had a nice long stretch that you could walk.
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,A local's beach...beautiful lounge chairs available. Beautiful white sand. December it's a bit rough and we got wet just walking the beach but it's beautiful and worth a trip. Parking is ample if you have a car. Pack your own cooler.
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,This was a beautiful beach we visited while touring Aruba. It was very clean and quiet. Nice trees to lay under for shade
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,Crystal blue water white sand and far away from the noise of the resorts. Wonderful beach experience.
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,Away from all the craziness of the resorts your own piece of paradise. Lots of beach front beautiful water and those divi trees that you can use for shade. One downside-no restrooms.
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,This beach seemed rockier than palm and eagle with a steeper drop off.There is a man who rents chairs and unbrellas there. The cost is around 40.00 for two chairs and umbrella.Plenty of parking
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,I had originally gone to Arashi to snorkel but a storm was coming in and it was too windy and the waves were too big to do so. Still I had an excellent time swimming in the waves and watching surfers have fun. And even with the gray skies the beach looked amazing. Great place!
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,Near Califórnia lighthouse there is one of the best beaches of Aruba. It's small but it's perfect to relax and snorkel in its cristaline and calm water like swimming pool. There's no resorts restaurants or toillets. It' necessary to bring your beverages and food there but I really love it! It's better arriving earlier . Few public "palacas" for everyone.
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,This beach is beautiful great for swimming and there is plenty of shade in the palapas. There are no facilities but the ice cream truck usually makes a stop and there is usually a soda truck as well. Chair rentals are only $5.
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,views of nature instead of hotels there is a little truck that sells water and juices free parking calm water there are people renting chairs and umbrellas if you don't bring your own.
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,Great off shore snorkeling. Shade from trees and palapas if you want. Far enough way from resorts to avoid crowds but still a quick drive to get to.
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,beautiful beach and very close to reefs for excellent snorkeling - can start right from the southern part of the beach.
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,lots of palappas but know its very popular so they go fast  chairs are for rent there so bring towels to sit on ...to the right of the beach is rocky but very private ....lol
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,If you don't like the busyness of the main beaches Arashi offers the ability to see one the "local hangouts". Still pretty busy but not as crazy as the resort scene.
g147249,d148915,February 12 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 12 2016,Beautiful beach with chairs for purchase and umbrellas. Easy parking. Only downfall was no plAce to buy food or drink. Very nice
g147249,d148915,February 9 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,A really beautiful beach that is also good for snorkeling. It is to bad that the bath house that was built is not open.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Making arashi beach larger for swimmers also. Beautiful spot to watch kite surfers sunsets and snorkelling
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Really enjoyed this tranquil beach away from the High Rise crowds. Great place to snorkel and watch pelicans fish.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,We've been watching construction here going on for a couple years. It looks like they may have rest rooms. A rarity on Aruban beaches. Everything was locked when we went. A nice beach with parking area. Enjoy the beach without hotels in the background.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Great beach. Stopped in to be in a very swimmable serene beach with ambiance. Caught bus after and it wasn't a long wait. Nice blend of light waves and calm clear waters.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Get there by 10 am to get a palapa far less crowded than the other beaches. No facilities. Rocky getting in and out of the water but some of the best off shore snorkeling on the island. Good for finding shells and sea glass and the peace and quiet made it our "go-to" beach.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,This beach is less crowded than others which is super nice. There are a few shade trees if you are lucky enough to nab one otherwise plenty of space to put your chairs or towels. The snorkeling is ok most of the coral is dead but the beach is clean & the water simply beautiful.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,If your in Aruba and want to save some money take the bus from the cruise ships! You can snorkel right from shore -- all the tours come here! There are no chairs or bathrooms buts it's very safe to let your things on the beach! We have been here many times! you don't need to buy a tour !
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,A few minutes drive north of Eagle Beach. Nice sand on the beach but a few more rocks in the surf. Otherwise more secluded for couples.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,This was one of the prettiest beaches on the island and it wasn't super crowded. Water is the most beautiful Caribbean blue I've ever seen.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Close to our hotel. Could walk there if you don't mind the heat. Took us about a half hour from Boardwalk hotel.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,We enjoyed bobbing in the gentle waves a bit of snorkeling and a lot of full-on relaxing. This picturesque beach wasn't crowded was clean and easily accessible.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,If you want to get away from the crowds this is the place! This is on the way to the lighthouse. The sand is amazing. There are a couple of cabanas there but they are first come first serve.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,the water and beach is lovely here but it's quite small area wise. some shade and loungers but no toilets or eaterys. Bus goes into car park and is regular too.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Good access with car clean and peaceful. Direct access to a nice reef and snorkeling. many chances to see turtles.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,One of my favorite beach in Aruba......nice and quiet clear water close to California lighthouse. Perfect for families or group of friends :)
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Great place to watch the kite surfers and wind surfers you can also rent equipment and take lessons.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,We enjoyed our time here and it is close to the Lighthouse with a nice view of the island. We were a little disappointed there were no places to change and no rest rooms but for the island it was probably one of the best beaches. Don't waste the time going to Baby Beach.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Quite the experience to be swimming in the ocean and looking at cactus at the same time! There are chairs and umbrellas to rent if shade is not available. An ice cream truck came by during our visit! No restroom facilities though.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Clear visibility. A great snorkeling dive to see lots of fish. Not deep at all. We got to this site via a catamaran of De Palm Tours.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Arashi beach is a small beach with convenient parking and access. It's all about the snorkeling here so don't forget your gear. The coral and fish are abundant- you don't have to swim far. Arashi is definitely the spot for snorkeling but go somewhere else if you're looking to just lounge and tan.

g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Went to this beach to snorkel.It can be accessed by car or by talking the bus.Just a few hours for shadebut the fish are plentiful.Make sure you take an underwater camera.Not very crowded and very pretty
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,As a matter of principle do not rent chairs or an umbrella at this beach. He shows up and targets people sitting in the huts he wants for chair rentals- bullying them people until they move.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,this beach was beautiful a little rocky and grassy for me..the pelicans were fun to watch..it also would be nice if they had bathrooms.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,My husband and I really enjoyed snorkeling at Arashi Beach. We rented a car for the day and it was an easy drive from the low rise hotel area. Great views all around as you see the ocean and the California lighthouse is behind you!
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Arashi is pretty plain the beach is not as nice the snorkeling off the beach though is great. There are a lot of rocks so it's not a place to go unless you have snorkel gear and water shoes
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,This is a wonderful beach in Aruba. But take verything you need because there are few facilities there. There is no bar or restaurantes sending food and beverages.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Just went to spend the afternoon of our first day in aruba and what a great choice. Warm cool water not so crowd beautiful calm water and clean smooth sand. Went back couple times!
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Large soft sand beach. Water is shallow and adults can easily walk about 100 yards. Very low waves so great for kids.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,This was my fourth trip to Aruba but my first to Arashi. My sister recommended it after her last trip and she was right! It had just enough waves to enjoy but not get clobbered. The pelicans were a blast to watch- they would dive bomb for fish 5 feet from a person! It was very entertaining. Love this beach.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Arashi is the nicest beach I have ever visited. The water is crystal clear and may be dead calm or there may be some nice rolling waves for your bogey board. It is rarely crowded and the mix of people there is always fun. Water temperatures are low 80's most of the year. Don't miss this!
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,This beach is near the light house. It has a lot of rocks/shells so---if you go there you might want to wear swim shoes. There is lounge chairs for rent little in shade structures. If you want to snokel it does have small reefs where fish hide.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,We went to this beach in search of a good snorkeling area - we were not disappointed ! Millions of fish - clear water - what a great location ! Highly recommend !
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,We definitely thought this area of the island was some of the better snorkeling. There were not many people and had easy access to the water from where we parked our car.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Nice place for snorkeling and relaxing for the afternoon. No amenities so bring enough water (or beer if you prefer) to drink!
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Nice quiet beach with great water and good snorkeling on calm days! Tranquil beach when you want to get away from more crowded Palm Beach area.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Great place to snorkel. We seen more marine life there than any other place that we had snorkeled. Clear beautiful water beautiful fish
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Aruba does not have too many places for snorkeling but Arashi beach is a very good spot. Many fishes and sea stars can be seen It has a wide area for snorkeling and definitively you'll enjoy it.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,This was the most beautiful beach Crystal clear turquoise water and decent snorkeling. Would got to this beach again for sure
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,We stopped here to take photos as the mobile I love Aruba sign was located here. The beach is beautiful here and the water clear. This is where the wind surfers are so it is quite windy.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,loved this snorkel spot. So much to see snorkeled too long and got a red bottom. use the sun screen!!
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,save right off the beach tons of various fish and you don't need a tour or a life jacket flippers and the snorkel are fine. Free parking! Love that snorkeling area!
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Beautiful beach. Very clean with nice tiki umbrellas to protect from the sun. Beautiful blue water and far enough from the road that no road noise was heard.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Perfect!!! Soft sand clean... Close to downtown... Near California Lighthouse. You can surf there too !!!
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Clean beach with some palapas for shade. Water is shallow enough for kids and there enough rocks for decent snorkelling. Be aware that there are no bathrooms so pack some TP for the kids.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,I love this beach. I thought the water here was clearer & cleaner. The beaches in Aruba does not seem to get too crowded but it looks like this a favorite. I'm only giving 4 stars for now as we did not get to stay long to do some snorkeling. However I will come back here next time.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Could have had better snorkeling if the winds had been calmer. We were disappointed as this beach has had better reviews. Just depends on the weather.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Somewhat secluded. One of my favorite beaches in aruba. In some areas of the beach you can snorkel I have not do it but I have seen people. Maybe by the rocky area there are fish to see.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,This beach is quite small and it's ok but you do not get a lot of fish for snorkeling. It also has a lot of little rocks in the sand. If you want to snorkeling head over to Boca Catalina (right next to this one!)
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Beautiful beach. Peaceful setting. Beautiful calm waters. You can rent chairs . Palapas are also available.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,It' a marvellous beach that is safe from the enormous resort of Aruba the water is clear and atmosphere is caribbean
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,The beach has crystal clear waters and the sand is just soft and white. Must get early to get a spot and there is no service on site for food or water.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,I love it ...so relaxing just laying out and watch the people around having a great time... took a lot of random picture.... my wife and I enjoyed it so much that we will definitely come back and do more snorkeling and relaxing.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,This beach is popular with Arubans and for good reason. It is gorgeous and the water is crystal clear. In the background you see the light house. You can rent a chaise lounge and there is usually an ice cream truck parked there.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Arashi Beach is very nice. Less crowded than the big Palm/Eagle Beach area and also great for snorkeling.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Aruba for a day .. Rented Jeep and went around the island .. Arashi was my favorite beating out baby beach and Eagle
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,snorkeling from the beach gentle surf not over crowed scenic. Not much shade available. The bus will take you here but not super reliable.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,We had Aruban's tell us where to enter without going on the rocks. We stayed in the water untill dusk. A beautiful day trip!
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Not much to speak of as an actual beach but once in the water wow...sea life abounds! Take towels and a cooler with cold drinks because it's very hot and no vendors/stores around to get your hydration.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,This is the ideal place to start snorkeling (no rocks to hurt your feet) and swim to Boca Catalina. We have seen gorgeos fish there
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,very easy access by local bus ($ 2.50 per person ) fantastic snorkeling place lots of different fish  shallow coral reef
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Fabulous snorkelling loads of interesting fish life and loads of star fish. Go with Depalm tours on the catamaran
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Aruba has such a variety of beach experiences. Arashi has soft white sand great for swimming and sun bathing. There were huts available for shelter which was nice on hot sunny days. There was great snorkeling near the rock formations just to the left of Arashi beach.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Great beach and fun to travel to the top of the Island! Chill atmosphere great snorkeling calm and clear water and both tourists and locals enjoying together.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Great beach for the family. We took some great pictures here at sunset and the came back for a beach day
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Great beach!! Sandy shallow water. Clear water. Nothing to dislike. If you like semi-private without huge hotel crowds this it it.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,what a fantastic little beach my wife and i visit every may totally un spoilt with a few shades there is rarely more than 50 people on this beach (bar weekend ) which is maybe half amile long. the central part you can walk out 100 metres and still be chest deep
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,beautiful carib beach...in residential area with few crowds generally...however no amenities whatsoever not even a porti-potty. need a car or must walk a few hundred yards from bus stop. limited shade.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,This is a beautiful beach. No amenities but they are a few palapas if you're fortunate enough to snag one when you're there. I wasn't impressed with the snorkeling (the water was kind of cloudy). But the water and beach was beautiful and I'm glad we went to see Arashi. It's definitely worth a stop if you're exploring the island.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Quite windy on our last visit. We got sand blasted. But it's not crowded like Palm Beach. It's a nice stop to or from the California Light House.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,If you are looking for a beach with little to do or just very calm waters this is your beach. Gorgeous water quiet setting is all here for you.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Great for snorkeling without having to pay for an expensive tour. No restroom facilities or food but if you prepare ahead of time you can bring drinks and sandwiches. This is a public beach so you have to get there early to get a palapa for shade.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Awesome place to rest and spend a day but there are no services around so you must take everything you will need during the day.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Small beacharea never crowded as opposed to the major beaches around the big hotels. Close to the California Lighthouse and the tip of the island.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,beautiful beach and really near to the california lighthouse is far from almost any hotel have a near parking lot
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Out of all the beaches in Aruba this one was my kids favorite. They love to boogie board & this was one of the best places for it that didn't have a "do not swim" sign. The water was clear and beautiful!
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,This beach was. A short bus or taxi ride but well worth it fabulous beach and great for snorkelling you could snorkel from the beach same place the trips take you
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,This was on the north part of the island away from the crowded beaches by the hotels. We brought our own snorkel gear and had a blast. Starfish anchovies blue trumpetfish and many other fish were plentiful.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Great beach for watching birds dive for their dinner great snorkeling to left just look for catamaran tied off shore! Wonderful soft cool sand! Great for all ages can get rough at times! Get there before 10 am if you want shade! They do rent lounge chairs!
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,I was taken here by an island tour for a brief amount of time and it wasn't as crowded as most of the other beaches. The water was a bit rough but nice and warm. There were several shaded posts to nestle your belongings by while you take a dip. I mostly enjoyed the island's Divi trees on the shore!
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,A very good beach for swimmingsnorkelling and shallow beach dives as well as for just sitting and soaking up the sun .
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Easy to get to park close to the water nice sandy beach not crowded gradual water slope public free public Palm umbrellas and fairly clean. Exposed to constant wind but so is most beaches.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Nice beach- plenty of room for sunbathing and swimming. No waves although I recommend beach shoes for going into the water due to shells and shifting sands - really helps getting in and out!
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Water was shallow and clear. Plenty of silver fish swimming around. $5 chair rentals and a few shaded tables but they fill up quick.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,We loved going to Arashi Beach.. It is very quiet. They have big kiosks and since there is not a lot of people we just put our things in the kiosk and head to the ocean. Water is beautiful and ocean is very calm.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Like all beaches on Aruba Arashi is very accessible and hugged by turquoise waters. Shore is swimmer friendly but if you want to see something interesting snorkeling you have to swim up a little further and for weak swimmers like me all I saw was mostly choppy water. I enjoyed it anyway.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Get away from your calm serene hotel pools and beaches and head up north for amazing little spot that is much more natural. Bring your snorkel gear.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Good parking. Bus drop off & pickup. Chair rentals and free palapas. Great view of California Lighthouse. Refreshments for purchase. Calm waters for swimming and entry for snorkeling
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Nice beach to relax not very crowded. Just south of there is a good snorkeling area. There's usually a pirate ship anchoring near by with tourists on board for snorkeling.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,We came up to Arashi Beach on our last full day in Aruba to finally do some snorkeling. Didn't look like much at first but when we got over the scattered rock fields there were fish all over. Plenty of parking nice white sand not crowded...nice!
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,We went there to take photographs one morning and it is a pristine beach with very little traffic. Locals say the snorkeling is very good too.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,We enjoyed our time spent here. The beach has a little something for everybody. We snorkeled and sat in the sun a while. The parking is easy in and out. *There are no facilities here.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Quiet beach away from all the hotels. There are huts for shade but they rent the chairs so just take a towel.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,We went there several times and each time we had a nice time. The main advantage is that its not so crowded more local and far from the mainstream hotels and tourists. Nice sand. Fully recommended.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,try and get here early so you can get an umbrella stand. The snorkeling is pretty good right from the shore and not too deep. It was easy for the kids to snorkel
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,great for snorkling love the area not far fromPalm beach we would walk from the Holiday Inn if you are into walking
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Rent a chair for $5. Limited shade so wear sun block.Snorkeling is fair. On the road from The Lighthouse. There is a small spot to buy pop. Much quieter than Palm Brach and eagle Beach.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,If you like snorkeling. It's one of the best places to practice. Lot of fishes. It's like and accuarium!
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Just north of the major hotels and excellent location for snorkeling. Snorkeling is easily accessible right from the beach.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Great for snorkeling and playing in the big waves when they come in. Lots of locals to talk with. Situated at the north end near the lighthouse. Short jeep ride from the strip. My son's favorite beach.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,This was close to where we stayed and was for us the best beach because it wasn't crowded at all parking was free and easy and the view of the lighthouse from the water was spectacular!
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Not crowded plenty of room and great place to take a dip hang out in the water and do a little bit of snorkeling!
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,If all you want to do is sit on the beach probably could just sit at the beach at your hotel. If you want to snorkel start here and head south along the coast.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Everytime we visit Aruba we make sure we go to Arashi Beach to snorkel. Clear waters great fish and sea life. Great for beginner snorkels as well as advanced.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Nice beach soft white sand. No facilities lots of parking. Some shade. Nice and quiet away from hotels and water sports.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Ara shi Beach and Boca Catalina have excellent snorkeling spots with all kind of small and larger fishes starfishes etc.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,The day we visited the waves were rolling in not good for snorkeling. That said this is a very nice beach for swimming and accessible by bus. Had a snack truck which is always nice.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Absolutely perfect beach. Clear water nice sand they rent chairs and there was a truck selling snacks and ice cream.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Arashi is as nice public beach with a fair number of palapas for use. It is a nice sandy beach with some rock and coral at both ends but there is large area for swimming. The water is calm and shallow for a long distance.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Arashi Beach is a nice beach away from the crowds especially the cruise ship circuit that usually heads straight for Eagle or Pam Beach. It's a quiet beach that is smaller than the more popular beaches but is great for relaxing and soaking in the sun.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Great little spot for some snorkeling. Chairs are available and the snorkeling is decent. Drift south along the reef and you'll see a decent amount of marine life.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Great sandy beach with thatched huts for shade. Don't be scared to ask to share with others....everyone is really friendly. There is a guy that you can rent lounge chairs from if you wish. The water is gorgeous and not many rocks or Coral to avoid. Always a great breeze as well.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,If you want shade go early or bring your own. We enjoyed this beach and you can see the lighthouse from here.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,This is a nice place to snorkel. I saw a HUGE Parrot fish a flounder numerous French Angel Fish and a school of cuttlefish. I think the fish hang around because the tour boat snorkelers chum them so it is best to go when tour boats aren't there.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Mostly white sand and crystal clear water at least as far out as you can walk. Some areas did have a rough bottom and we did see a few people snorkeling in those areas.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Beautiful water walked a long way out before it got too deep. Kind of isolated from public transportation though.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Great place for snorkeling or just hanging out no vendors or facilities. A short drive up the coast from the resort hotels. Beautiful scenery!
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,like its reputation the snorkelling is great! its an easy bike ride from the high rise hotel area. Sand entry and calm waters. Not busy at all people wise
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,not crowed clean. but quite a few rocks in the water to hurt your feet. the clear blue water was worth it. no food/drinks/activities for purchase on beach
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,The beachchairs were at resonable prices only 5 dollars and actually comfy. The little van who came out sold nice hot-dogs and beverage. The beach is beatyful with little palm-roofs to protect you from the sun... although you have to be there early to get one. It also is a good place for snorkling.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Nice little beach. Rocky upon entering the water but good for snorkeling from the shore. There are some picnic tables. But no facilities.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Glad that our tour guide stopped here. We would not have known that it was such a special spot and named by the original native inhabitants.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Our favorite beach on the island. No services but it is not nearly as crowded as some of the others and the water is more fun to play in because there are waves.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Excellent beach on the western tip of the island. If you have a car it's the place to be if you don't care for the hotel crowds.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Arashi was our favorite smaller beach on Aruba with Eagle Beach being our favorite bigger beach. Arashi is very pretty has great swimming and not many people. A great beach for a quite mellow day away from the crowds.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,We had a blast at this beach! The waves were pretty big and my kids enjoyed riding in the waves all day.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Another good beach in Aruba. Get there by bus or car. No amenities but a food truck usually parks in the lot all day for small items. Get there early to get a hut - no charge no reservation.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,This was one of the pretty beaches in Aruba we thought however there are NO bathrooms! BUT pack a cooler and enjoy some time here it is beautiful!
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Don't miss it. Not crowded but open for all. Two-tone blue water white breakers (at times) plenty of palapas and lounges. Nice for reading swimming water sports or just getting a tan.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,A terrific beach for swimming and snorkeling. Beach chairs are (generally) available for rent and there are a few thatch umbrellas available (get there early!).
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Spent the day at Arashi Beach enjoying some big waves at the north end while relaxing in the calm waters of the south end. Beautiful waters and sand. Huts. GREAT snorkeling at the area just south of Arashi where some rocks are. The California Lighthouse and the restaurant look nice on the hillside.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Great place to snorkle- recommended by our resort- no facilities at all- no restaurants or restrooms free parking right on the bus route there is someone there who will setup up chairs for a fee
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,public beach but chairs available for rent under the shade. Saw some nice fish but had to swim out a bit.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,You can rent a lounge chair -- be advised that there is no restrooms. Nice to enjoy snorkeling and relaxing under the hut.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Great if you do not like crowds of people. There is no WC so it is good you know it before you go. California Light Tower is a 2 minutes drive away so you can visit is too.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Quiet little beach with big views. You can rent chairs for $5 and there is a truck with cold beverages - non alcoholic. No restroom at beach so be prepared. Go early to get a hut.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,this is what you expect from a caribian beach peace  the sand is like sugar the water crystal clear and safe for kids as the sea is not to deep for approx 500 yrds from shore not toilet facilities or food Bar  easily reached by Bus or car
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Relatively small compared to eagle beach but more snorkling opportunities. Very scenic with sailboats anchored close and the California Lighthouse in the bacground. Its away from the tourist areas so you get a chance to interact with the locals.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,A beautiful small beach quite secluded easily accessible by car or any means of transportation. Excellent for snorkeling. Very nice location no hotels only a few houses on the beach close to the north edge of the island.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,This location has the best snorkeling I've ever done. We saw thousands of fish hundreds of starfish lots of sand dollars and many many other things. This is a rocky beach with a little sandy area to enter the water. The sand has thorns in it so water shoes are a MUST!
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Lots of different fish pretty coral. It is a rocky public beach with little shade so plan with plenty of water to drink and beach/water shoes. The great snorkeling is worth it.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,I saw more here snorkling than I did diving. Snorkled for hours and did not want to get out.. PERFECT..
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,My wife and I went here twice she to sit in the water and I to snorkel. While there were some other people about it was considerably less crowded than other similar Aruban beaches probably because it's at the very northern tip of the island.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Friends introduced us to this great little beach! Water was crystal clear great for snorkeling. Lots of fish if you take some bread into the water with you they will come and eat right out of your hands.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,The nicest and most beautiful beach of the island. Tourists and locals together. Surfingsnorklingswimming... close to the north coast and californian lighthouse.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,This is quite an investing . Public and free use of facility. sea level quite not deep. great expectations for snorkeling. No sea traffic. Romantic Sun set and safe . Relax and big parking lot.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,This is a very nice beach. It was a bit more crowded on the weekend but there was still plenty of room to put a towel. The water was clear and there were a few areas where you can see beautiful fish or urchins.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Ivo from the Safari Jeep tour brought us there and we checked out the beach notice how the sand doesn't burn..that's because it's all coral fragment you'd be walking on. Nice little beach to spend a couple of hours on.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Arashi beach is one of the most beautiful beaches Aruba has. It is probably one of the best beaches in the world with the beautiful blue water white sand funny water plants and the gorgeous fish. The snorkeling is excellent all the fish swim so close to the beach and love to be watched. Arashi beach is just perfect.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,This is by the lighthouse and it's clean with very friendly staff to rent your chairs and umbrellas. Good snorkeling near by.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,While my favor beach is Eagle Beach this one is also good one.Nice and clean.Not too crowded .Recommended.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,My husband and I brought our 10 month old son to Arashi beach several times during our stay in Aruba because it was so clean picturesque and not crowded at all. There is great snorkeling nearby (complete with a shipwreck right offshore) lots of cabanas for shade and the north west side of the island boasts terrific views.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,This beach is very nice and clean. It has enough parking area and you can rent chairs  we spend the afternoon and enjoyed it very much!
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Stopped here on a tour. Gorgeous beach great water (Aruba's alwaysca little chilly compared to the Florida Gulf though). Definitely worth coming to for a day at the beach.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Love this beach don't have to snorkeling far away the fish already around us .... highly recommended
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Arashi is a smaller beach with more waves than anywhere on the developed shoreline. Most reminiscent of the Atlantic Ocean. Not a snorkeling spot at all but if you swim far over to the left around the rock formations there are fish to be found.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Rented a car and drove up to the California Light House and stopped by Arashi beach on our way back. Beautiful beach cristal clear water great for snorkeling but no showers.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,We had so much fun right off the shore snorkeling. Big fish clear water wish we would of found it sooner. Very nice at sunset too!
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Public beach nice for snorkeling. There are no bathrooms here. If you need to go #1 you go in the water #2 your out of luck. Watch your belongings. Deeper than baby beach.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,The beach is nice. Nice and secluded. Lots of shallow areas for good snorkeling and a deeper area for scuba. Always a lot of turtles up there.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Kids )5) all went snorkeling and reported back to hotel with smiling faces. Taxi's were willing to transport wet bathing suits since they had coverings for their seats so kids di not have to wait for bus. PS: It would be nice to be able to get a reliable bus schedule to the Beach.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,I think that Arashi Beach is our favorite beach in Aruba. It is right below the California Lighthouse not busy and lots of huts available to sit under to get out of the sun. The snorkeling is good its waist deep for quite a distance.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,We visited here on a Sunday afternoon and it was mostly locals at the beach (including one cute Little Mermaid Birthday Party). The sand was lovely and the snokeling shallow and beautiful. We brought a blanket to lay under one of the huts and had a wonderful afternoon.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,This was a fantastic beach to snorkel off of. The scenery is gorgeous and is very close to the California Lighthouse. I would drive here to snorkel and avoid the crowded snorkel boats as all of the good spots are accessible by car (and free)!
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,This a great beach with good parking closest to the lighthouse. Not very crowded. Not very good for snorkeling but it is fun to watch the pelicans feed and great for swimming. Long stretch of white sand.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,there weren't many people there as there isnt a hotel that backs up to it. Great little area ... we saw a starfish :)
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,White crystalline sand  shallow for yards out from shore no under current no waves and smooth sand all through out.. makes a perfect beach for relation.. and being public beach to booth !
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,This is a wonderful little stretch of beach a little further up the island from the high rise area but it is worth the time to drive or take a taxi to it for a day. There are a few little trees for shade but otherwise an awesome place for sun sand and water.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,wonderful water very good snorkeling towards north side and you are able to get away from the crowds. Enjoyed this beach several times while on the island. little rock the further north you go but you pay that price do you want sand or snorkeling. At this beach you can have both.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,i If you want to you can walk from the Marriott properties but we rented a car and drove to Arashi Beach. This is where the paid snorkel excursions take you so you can go on your own and avoid the crowded boats. Clean public beach but no beach food. The bus stops here.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,This beach is for the folks who want to get away from all the motorized water sport folks and the massive hotel resort scene of Eagle beach. They just need convenient restrooms.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,No guides needed. Show up with your snorkel gear and jump in the water. Enjoy the abundant reef and colorful fish within easy reach of the beach. Enjoyed by the locals on weekends so come early if you want to use one of the palapas to relax on the beach.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,The colorful fish are just beautiful!! The relaxing feeling you get from snorkeling cannot be beat!!! We keep our equipment in the car and just stop all the way up and down the coast.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Nice clean no washrooms some driveby food and drink. Plenty of paved parking some shady huts. Big waves the day we were there. Good snorkel if willing to go far out.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,this beach is not as large as the other one not too many people goes there nice snorkelling to be done there.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,We've been to this beach a few times its just up the road from Palm Beach. We really like it here especailly now that there are chair rentals available. Good snorkeling right off the beach
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,This was one of my favorite spots. The beach here is white powder sand with lots of huts for shade. The clear water is perfect for swimming and the snorkeling is great.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,My wife and I started several days with visits to Arashi Beach early in the morning for a quick swim and to enjoy the beach the fish!
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Busy beach very nice clean water with a great view tried snorkeling but didn't see much about .5 mile down the road the snorkeling is amazing I would walk or swim down towards the rocks and check it out you will see the tour boats anchored there.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Arashi beach is a series of small beaches along the route to the lighthouse. Buses pass there frequently or you can ask any of the boat owners to take you and arange a pick up time. Buses are cheap ($3-$4) private boat from the Marriott about $60. Great snorkeling sitting areas.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Great beach located on the north end of the island near the California lighthouse. Soft rolling waves with plenty of room to play for all. If you want to be more secluded and away from the high rise hotels this beach is a great choice.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,GF and I watched the sunset absolutely beautiul. She is a new swimmer so it was a great shallow place to teach snorkling many little rock formations in the water with fish. Not crowded either. Definitely rent a car and go here to get away from the high rise area beach.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,We rented a car for the day and drove out here. Water and sand were beautiful and clean!! There were not hundreds of people at this beach. There were waves! Which was nice.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,This is a beautiful beach popular with both locals and tourists. Definitely worth a visit. There's a cute little ice cream stand there where you can buy water Popsicles or fresh coconut water.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,It was quiet relaxing great location. The water is pretty clear. Palapas was a plus lounge chairs available for rent also a plus. Don't forget to taste the pistachio ice cream!
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,This is a small beach area and if you are into snorkeling this is the place to go; but if you don't want too many children around this is not the pace to go.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,This was a nice beach with a few waves for the kids. The breakers blocked some of the waves but we still got some good snorkeling. Saw a huge live starfish and zillions of fish. The shade huts were great but there were no facilities that we saw.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,We read this beach is great for snorkeling but we preferred Malmok. This beach has no facilities (neither does malmok though) and there are a ton of people there cause the 'tours' have this beach on their routes (jeep and 4-wheeler tours). So it was pretty busy.... but it is a beautiful (small) beach.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Secluded and peaceful. Not overly crowded. Very picturesque. Water very clear. Great for snorkelling. California lighthouse close by.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,we loved everything about it. You can't go wrong with any beach in Aruba their all beautiful. Go the the lighthouse and go to downtown shopping but to on the side streets. They will bargin more with you.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Great beach area to visit. Not far from the hotel high rise area with white sandy beaches. Not good for snorkeling due to the undercurrent. The sand gets the water very cloudy.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Go to the far left area of the beach with good snorkeling near the rocks. Some tourist boats come to this area but numbers were not overwhelming. This is the farthest beach north close to the California lighthouse.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,This beach is located near the California lighthouse. It was not crowded when we got there at 11 am and we managed to get the last available palapa. The water is beautiful in all of Aruba but it's not as windy as Arashi beach. Pack drinks and snacks as there are no restaurants nearby.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,What a great snorkel spot I usually wear water shoes because it is very rocky at the shore line. Once past the rocks it is great beautiful coral reefs and a great variety of fish. It's.a nice place to spend time pack a cooler and a good book. Enjoy!
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Super clean with hardly anyone there. Very private and a great alternative to the super busy Palm beach. Once we went to Arashi beach we didn't go back to Palm.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,not crowded and many fish to see. A nice sandy area to walk out into the water. Crystal blue water within walking distance of the high rise area.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,If you make the mistake and go to the lighthouse then stop here afterwards to cool off. The lighthouse was a waste of time but this beach made up for it. Plus there's this awesome shaved ice foodtruck in the parking lot who puts - this is new to me - condensed milk on his shaved ice drinks. AMAZING!!!
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Nice beach for swimming and snorkeling our just taking in some rays lots of beach huts. we go there at least once on every trip we bring our own snorkel gearand we pack some food and drinks very nice place to relax for a day and I have always seen a lot of fish when snorkeling there
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Yes the sand is white and soft. But there are no changing facilities. It is rocky getting into the water so shoes are a must. And the day we were there you couldn't see a thing there was so much sand stirred up. While we didn't stop at any other beaches it looked like there were bigger better choices.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,The beach is nice for sunbathing but the snorkeling is not as good as Malmok beach. You can rent chairs for $5 and the waves are bigger here than some of the other beaches. It is nice and quiet away from the big hotels and close to the California lighthouse
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,This beach was not really as nice as the other beaches on the island but there were plenty of rocks and coral to see at the beach which of course attracts tropical fish. Go to snorkel but there are not a lot of restaurants nearby like Palm Beach.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Just an absolutely beautiful beach on a beautiful island. Get there early before 9:00 if you want a hut for some shade. Awesome clear blue water
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Spent the day at Arashi and it was sublime. Lounge chair rentals are 5$ and you get private huts to put them under. Enjoy a good book in the shade or swimming in the wavy water. Very nice quiet beach there were even people surfing!
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,This beach is located down by the lighthouse. It has beautiful white powdery sand and crystal clear waters and a few palapas.. You can find good snorkeling right off this beach. This is in a very high end location of Aruba. Enjoy !
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Lots of interesting marine life. I have never seen so many colorful fish in one place in the wild. Nice relaxing place about 5 min by car from my hotel.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Perfect for getting away from the crowds. No services beyond chair rental but great swimming palapas lush cactus and a lovely view of the California Lighthouse. After trying for over 40 years my sweetie finally learned to swim here so there is definitely something magical in the air.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,The best beech in Aruba. You need to bring your own chairs unless you want to rent them for 10 dollars. Very beautiful.There are huts to sit under but you will be in the water your whole visit.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,be creative if you want to experience small and private beaches it can get crowded fast if everybody goes for the same spot but go early makes it work. We even met famous Dutch Tv hostes with her family.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,There comes a wave once and a wile it nice relaxing sunset is very beautifull from any beach actually!
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,We visited most beaches from North to South and East to West. This is the best by far! Nice easy waves some soft sand with shells and some rocks to snorkel occasional rolling surf beautiful coconut palms and parking. Easy access.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Nice laid back beach. Good snorkeling to the left (southeast). We had a cab drop us off and arranged for a pickup time. You need to bring a change of clothes because cabs will not pick up wet passengers. No bathroom. Chair rental ($5/each) and a snack/soda/snowball truck.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,because it is near the north end it can get a a little breezier and the waves can kick up some. but some of the nicest sand and there is a new parking lot and several palapas. a very pretty spot to spen the afternoon.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,We loved going to Arashi beach! Beautiful sand and clear water! The best snorkeling in my opinion in aruba! Best find in aruba! a must!
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Also a public beach -peacefully tucked away in a pristine neighbourhood. Sandier bottom than Palm beach near the hotel strip the sand here gradually descends into the ocean. The clear blue waters inviting!
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Quiet small waves at times for body surfing. Mostly locals but more tourists as it is discovered. Easy bus ride from the High Rises.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,This is a very nice and relatively secluded beach. Over the years it has become a bit rough and the under tows are not really conducive to having other than fairly strong swimmers use the beach. Waves can literally knock you over. Beach area is small but nice. Go and try it out.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,$5 chair rentals. Easy enough to find space. Nice ice cream truck doing drive-by's. Family friendly. Seemed to be a mix of locals and tourists.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,We combined our visit to the California Lighthouse with a couple of hours of relaxation at Arashi Beach. It was convenient to parking and relatively uncrowded compared to the area by our high rise hotel. Just bring a few towels to sit on a cooler with some beverages and enjoy the view!
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,This is probably the nicest beach near the hotel area for snorkeling. You have to bring your own chairs etcbecause there are no facilities. There are a few palapas.There are rocks where the snorkeling is good. The other beaches in the hotel area are too clear with very few fish.

g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,I loved snorkling there. Clear and beautiful water! Worth a visit! but as a beack place I'm sure the hotel beach is a better option!
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Pretty beach great view and loaded with submerged boulders. Couple that with a strong surf and well you know what could happen if your not careful.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Nice quit beach with good snorkeling. Having been to Hawaii where the fish are more plentiful this falls into a good second.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,This beach had beautiful pink seashells. Nice to walk up and down . The bus stops right at this beac. Very convenient.

g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Another beautiful beach in Aruba near the high rise area . Good snorkeling with sandy beach access to get to snorkeling . Mostly locals ... Most friendly !!! No public restrooms !! Huts are for sharing !!!
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,I went to Arashi Beach for a surf lesson as the waves are more abundant in this area. The water was great. There were quite a few rocky/coral areas but not too bad. I didn't like the sand too much as there were a lot of broken seashells and I got cut on my toe.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Great time snorkeling. Best area is in front of the home next to the beach. Lost of beautiful fish and corals.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,This was the first beach my family and I went to. And we were surprised by the amount of fishes that were by the shore. We literally had to splash them away. Its perfect to snorkle and see all the great little fishes we got to see.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,okay this beach is more quiet than Palm. You can walk quite a ways but you may need shoes for heavy exploring. This beach does not have chairs just beautiful sand and a few places for shade..it gets busier on the weekend nut it never feel as crowded as Palm Beach.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Nice beach here you get a true taste of deeper waters some more powerful than along the Palm and Eagle beach areas. Once mainly for the locals many tourists spend a few hours enjoying this area.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,The beach is very clean and there are a number of palapas available but you need to arrive early as the beach fills up with tour buses. The wave action is quite thrilling but the snorkeling was dissapointing. Well worth a side trip as it is less crowded than Palm/Eagle Beach.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Snorkeled here today with my six year old. We liked it. Easy entry and plenty of fish to see. There were also palapas to sit under. Note that there is some construction going on on Boca Catalina but it did not bother us.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Just all redone by the government and is easy parking and nice and clean. Not many people during the week but many locals on the weekends. Still a nice beach to spend the day.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,The gem of a beach is located past the high rise action of town. It has been voted one of the top beaches in the world. As all beaches in Aruba are public you can bring beach towels and chairs and waste away your day. Remember to take and dispose of your trash in receptacles including your cigarette butts.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Absolutely beautiful beach. Quiet not crowded and you feel like you are in paradise. Short drive or cab ride from the high rise hotel area.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,took the snorkel trip and went to the Antilla Arashi and Boca Catalina good service and pleasant ride.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Water is Beautiul! Great local beach and had a great time. There was alot of good waves here. I would recommend visiting the local beaches i you are staying at a resort.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Of all the beaches I found this to be the best although all the beaches there were really nice if of in the are you should check it out.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,several shade huts for sun protection parking area but no facilities. Snorkeling is so-so however we took a snorkeling catamaran trip and one of the stops was furtheroff this beach which allowed us to see more and bigger fish.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,This was an absolutely beautifil beach. We snorkled here one morning and thoroughly enjoyed the sand and clear water.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Less busy as the hotels are a mile south this area offers some good snorkeling off the beach. We saw a large variety of fish.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Arashi is a beautiful secluded beach that is not visited by too many people. Unfortunately the tide is traditionally quite strong as are the waves thta coe into it. They are strong enough to knock people over - so if you are not a strong swimmer then reconsider going to the place other than to see it.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,We ended up coming here more than palm Beach during out one week stay. Water was much clearer and great for snorkeling
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,We would not stop back by this beach. As the title states we did no experience anything great here. Go and stay on Eagle instead.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Great spot for snorkeling white clean beach. Get there early if you want a palapas or to rent chairs. Not much shade but has one of the best spots for snorkeling outside of going on a boat trip.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Excellent beach even for kids you can snorkel or only with glasses you can see under the water around you little fishes sea stars and more sea life! I just wished there was a shower over there! But not everything is perfect!
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,This is my favorite Aruba beach for swimming. As other reviewers have mentioned there are not a lot of facilities here but great for swimming--the waves are very gentle. The snorkeling spots are nearby where all of the snorkel boats stop. You can take the bus here. Short walk from the bus line.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,We loved this beach! It was not as crowded as the high rise area hotels in Palm/Eagle beach and the waters weren't as deep. You can catch a cab or a bus ride towards the light tower and there you'll find the beautiful Arashi! It's worth the trip! Don't tell too many folks or we'll ruin it!
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,This beach is beautiful. Beautiful water not crowded quiet $5.00 a lounge chair nice safe parking lot....what more could you ask for! This was our favorite. We were in Aruba for 2 weeks so we were at a lot of beaches. Bring a cooler and sit back and relax.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,This is a beach that locals go to. It doesn't have an facilities - a few palapas but that's it. Beatiful area to get sunset pictures
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Powder soft white sand. Color of water. Not too crowded. Finding shells (a few). Easy parking. Windsurfing offerings.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,A beautiful haven of tranquility well worth a visit. Take refreshments with you other than that enjoy
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Nice sandy white beach but also is great for beach combing. The fellow selling the chairs for $5.00 is awesome and there was a small drinks stand. The water is fabulous sometimes windy and wavy.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Beautiful beach away from the hustle and bustle of Eagle and Palm Beaches. Also in a lovely neighborhood near California Lighthouse.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Very private little areas you can go and sit lots of things to see in the water. No bathroom facilities. Beautiful views.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Nice piece of sand but not raked clean and limited shade. It attracts a bigger crowd than I expected considering its location away from the hi-rise. The snorkeling is good and you should bring a cooler with drinks. A dude rents chairs if you want them but there are no other amenities except free parking.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Rode the bus here from High Rise hotel area. Water was crystal clear and absolutely beautiful. You can rent chairs for the day. My only complaint is that there are no bathrooms or restaurants to eat nearby this beach.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,We stayed across from eagle beach but the drive to Arashi beach was so worth it . We enjoyed this beach the most. The water was crystal clear and the beach was not populated. The snorkelling was good warm water and sun shine made this day perfect.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,We took our snorkel gear and caught a bus to this beach. It is very close to the California Lighthouse. We loved it. This was a great spot for snorkeling and just absolutely gorgeous with divi divi trees and beautiful rock. Take some dog biscuits to feed the fish. They love it! And they disinegrate slowly.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Half of the beach has a reef that is great for snorkeling. The other half is calm clear and shallow for a long distance. It's great for swimming or just floating. In one small section(maybe 10 feet) the tiny waves were crashing enough for some kids to try surfing. This beach was 2nd favorite after Eagle Beach.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,We snorkeled and did a scuba dive from this beach it is really nise with deep white sand which provided easy access with our dive equipment on. There is nice coral formations full of colorful reef fish without undertow or lrage waves. There is plenty of parking and is easy to get to by cab or rental car
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,nice beach for snorkeling. small not so touristy great for families and people who are not the best swimmers. my best beach day was there and i had one of the more popular beaches across from my hotel.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,small great snorkeling a few palapas. great for avoiding a crowd (and maybe getting a palapa?) but still small and narrow. Nicely marked in a beautiful part of the island easy parking.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,This is the best beach if you have never snorkled and are trying it out the water is super clear and calm.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Madi our tour guide took us to this beach and we played in the 12+ ft waves all day and had a blast!
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Rocky beach not ideal for playing. Great for snorkeling along with Malmok and Catalina Boca in between.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Local beach with lovely local people. Arubians know how to enjoy their island and it is on display at Arashi Beach.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,We took the bus from our hotel and we stayed at Arashi for 4 hours and we loved everything from snorkeling to just sitting back and watching the magnificent view of the turquoise ocean . There are no bathrooms but their is a snack truck on the day we went last Saturday.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,This is a public beach. and so is Malmok which we prefer.All the boat trips bring their clients there to snorkle. So don't pay for the boat trip for snorkeling. Bring yoiur own from home. The cost will save you $$ and one use will cover the cost for rental.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Gorgeous beach! This was our 4th visit to Aruba and we always make time for Arashi beach. This beach is very close to the California Lighthouse.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,I love Arashi beach! We rented a car and drove out there one day. The water is shallow and crystal clear. We had a great time even on a cloudy day. :)
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,This is a great public beach out of the way has waves clear water and is near where all the snorkeling boat trips come to see the fish. You can take the bus or drive here and it is worth it!! Better than Baby Beach.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Beautiful beach that was deserted when we where there. Great snorkeling to the left of the beach ( behind the lovely homes on the beach). Nice coral formations colorful fish and lovely beach with a long sandbar that takes you out about 150 yards . Baby Beach was best but Arashi will not dissapoint.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,We didn't spend any time on the beach; we just drove past it and remarked that it was a nice place to visit!
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,The beach is small so arrive early in the day to get your palabra and lounge chairs. Trust me it's worth it if you're looking to snorkel. The biodiversity is extremely impressive! I even saw a sea turtle!
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,beautiful beach can rent lounge chairs for $5.00 ea. set under a palapas and your ready.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Make sure you visit this beach! It's the one you see on most brochures for Aruba and a true photo must see!
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Quiet away from the hotels...chaises for rent...just glorious ..felt almost private..my favorite beach in Aruba
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,This is a great beach up near the lighthouse -- beautiful water. A little rocky but you can do some snorkeling and see more than in palm beach. Only downside is there were now showers to wash the sand off your feet before getting back in the car!
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,It was crowded but still a good time. Swam out in the ocean to snorkle a bit and it was nice. Watch out for the boats.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Calm crystal blue water! It reminds of a very similar beach on another island I visit regularly. This is the real deal.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,This beach was less crowded and nice like palm beach. I did not see any fish while here though as far as snorkeling goes.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,If you wanna relax and or snorkeling in the most beautiful beach in Aruba .. that`s the place
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,We found Arashi by driving up to the lighthouse. Its a short drive from the high rise hotels and definitely worth the visit. It was pristine great snorkeling and barely a soul there. If you want peace and quiet this is a great location to visit the beach.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Clear waters probably the clearest we went to could see the angel fish and other small fish. No problems no bites. Warm water great !!!!
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,saw some interesting fish nothing special but it was fun to be in the water exploring.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,This beach was near our hotel and great for snorkeling. Many locals came here with their families. It was clean white sand to walk on. Found some good shells here.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,It was terrible! We expected to see a beautiful beach but were surprise with the quality of this beach. We went there as part of a tour it was Dirty rocky and we do not recommend it. We were spoiled by Manchebo/Eagle beach.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Chill - locals - small - clean - great place for a picnic
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,The color of the water the breeze the temp of the water... Go there if you have the chance it's such beautiful and pristine beach and it's the only one where there are no vendors or people trying to sell you stuff.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Easy access by car was good. The views-like most of the Aruba beaches--are great. We had fun snorkeling but not where we would want to hang out for hours. Lots of the tour boats stop to snorkel here so you know it is a good spot for that.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Secluded no facilities but great area to snorkel on your own. Where the snorkel boats go. Private so take your own food and water.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Beautiful beach with very clear water! I would not recommend it for snorkeling(we saw maybe three fish) but great for a day of complete relaxation in the sun.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,We stopped here on our way back from the California and it was a great stop! Not too crowded nice clean beach with some huts available to stay out of the sun!
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,This beach was a few minutes from where we were staying and I'm really glad it was. Clean not too crowded beautiful water nice swimming. There's a guy who rents beach chairs for $5. Get there early for a palm hut for shade and a place to put your stuff.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Less crowded than the high rise area of Palm Beach and you can rent lounge chairs from a guy if you need them. Much more scenic in my opinion than Palm Beach and it's only a quick bus ride away from the high rise area. Highly recommend if you're looking for something away from the hotels!
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Great Snorkel beach we love it so gorgeous! We visit quite often.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,We drove out to the Lighthouse Restaurant to have an afternoon drink and past by this newly finished area. The next day we packed a little lunch and went back and spent a few hours. The beach is perfect for children as the water is fairly shallow warm and calm.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Its a great place to snorkel  there is plenty of fishes. However if you make your way out you will be stepping on many stones and rock so don't walk out instead flow
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,We spent almost every day here because it was clean and never too crowded.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,The unfortunate thing about Arashi is that the snorkeling is so good it gets crowded on a weekend. Easy to access it truly is a very amazing place on the island.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,A nice beach to go to with the family a little crowded though.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,My favorite beach of all. Clear waters sandy waves and quiet all you could ask for.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,This is one of the most beautiful beaches in Aruba. It is also a great snorkeling spot. Bring water there is no restaurants and bar near to this beach. There is a parking lot.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,This beach is very pretty. No public bathrooms or restaurants and can be a bit tricky to get to and from if you don't have a cars. Worth the trip especially if you like to snorkel!
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Thoroughly enjoyed this beach. Quiet with mostly locals. You can rent chairs and we had no problems grabbing a palapa. Slight waves which were nice. Great place to relax and unwind. They are opening a facility building with restrooms and a cafe.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,A nice sandy beach. Not much snorkeling. There are a number of palapas for shade and beach chairs are available.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Another Aruba amazing beach! Great for snorkeling and water activities! It's on the upper North corner of the island close to the lighthouse. Quiet amazing beach...simply beautiful.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,This beach area is less crowded from the Palm Beach area. Went snorkeling by the Boca Catalina area. The snorkeling was great as well as observing the pelicans.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Saw many fish today. Two main varieties (don't know my fish but one type was silver and the other yellow and black) and a lot of them. Just need to be careful of the rock and coral bottom.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,This beach is north of the other large beach. Beware the sand crab are all at that beach lately and they have put a law not to swim at night you could be put in jail. That was in the news there last week in Aruba.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,great beach. Not as windy as Palm beach and less crowded
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,A wonderful public beach has portolets as well. Chairs to rent for $5. Warm turquoise water and views of the lighthouse. Great place to spend some time away from the hotels.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Crystal Clear water tons of fish easy swim to reef. No facilities but the local newspaper said that Arashi Beach was scheduled for a refurbish
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,It has the most beautiful blue water in the whole Aruba. Nice snorkeling further out nice long walks convenient parking palapas... It is very close to the Aruba Light House you can see it from Arashi parking lot. It can be busy later afternood the best time to come are morning hours.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,You could walk out quite far and still be in knee deep water! The waves were fun while not being too rough to enjoy! Just gorgeous and relaxing to watch them roll in with the spray they created. Simply lovely.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Quick walk from the main strip. It's great just like all of Aruba's beaches!
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Beautifull color of the sea and beach sand. Not to many peaople near to nice snorkling area and view on the California lighthouse. No shops. Bring your own food and beverages
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Enjoyed the peaceful surroundings although the beach was a little more rough than PalmEagle and Baby Beach. Enjoyed the snorkelling but did not go on a day with the best weather as it was overcast. Will return on a clear day.

g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Not used too often a bit out of the way Not too many persons go there used more for snorkiling
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Great place for viewing birds. Not so crowded. You can take the bus to it close to the ligh house and Malmok beach
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,beautiful water sand not crowded. Quieter than near the hotels.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,beautiful beach outside of the resorts that offers a family setting.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,It is a very beautiful beach to spend a romantic day with your partner away from the hustle and bustle of all the hotels. Enjoy it

g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Arashi is the largest sandy beach on the northern part of the island. There are several palapas and chair rental. There is a pretty good drop off from the beach down to the water.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,The best part about Aruba is that all the beaches are open to everyone. Get a car and drive to each little beach you find. They each have their own charm and are all worth seeing
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Arashi beach is one of the most beautiful on the island. The sand is pristene and it's a great way to relax away from the hotel hustle bustle!
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Arashi Beach is awesome. All you need is a Coronna and a beach chair. it doesnt get any better than that.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Arashi beach is on the way to the California Lighthouse. Great views!! Water was very clear. A must go place while in Aruba. Do not miss it!!
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Didn't think we'd see many fish but we did. Snorkeling right off the beach. A couple guys with coolers there if you want drinks. Take a car because getting back there is no bus route there.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Beautiful beach with crystal clear water but there are no facilities whatsoever there is just a guy with a van selling drinks and some snacks and a guy renting umbrellas but no toilets no bars or restaurants and also transport is limited
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,My older children (14 19 & 22-yrs. old) loved this beach's mild waves! The sand was white and soft and going into the water was a gentle slope. The water temperature in December was good too.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,I saw this beach on the way to see the California Lighthouse and just HAD to stop and take pictures because it was so gorgeous! The water was some of the clearest I've ever seen and I've been to many beach in the Carribean. A must see while you are in Aruba.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,We loved this beach! Uncrowded uncommercialized all natural vegetation and a few villas on the beach. A nice parking lot with a portapotty and a tailgate vendor of frresh fruit and batidas. Snorkel sun walk and afterwards stop at the lighthouse (3 Minutes) for happy hour to watch the sunset in a completely dramatic natural setting.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,You have to go. Is a very nice beach. Rent a car if you plan to go to aruba. And please do not stay in an all inclusive you are going to miss a lot of things in the island
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Me and my wife had a romantic picnic! The best place to see the sunset is here and the best place to take sunset pictures.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,you find more locals here on this beach and it's very nice.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Arashi beach is so amazing!!!... ideal for snorkeling. I recommend spending a day on this beach to relax and enjoy a piece of paradise.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,more of the "locals beach" great walks up the coast and beautiful waves
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Very nice quiet beach relative to Palm beach/ Eagle beach. A bit more waves than the other beaches but very minimal still. $5 for lawn chairs.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,The beach has good parking and shade - bring a picnic. The water was mellow with nice smooth swells. Fun to bathe in.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,The beach was great for long walks. It was also very clean and not crowded.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Great snorkeling Soft Sand! Stunning location! Great place to bring a meal set up at a tiki hut!
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,loved it probably our fav beach of our trip -- plenty of parking so just bring a cooler some cold drinks and enjoy the water and view
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Beautiful white sand and fabulous shells & coral. Careful of the undertow. Very quite and peaceful.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Really liked the space here it was very comfortable and easy to grab some shade or sun. beautiful water as with the entire island but the tourists at the main beaches are pretty annoying!
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Best part was the Italian restaurant at lighthouse at sunset. Only had a drink but the view was great
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,When you park the car head down the beach to your left (the direction of high rise hotels). Most people don't go down the beach as far so it will be more secluded for you. There are some nice rocky outcrops to snorkel around.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Less crowded and there is usually an open hut no matter what time arrive unless you have the misfortune of arriving at the same time the DePalm tour pulls in. Plenty of parking. Great snorkeling. There are chairs to rent ($5 each) but no bathroom facility!
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Must go to see and take pics with the Divi trees and beach.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Gorgeous Beach with easy swimming; waves not too strong and Excellent Snorkeling!!!
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,We loved this beach. Plenty of parking. Chairs to rent. Bring some bread crumbs as the fish come right up for snacks!
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Amazing beach about 5 mins drive from Bananas apartments and the Lighthouse. The day I spent there I enjoyed waves white sand and very few people. Incredible. There are tikis available.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,We rented a car and visited Arashi Beach several timesearly in the morning we were the only ones the sea is very nice here more waves than at palm beach. No restaurants/bars etc. just a beatifull beach ! Bring some bread and the fish eat from your hand. Also a lace where turtles lay their eggs.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Arashi beach is a must! We spent most of our stay at this particular beach. Snorkeling not as good as they say but beach will make up for it.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Convenient to High rise hotel area. Plenty of parking no facilities. Beautiful beach calm water enjoyed the snorkeling plenty of fish.There are some huts to stash your gear.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Grab a rental car and go to more of the secluded beaches on the island. Although this beach is quite small it is beautiful! However it crowds up quickly.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Arashi beach was more secluded and quiet than palm beach. There ere less people and it was more relaxing. It was along the bus line and a nice hike from the high rise hotel area just remember to take water!
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,

g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Amazing sand not crowded good snorkeling caught a few bonefish on flyrods and crabs lizards and iguanas by hand.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Loved Arashi Beach. Quiet no crowds saw lots of great fish. our favorites were huge french angel fish.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Arashi was definitely the best beach we visited while in Aruba with Manchebo a close second. Nestled along the very northern tip of the island It's far more enjoyable and relaxing than the honky-tonk of Palm Beach.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Good snorkeling by the large divi tree saw some great fish and my husband says boobies. Beware there is some topless tanners there. A few tikis with shade somewhat clean beach.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Wide stretch of beautiful white sand ideal for sunning. Snorkeling here is great at either side of the beach. Very easy entry into the water. Safe swimming. Quiet during the week. Popular with locals at the weekend so can be busy then but that just adds to the atmosphere.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,The sand is so white and the water is so crystal clear. Some locals go to this beach so you know it's a good one. The water is so shallow you can walk out so far. I enjoyed it much more than baby beach!!! The reef here is very nice and attracts a lot of fish.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Arashi Beach was a great escape from the resort beaches and all of the people. There were only about 16 people on the entire beach when we were there! Snorkeling was great!
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Arashi beach was my favorite in Aruba. The water is really clear not murky like Palm beach. You can snorkle right off to the side. The fish actually swim right over to you. It is really beautiful there. I wish I had discovered it right as I got to Aruba. I would have gone there more times.
g147249,d148915,February 8 2016,Arashi offers the best combination of swimming and snorkeling on the island better than Baby Beach on the southern tip of the island. The crystal clear aquamarine water stays around 82 degrees and it doesn't get much better than that. Arashi Malmok and Baby Beaches are the 3 best for snorkeling.

g147249,d148915,March 13 2016,Arachi is the best snorkeling spot. The best thing is you can get there just by riding the local bus. No need to go for the expensive boat ride.
g147249,d148915,March 13 2016,We went to search for a lighthouse and found a beautiful beach as well. It is clean and low key & worth a few moments to take it all in!
g147249,d148915,March 13 2016,This beach lies the furthest north on the coast but is worth the ride. It sits below the California lighthouse area and has real nice parking and restroom facilities. There are some palapas for sitting under and the beach has soft sand and the water is generally calm close to shore.
g147249,d148915,March 13 2016,We make it a point to come here each time we visit Aruba. Breaking waves and great snorkeling just off the beach.
g147249,d148915,March 13 2016,Beautiful beach white sand turquoise water. Good snorkeling. If you walk along the beach you can find some places that are a little more sheltered from the wind. The water is warmer than at Eagle Beach.
g147249,d148915,March 13 2016,Want to get away from all the crowds on Palm Beach? Head out to this place you will not regret it!!
g147249,d148915,March 13 2016,
g147249,d148915,March 13 2016,
g147249,d148915,March 13 2016,Gave this beach a try and it was a pleasant experience. It is a little more windy but that provides the waves. This is not a crowed beach like the hotels. The only cost is for a rental chair if you want it and that is $7/day.

g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,A beautiful beach with small coral formations for beginning snorkelers. Few amenities - when we were there there was no snack stand and no bathrooms. There were beach chairs for rent ($7/each) and limited umbrellas both permanent and for rent. Still a worthwhile place to mix it up with your Aruban beaches!

g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,This is the beach from the Marriot hotels. There are a lot of activities to do. Diving jet sky water sports. One of my favorite beaches.
g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,The beach is beautiful: white sand and blue water. Unfortunately the island is flat with little shade. We went on a beach bike ride and had to stop because the wind was so hot and humid.

g147249,d148915,February 14 2016,during a day we chose to drive around and check out the island we decide to checkout Arashi. Very different feel then Eagle/Palm beach. Glad I had the snorkeling stuff in the car...a few interesting things to see with very little effort.

g147249,d150447,March 10 2016,I stay on Palm Beach but we drive over to Eagle Beach because it is less crowded and the sand is softer!
g147249,d150447,March 10 2016,Fabulous beach you MUST spend a day at Eagle Beach one of the top 10 beaches in the world. Bring $30 for a lounge chair.
g147249,d150447,March 10 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 9 2016,Love Eagle Beach water is just beautiful quite. Aruba is in my heart. Can't wait to go back. Such a nice beach.
g147249,d150447,March 9 2016,This is truly a beautiful beach. Gorgeous clear turquoise water white sand magnificent breeze. But get up early to reserve a hut. Most mornings all were taken by 6AM!
g147249,d150447,March 9 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 9 2016,so clean and calm and safe..we walked all over day and night. food is great and the deli at the big grocery store is excellent.
g147249,d150447,March 8 2016,Beautiful beach the day I was there the waves were very strong. Did not experience this on other beaches.
g147249,d150447,March 8 2016,This beach is just amazing if you like a calm ocean. It is extremely long and beautiful. Not for me because of no ocean action to calm but absolutely stunning. Kind Regards Friscoboy
g147249,d150447,March 8 2016,Wonderful sandy CLEAN beach. Lots of places to relax and view the water. Need to exercise caution from the sun by using a good quality sun screen.
g147249,d150447,February 15 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 15 2016,My son and I came here to take pictures at sunset. We found it so beautiful that we brought the whole family back every day to play. Pink and white sand aquamarine water safe and clean.
g147249,d150447,February 15 2016,Beautiful Beach- Lots of room to enjoy your space without people right on top of you. Powder sand and clean.
g147249,d150447,February 15 2016,Eagle Beach the best day of your dreams white sand crystal blue water beautiful weather everyday. Discover one of the most inviting places in the world
g147249,d150447,February 14 2016,An exceptional beach....So beautiful to walk up and down the beach side. The water is a little more rough but you are able to go in and swim
g147249,d150447,February 13 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 12 2016,Went a couple of times to Eagle beach. Decided not to try Palm Beach after many reviews mentioning how crowded and noisy it was. Eagle beach is beautiful water is clear and calm (good for kids) but with some little waves. Baby beach is unbeatable but Eagle was closer.
g147249,d150447,February 12 2016,We took a cab from the port to get some rays. It's a long and quite deep beach so even at peak times there is still plenty of space. We hired a couple of sun loungers and a shade for the day. The sand is nice the water is pleasant and the weather was lovely - what's not to like.
g147249,d150447,February 12 2016,There is also a hot dog stand and places to purchase drinks. Umbrellas and chairs available for purchase. My favorite beach of all!
g147249,d150447,February 12 2016,a quiet beach for relaxation...water sports..and sunbathing....large beaches..not many people...you may find more wind in this beach than in others..
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,Eagle Beach is located on High Rise Hotel row and is quite long. There are numerous places to rent an umbrella and chairs along with jet skis. The beach is so beautiful and water is fairly warm. One of my favorite beaches in Aruba.
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,One of the world's best beaches. We've been lucky to travel to many beaches in the US including Hawaii. We also experienced the beautiful beaches of many of the Caribbean islands and Aruba is on our top 10 list.
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,beautiful beach and nice place to visit. a lots of people. and cars! almost all the beach on the island are as nice!
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,The beach is exactly what you would expect assuming you have read the previous reviews. My only tip is take the local bus...easy to find and frequent. Cost about 2 american dollars. Taxi 16!
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,Eagle Beach is the most beautiful on all of Aruba. Perfect sand perfect sun perfect views. If your resort is on Eagle Beach no need to go visit any other beach... You'll only be let down.
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,So glad we stayed across from this beach! It was better than the ones for the super expensive resorts!
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,I loved the water!!! It was awesome. You know the sand was nice too! I liked swimming and playing volley ball in the sand. Boy It was probably the nicest beach i have ever been too!
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,Breezes and white sand lunch or dinner on the beach. Everything is so great I think it is the most beautiful and best beach in Aruba.
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,Lots of beach space restaurants nearby. Long stretch of beach with some tree coverage and clear waters. Slightly less crowded than palm beach.
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,Lots of room to enjoy the view and the water. Unless you are at one of the hotels plan to pay for beach chairs and shade is at a premium so be there early if you want to be out of the sun.
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,Beautiful White sandy beach with clear blue/turquoise waters! It can get a little crowded so go early!
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,Right next to LaCabana waves are fun  beautiful romantic sunsets. Staff helps with chairs and selecting a hut for shade. Great cocktails right on the beach
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,The beach this past year was the deepest we have ever experienced. It was 100 hundred yards from the first Chickie to the water and absolutely pristine white coral sand.
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,this is a very nice quiet beach not many people in the water surprised me. I was in and out of water all day. the water is a little rough at times but very nice
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,I liked everything tremendously. It's the whitest sand I know and the sea is the most beautiful one in the world!!
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,One of the nicest beaches on the Island always top rated in mags. I love the spot across from Oceania condos. Palapas for shade are first come first served. Great beach for long walks in the morning and at sunset!
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,Nice beachclean smooth waves the resorts are very crowded a lot of noise if you prefare more relaxed beaches go to the Manchebo Beach. Quite older much smaler resorts like Buccati & Tara and Manchebo or the Aruba Beach Club. Have fun on the beach.....
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,Softest sand I've ever touched well maintained with no local pestering. The tiki umbrellas are a great addition. The beach has commercial components (bar restaurants rentals) but they are very well meshed with the natural beauty.
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,very windy in March & April. Apparently always is. Didn't know that before we booked. Stayed at Bluegreen Resort which is across the street but that wasn't a problem.
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,Both Eagle and Palm Beach are nice but it is easier to find a more peaceful spot on Eagle beach. In many places it felt like walking in flour. The sand is that fine.
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,It was Gorgeous the water was crystal clear it was very warm had lots of fun water sport activites that you could do and great coffee shops around it.
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,This beach is the prettiest beach in Aruba. It does not have all of the Big High Rises on it only the small elite Time Share Units. And that is the way we like it. Close enough to make it convenient but far enough away from the large crowds.
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,This beach is clean and absolutely wonderful the view the swimming. The assistance is so gracious to help.
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,Eagle beach is a great beach. The ocean is clean and gorgeous. The beach is well maintained and not too crowded. Love the walkway along the beach for walking.
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,Lovely white sands and LaCabana keeps it pristine around their cabanas. For walking and for swimming it's one of the best on the island or any other Caribbean location I've been to. Walking north one can explore the lava jetties or south just walk the coastline and dip into the ocean!
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,It is less crowded than palm beach very quiet and warm water. We really loved it is the perfect place to enjoy the sun
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,I'm not a beach person but this place is awesome! Looks like a movie design for paradise. It was a little crowded but I guess it would be a little optimistic of me to think I was the only one who would appreciate it. Even with the crowds it was very clean.
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,Great beach for long walks. Clean and picturesque. Nice swimming in the ocean too. Sail boats and water activities too
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,Sand felt like slippery clay not your typical grainy sand. Beach sand could use a raking to get up all the bottle caps and crap
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,A clean warm white-sand beach. Very few shells but I did find some interesting coral. The ocean is beautiful. There are ships and pelicans to look at.
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,I had a wonderful experience in Aruba but eagle beach surprised me! Amazing water and sand... A lot of bars on the sand. The view of the beach is lovely!
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,A beautiful Caribbean beach - the sand the colors the breeze - hotels hence people everywhere but still very relaxing. Stayed at the Radisson - Palapas and chairs were very comfortable and services everywhere. NOT secluded by any stretch.
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,Eagle Beach is an expansive idyllic tropical beach on Aruba. Warm calm water coupled with white sand and gentle trade winds make a day on Eagle Beach a sensory delight. Add a cocktail a significant other and call me when its time to go home.
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,Good place to stop. When we were there it was quiet. We were told that during a certain time of the year sea turtles lay their eggs and if you lucky enough see them scamper into the water.
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,The beach is soft white sand never gets hot clear sky and beautiful water with a nice wind which is much needed as it is 85-90 daily
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,Quieter and nicer than Palm beach just has public access and a road fronting it so it dosent have the hotel row thing going on.
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,

g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,It is a gorgeous beach. Some resorts have a problem with too many palapas and chairs. Find out before you book.
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,We loved this beach. Sand is like cotton on your feet. Free huts and lots of trees for shade. Great place to swim in calm waters.
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,One of the best beaches I have visited. It is well-kept and clean. It is a lot wider and not as crowded as Palm Beach.
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,Not crowded at all while we were there beautiful view of the sunset! White sandy beach and clear blue water. Steer away from the crowded beaches in the high rise hotel zone.
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,quiet and mellow. supermarket nearby. Great restaurants. Bus across the street. Nothing to dislike. Went snorkling on the Dolfin in Palm beach. Disliked water at the sunken ship. Too rough to snorkel. We got off the boat and right back on. Not such great snorkeling. St. Thomas much better.
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,This is a gorgeous beach with lots of white sand. Of course expect the wind to kick up some sand but it isn't too bad. The water was a great temp for swimming and gradually gets deeper. It is clean and well kept. We loved our time spent here.
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,We decided to venture off our next door Arashi Beach. Beautiful beach but as it's been windy our whole trip we ate a LOT of sand. The water is beautiful and we had no problem finding an umbrella. Biggest complaint: no bathrooms in site!!!!
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,tranquility no bothering like people selling coconuts like other caribbean destinations very pure white sandy beaches crystal clear torquies water beach not crowded free of charge to relax on the beach good for honeymooners sunset full moon you name it
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,Gorgeous turquoise waters and white sand. Great boardwalk spanning several resorts. Areas where there are lost of activities available such as parasailing or renting jet skis. And area that are quiet for those that just want to chill on the beach
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,The taxi driver took us to Eagle Beach because it was close to the ship. We found the beach clean and the water beautiful. There were some waves which I enjoy. If you only have a couple of hours to spend Eagle Beach is fine.
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,This is where the low rise boutique hotels are located. If you like intimacy and no children this is the place. A short nine dollar taxi ride into town makes this a great location.
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,Steps from the room. Gave up on getting a beach chair. All grabbed early and hoarded by experienced vacationers. Wonderful beach!
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,What a beautiful beach. What more could you ask for than soft white sand and warm water. There are so many spots along here that people just enjoy. It is fun to walk along. We found that afternoon can get quite busy.
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,Eagle Beach is much less crowded than Palm Beach where the high rise hotels are. It is quieter and relaxing. There are palapas and of course the gorgeous turquoise water!
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,Has a more waves than Palm beach has. Husband and I walked down to eagle beach and enjoyed the water . There seemed to be chairs to rent etc
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,We stayed at the costa linda and the beach front was absolutely beautiful. It was immaculate and pristine. The sand was like powder under your feet and the water was as blue as the sky. Perfection!!
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,Crystal clear waters simply paradise. A must do; you can rent an ATV and go with it to the beach itself. Loved every minute of it.
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,Just beautiful! Lots of people but never overly busy or crowded! Very clean but get there early to claim a palapa!
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,This beach is not busy and is wider than others. Well unless you are there during the flip flop festival. The waves are a bit bigger than at Palm beach so if your family likes to play in surf and have lots of space around you on beach this is a good choice.
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,We have visited the island about 12 times. Its always friendly and is one of the nicest beaches. The water was great as we spent time floating on a tube. You can't go wrong in Aruba
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,Eagle Beach was right across the road from our hotel. It was gorgeous! White sand beach water was warm.
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,Plenty of windsurfing and kite surfing. There are other beach activities too: paddle boarding jet skis kayaks catamarans snorkeling.
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,Long white sand clear blue waters - you can walk for miles on the beach. Public beach but kept very clean - no seaweed or rocks no need for water shoes. Very windy though - bring a fitted hat
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,Breathtaking...clean clear water and super silky white sand. Wonderful place to chill out and relax. Lots of shade lots of sun. The beach has lots of room for everyone so enjoy!!
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,Powder-soft white sand warm clear water fading to turquoise and clear blue sky.. What else you can ask for.. True Paradise.. Amazing! P.S There are palapaas on the beach which are first come first serve. The beach itself is very clean which make it more enjoyable. Enjoyed every minute of it!
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,Great beach; well maintained clean available activities safe swimming area (no boats racing around) and quiet ambience.
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,Just down from Palm Beach Eagle Beach sits in front of the low-rise hotels. A beautiful beach with lots of activities going on in the water.
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,Large beach soft sand. No seaweed like you find by hotels.All the beach activities you want.Water is calm and warm.
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,Large Beach area. Lots of white sand and a great view. I visited all the beaches in Aruba and Eagle beach was the best. If you are looking for white sand and beautiful water don't pass over a visit to this Beach!! you won't be disappointed.
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,Crystal blue waters and white soft cool sand invite any traveler in this beach haven. I have traveled throughout most of the Caribbean and this is one beach where vendors are not hustling you to make a dollar. you can lay on the beach all day and do what you want when you want at your leisure.
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,We love going to Eagle beach because even though there are lots of resorts on it there is more than enough room to spread out and have some privacy. It's much less crowded than Palm Beach. It's a beautiful place to go jogging either on the walkways or right at the waters edge.
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,Lots of white sand gentle waves warm water. Not great for snorkeling however. Right across a secondary road from low-rise hotels.
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,Just beautiful and amazing beach in Aruba. White sand and blue transparent water. Quite popular among tourists.
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,clean a little crowded great sunsetgreat location for restaurants and beach bars with happy hours
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,This beach was across the street from our hotel. The clear sand the beautiful view and quietness makes this a relaxing place to visit.
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,Great beach got to go if you're in Aruba. Very hot so be prepared to pay 10-15 bucks for a palapa the 15 dollar ones will give you wifi
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,Since all the beaches in Aruba is open for public what you need is to put on your swimming suits sandal and bring towel. This beautifull beach is so inviting to swim on. There is no other negatif comment I could write instead of...jump to the sea!
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,The beach and water were absolutely beautiful powder white sand and crystal blue water. A must see!
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,Sand sun and a beautiful colorful ocean ahead of you. Relaxing place to spend the day. There is not much infra though compared to palm beach
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,We took a boat ride from Palm Beach to Eagle beach. This beach is much quieter (from a people standpoint) than Palm beach. A lot less activity to choose from here. They have jet skis but for anything else you must travel to Palm Beach
g147249,d150447,February 11 2016,Calm waters. Powder white sand. Unreal colors. Not crowded. No vendors. This beach is really wide compared to palm beach. It is very quite. It doesn't have the large amount of hotels and vendors like palm beach.
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,The most amazing beach ever  never got problems with finding a place  really relaxing and a great view.
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,One of the best beaches I have ever visited. The water is crystal clear blue the sand has zero rocks and fish swimming around you it was quite an experience.
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,if you have a hotel on this beach that is half the fight. The beach is siren and peaceful and beautiful
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,This beach was a 10 minute walk from our lodging. Beautiful beach. Lots of lounge chairs and shelters available for a fee but if you arrive early 8:00 am you have the pick of chairs and shelters and may not even have to pay to use them. Clean accessible restroom.
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,Great beach beach bar and food available nice warm water water sports available chairs and unbellas and nice soft sand
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,Spent daily time on the beach under the great shady structures provided. It was never too crowed. Sand and water were great! Enjoyed walking it everyday.
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,Beautiful white sand and blue water! Can't ask for better than that! Enough room for everyone on the beach. Never feels crowded! One of my faves!
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,Our favorite beach on the island of Aruba! It is cleaned daily has lounge chairs and umbrellas security is watching area so that your visit is calm and quiet and there is plenty of room for everyone including privacy.
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,Love the peoplebeaches taxi service. Everything about the place the food was great casinosfelt very safe walking late at night everything was closes food markets clean need Say more.........
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,The beach is clean and full of fun take plenty of suntan lotion and be ready to relax. The hotel is across the street from the beach so be sure to take anything you need with you.
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,We loved this beach. The sand is so soft and such a lovely view. It wasn't crowded when we were there.
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,This beach is located in the "low-rise" hotel zone. The beach and water are breathtaking. There is a constant breeze and you are never hot. It is also not crowded. Very different from the high rise hotel zone which is jam packed with people and chairs.
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,This beach is absolutely beautiful!! The water is a beautiful Caribbean Blue and white sand...couldn't ask for any better!
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,White sand blue-green-turquoise sea... a lot of space to walk play relax. Not crowded... a perfect beach for a family friends or couples trip. I love it!
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,It was absolutely beautiful. They rented out "tents" to protect you from the sun. I spend hours people watching and enjoying the beach.
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,Open your slider walk ten feet and there you are on the sand and water. The best views ever. Beautiful sunsets and the friendliest people you will ever meet on any island.
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,The depth of the beach is amazing and it is never crowded. Miles of the softest sand that doesn't get hot. Very few rocks just occasional pieces of coral. No seaweed. Gradual slope so it's great for walking in the surf though the waves can sneak up on you if you daydream. Don't forget the sunscreen!
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,Went snorkeling right off shore and loved it. Beaches are pristine. Can be windy but the ocean is great.
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,Clean & beautiful. Nobody tries to sell you merchandise or harass you. Loved it!! Water is beautiful and would definitely go back.
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,Eagle beach is beautiful but Baby Beach at the south point if the island is the best beach on the island to float swim relax!!
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,Not sure I want to share is info.....beautiful beach white sand and unlike Palm Beach with all the high rise hotels...not crowded. No one to bother you to do anything rent anything just swim and relax. Very few bars that accept non residents at their hotel so bring a cooler.
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,It's a fabulous heavenly beach where is quiet and nice sea breeze.
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,Nothing but qhite sand and blue and clear blue water..at night breeze and views of incoming cruise ships..with a cocktail in hand..paradise
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,This beach is clean sugar sand. Beautiful! We enjoyed quick dips mostly because the beach was also a great place to hang out!
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,The beach was beautiful you can walk for miles on white sandy beach. The water was warm and a beautiful turquoise blue colour.
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,We have been going to Eagle Beach for some 20 years now. There is no finer beach anywhere in the world! The water is clear and very swimable the sand is soft and the wind just keeps blowing. I can't wait till next year!!!!!
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,Everything was just great make sure you rent a car Its a lot easier to get in and out due to security for the complex.
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,Just an enjoyable expierence and well maintained beach area by the RIU. Would go back soon if possible
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,great sand clear water beauty view. our resort had chairs so we had a comfortable visit. one of the nicest beaches ever.
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,We went here a couple times during our stay. The beach is stunning. The water is clear the sand is soft the view is beautiful. You can go to a quiet or populated ends of the beach. The famous divi divi tree is here. It's beautiful during the day or at sunset.
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,Eagle beach is the most beautiful beach on the island. Lovely views not crowded or noisy fabulous walking and swimming!
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,The view is amazing and there are some very secluded more quiet areas. Loved how you could walk for miles and always have a view of the ocean!
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,Quiet beach great place to read a book or even a little nap . As I was not staying in hotels by the sea had no place next to snack or buy drink.
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,Aruba was a stop on our cruise and we visited Eagle beach. We got on the #10 bus and for $4.00 round trip to the beach. Beach chair are available to rent there is a bar and restaurant across the street. The beach was not crowded and had a great day.
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,Adults only resort located next to public beach. Beachfront was very nice. This review must be at least 50 characters...sometimes less is more!
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,Eagle beach was fantastic for a great swim. Not so much for snorkeling but there are other places on island to do that. Great location with shade options and close to walk up beach bars. The water was lovely calm and cool. Would recommend. Also perfect for a sunset swim.
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,Open to the public very clean. Water was great. Most hotels afford you a daily shuttle. Within walking distance to most places if you don't mind walking.
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,Eagle Beach is beautiful! It is not as stuffy as the other beaches. There are some small waves and no constrictions.
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,This was by far the best beach on the island- everyone even told us so! Great hotels nearby and right on the beach.
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,It's a fantastic beach to spend your day in. Just avoid the water when it's windy because it might be a bit uncomfortable to swim unless you are a great swimmer.
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,White cool sand (trade winds keep it cool). Deep beachfront. Safe. Not crowded. Beach is public but chase lounges are owned by the hotels the open onto the beach.
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,Gorgeous beach clean perfect setting. We walked up and down this beach each day and our hotel room faced the beach. Gorgeous sunsets.
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,We stayed on three hotels on eagle beach they all had a beautiful beach area. Water is calm and sand on beach is soft and clean. It is Sometimes difficult to get a hut for shade at some resorts on eagle beach. All three hotels were just a short walk across street from eagle beach.
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,nice people. clean beach best beach on island. Good water activities Have been going there for 17 years. Looking forward to another trip there
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,This beach is spectacular. The sand is white and gorgeous. It was never crowded. There were seadoos to watch sailboats and people of course. There is a great food truck near MVC hotel super food. Sadly there was a lot of trash on the beach especially after the local evening crowd left.
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,A beautiful beach but the wind could be a bit of a sandblaster. I generally liked the wind because I never felt hot and also no bugs.
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,Gorgeous beach with bright blue clear waters. Little windy - but at 88 degrees - the wind does not matter one bit!
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,Loved the Calmness of the Water you can relax & just float. Color of Turquoise is just Awesome. Love that the Beach is steps from Hotel door & Pool so convenient
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,We really liked Eagle Beach - nice and long very clear water rather few people. Compared to neighboring Palm Beach which is considered to be "one of the best beaches in the world" by our guide book Eagle Beach was better in every respect.
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,Allocations of rooms were big mess not sure who is to blamed for. Many tourist had same problems.Hotel or Booking Agents must share the responsibilty and not creat problem for tourists.
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,The beach is outstanding. The only drawbacks were the constant wind and uncomfortable (apparently only for me) lounge chairs.
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,white sand beautiful water good walking close to all the hotels easy swimming because of the buoyancy of the saltwater.
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,Stayed at Costa Linda again this year. It was better than ever. Always a hut available on the beach (as long as you don't sleep till 10). Grounds beach rooms all maintained better than ever. What a wonderful way to relax and enjoy what we came to Aruba to find.
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,A must Go! Crystal Clear water! No seaweed no trash fine sand excellent panaramic views plenty of places for chairs
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,I disliked everything--a la carte okay food and service wise. Lower end employees try very hard.Hotelis in poor shape and severely dated.
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,The beach was lovely. There were pelicans diving around us and small tuna jumping in the morning. It would have been better if it was cleaned up each morning.
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,The tremendously wide beach has soft white sand. The waters are warm and clear. This beach looks like the pictures you see in magazines and on TV commercials to entice you to buy their products. Great for sun bathers snorkelers beach strolls and sunset watching. Simply gorgeous!
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,The beach is stunning. The white sand sun and constant breeze were wonderful. I would have liked to have seen someone cleaning the beach as trash was unfortunately starting to accumulate.
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,Absolutely the best beach ever!!! NO false advertising here. I was at the public beach which means I didn't have to rent a chair. Nice location next the Tamarijn Hotel.
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,Eagle Beach is a picture perfect beach with white soft powdery sand and truly gorgeous aqua colored ocean water. It's a gorgeous beach that is also peaceful and not crowded!
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,plenty of room. no chance for an umbrella unless you get there before 6am. Beautiful place to sit and watch the sunset.
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,The sand on this beach is very nice and the beach area is big. The water is clean and there are no rocks so entering the water is easy.
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,If you go to the southern end of this beach you will get away from the crowds from the resorts and hotels and be able to have some space to yourself. We played in the waves swam did large sand sculptures read and napped. One of the best beaches for the views and serenity.
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,We liked Eagle Beach and visited with the family in Jan 2015 Not as spectacular as the beaches on some other islands but very nice anyway
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,Beautiful white sand beach. Tons of room and access. If you are looking to sit on the sand and wade in the surf this is the place for you.
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,The beach is powdery white the surf is calm with no coral or seaweed at all. Shell collecting is abundant too. Absolutely the best!
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,This beach is made for laying out and relaxing. No real snorkeling here. Plan ahead and bring drinks books sunscreen and snacks. A true relaxing and enjoyable day. I hope you enjoy we did.
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,Beautiful Beach!! Cabanas & beach chairs available ~ friendly staff on hand & security ~ restrooms & showers close by!

g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,Yes folks the icon of aruba is alive and well on Eagle beach. There are two wind swept divi trees on the beach very near the water. I was there photographing early in the morning so I can't comment on the beach experience throughout the day.
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,The beach was excellent and clean! Loved it. My hotel was right on the beach and it truly was a pleasure to walk to the beach right from the door of our hotel. The beach was so clean that you could see your feet in the water.
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,clear beach and water you can see 20 feet down clear to the bottom. always nice sun and steady breeze to keep you cool.

g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,Beautiful sand clear water. No rocks seaweed etc. Calm surf plenty of room to spread out Quite and beautiful sunsets
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,Narrow beach that runs about 2 miles. The beach is clean and easy to access. There is a walkway that runs along the top of most of the beach near the lorries hotels.
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,I loved this place the beach is beautiful and there are plenty of restaurants bars and things to do around
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,The water so clear. The blue color was unbelieveable ! The waves were perfect and the water was so warm. The had these little huts and these cabanas you could hang out in to get out of the sun!
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,Eagle beach is great for walking and easily accessible with parking available. South from the hotels tree is a less crowded area with some shade. The beach itself is beautiful. Not as commercial as Palm Beach.
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,Great with families or couples. Lots to do and beach  food and people are great! Highly recommend this place.
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,We visited Aruba for our honeymoon and walked an hour round trip from Palm beach to visit this beach several times throughout our holiday. Very quiet and absolutely stunning beach. Manchebo happy hour is a must! Blue sea and white sand everything you could dream of - paradise
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,The best people watching beach and beach in general. Amazing waters and views! Go enjoy your in Aruba
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,this is a great beach if you like things a little more quiet. there were plenty of people however it was not crazy like the beach in the highrise area you could walk forever on this beautiful beach
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,I liked the water but there are just too many boats and touristy things crowding the beaches. When we were there someone got hit by a ride that was pulled by a boat although she was inside the 'safe" swim area. That's scary.
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,While Baby Beach is great if you have little ones Eagle Beach is by far the most beautiful beach on this island.
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,Eagle Beach is the quieter of Aruba's two main drags (with Palm Beach being the more happening family oriented set up). While Palm Beach can be quite hectic at times Eagle Beach is the polar opposite. Very few children almost completely silent just a peaceful oasis.
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,Great beach for watersports volleyball soccer running frizbee. Also pretty awesome for people watching. The beach also has a little restaurant for snacks lunch and drinks.
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,Popular/somewhat crowded beach. parking available. decent drinks and food at bar. good swimming/floating the waves.
g147249,d150447,February 10 2016,Lovely spacious soft sand and one of the best areas to hang out on the beach in Aruba. You can enjoy some waves to play and watch a beautiful sunset.
g147249,d150447,February 9 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 9 2016,We spend the whole weekend at the eagle beach swimming playing and relaxing. Was wonderful. Will go again this weekend.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,A really top notch beach in aruba on the north shore I loved staying at a hotel there. Do go there if in aruba
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Eagle Beach is ideal for relaxing or playing in the sun. In my opinion this is the best beach in Aruba. Wide open spaces clean sand and warm water. It's different from Palm Beach. Less crowded.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Must experience eagle beach. So much to see and do. Beware of lawn chairs already on beach. 15.00 each. Bring your own to save money for the local balashi beer :). Great time.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,One on the nicest sunbathing beaches we've been to Its long safe clean and access to the water is easy.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Non-intrusive hotels crystal clear water nice waves uncrowded white sand. Eagle beach is without question the best beach in Aruba's hotel area.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,A beautiful expansive beach to walk along. Many places to stop at along the way for a beverage or bite to eat. Much different than Palm Beach which can be rather crowded by beach chairs from hotel guests.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,The beach is very clean and great for walking! Water is clean clear and a lovely blue colour. I found a starfish in the water!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,I expected the beach to be a little cleaner.The waves were rough and it was windier than the palm beach area
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Lovely beach Huts available small bar with alcoholic and non alcohol drinks many water activities lunch truck with cheap filling lunch.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Busy beach but the water is gorgeous. The breeze blows constantly and I loved that. Tough to find a hut you have to get up early for that
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Great stretch of beach to walk swim or visit other resorts !!! You can walk almost 2 miles in each direction from CDM.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Nice island with good restaurants beaches scuba diving and friendly people. Road signs scarce making navigation challenging
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Eagle Beach is a beautiful beach the sand is white the water is crystal blue. The only thing I can say that would be negative is that if you're not staying at La Cabana or the Amsterdam it's difficult to find a hut. There seems to be more restaurants huts and attractions in the Palm Beach area.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Loved it!!! Loved It!!!! Beautiful Sunset's warm sands Angel fish in the waves as they came in. Clean beach super clean... Just plain great!!!! Will be headed back... Its a must...
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Wonderful beach. The color of the water is surreal it has a lot of beautiful white sand so you won't be packed like Palm Beach. Much more relaxed and calmed than Palm beach and excellent for sunsets. I recommend Passions on the Beach for a snack or drink there ;)
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Alongside with Baby Beach this is the greatest beach in the island. Quiet and beautiful it´s the best place in the island to book a hotel.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Nice beach although admittedly I just stayed within one area with our group from our excursion. Clean nearby little restaurant/bar with drink service on the beach
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Eagle beach is really great and the area around Oceania is particularity nice. You can see some beach front erosion in areas near the Divi but the area near Oceania is still pretty well intact. The sand is smooth and water is nice and calm.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,We came over to this beach to jetski and we really loved how beautiful it was. The sand here was much softer than Palm Beach however the water much more rough. We need activity around us so we are glad we didn't stay in the low rise hotel district that is on this beach.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,We stayed right across the street from Eagle Beach in July (low season). The beach is scenic and the water is warm once you get in. But there were no waves and the wind was unstoppable.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,We loved the beach it was quiet and not as crowded as near the high-rise hotel area. Played beach volleyball and just hung out. There was a rock climbing wall and jet skis for those who wanted to do it.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Beautiful beach!! Make sure to take a cab to the less populated part of it away from the hotels and resorts. You can also rent ATV's and drive to the beach. The sand is like golden brown flour and the water much clearer than palm beach where all the resorts are.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Amazing beach with white sand even in the high season not many people because it a little bit far from the hotels.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,beautiful beach great to see hotels were NOT on beach but across the rood- best for sunbathing swimming jogging; however snorkeling not great due to limited visibility and lots of jetskis.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,It seems to me that Eagle Beach was much quieter than Palm Beach where we were staying. It could be due to fewer and smaller hotels along the Eagle Beach. Few times that we ventured to Eagle Beach we noticed less crowd and less noise. We may consider Eagle Beach next time we come to Aruba.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,The sand and water is magnificent.The waves are easy to float swim and dive into.The temperature and clarity of water is perfect.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Stayed at Divi Village in Eagle Beach. Loved it! The beach is quiet and beautiful. Visited Palm Beach and quickly came to the conclusion that we would rather be here
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,outstanding beach area in the la cabana too bad food & drinks in hotel not good at all. The beach is amazing very clean & beautiful. I still go every year. Usually never reins its a guaranteed sunny vacation.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,This beach has a restaurant decent facilities and some activities. (We had a nice jet ski session here.) But it's much lower-key than Palm Beach. There are plenty of people around but not so many that you feel like you're tripping over them all the time. You can spend a nice lazy laid-back reasonably tranquil afternoon here.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Good place to lay around and relax. Okay for offerings like Para-Sailing but the wind gusts can sand blast you.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,very wide beach- lots of room- not crammed together like the narrow beaches in the Palm Beach (high rise hotel) area
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,the reort giving refund We came in Nov. and looked at the place. it was a nice place. we rented a car out and we drove the whole island. we walked on the beach it it certainly was all they say it was
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,If you like peace and quiet this is the beach for you. Very relaxing and not a lot of people on this beach. Eagle beach is open to the public and has huts and beach chairs. Food an beverages are nearby.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Lots of open sandy beaches pretty water lots of privacy great beach! Limited food options so pack a picnic!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,This beach has crystal blue waters white powdery sand and the unique Fofoti trees...Arubas' most photographed trees. Eagle Beach is a great place for a sunrise stroll there is not a better way to begin your day!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Calm water great sand plenty of room. If your not into the Palabra hanging in the shade crowd head a little farther to the south side of Eagle beach and park under the trees. More secluded and romantic.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,We just spent 18 days here! Lots of fun things to do!but yet a great place to relax! The water is very smooth and safe to swim and relax! Lots of bars and places to eat! You can't go to Aruba and not spend time here!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Excellent beach clean water I normaly don't go in the water but this beach is the exception! The sand is like powder sugar ! Beautiful sunsets you can't go wrong going to eagle beach.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Eagle beach in Aruba is my favorite place on earth I have been to most Caribbean islands and keep going back to aruba each year feels like home. Beautiful water nice sandy beach breezy all the time which is refreshing. Stay in the low rise hotels nicer beach than in the high rise expensive hotels.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,The water is calm and is the perfect blend of blues. It's so calming to just sit and look at it. Perfect to swimming or just relaxing on one of their loungers. Lots of activities offered on the beach for you out-going people.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,loved going to Eagle Beach! Sunsets were beautiful and walking the rocks was beautiful. The water was a little cold though!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Just love the beach walks morning and evening. Have viewed the sea turtles nesting and babies hatching. Kayaking snorkeling and swimming are superb. And the beach bar - bar none!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Was nice. There are activities such as jet skiing and para sailing. Part of the group went jet skiing and para sailing. The adventure was worth the price and the memory
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Eagle beach has to be one of the best beaches in the world. Soft white sand shallow surf usually calm water. Typically a nice breeze to keep you from getting too hot. Restaurants shopping. Just a great beach. Highly recommend it.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,The beach was fantastic. White soft sand with clean warm water and an occasional wave. Enjoyed all the sites while taking long long walks more than once a day. Not many rocks or shells plenty of people watching and enjoyed the pelicans.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,More local people. Liked that is wasn't a tourist trap. Was a nice drive getting there seeing othe parts of Aruba.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,This beach is very sandy and slopes gently into the sea. Good for families. It also has lots of water sports available.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,You have to see the sunrise and set. No words can describe it. Everyday its was like I was seeing it for the first time.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,White sugar sand and gentle surf under the ever-pleasant Aruba sun...what's not to love? We had a truly delightful time.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,The beautiful sand and water.Not crowded and very peaceful. The resort supplies the huts and chairs.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,See why this beach is rated in the top ten! Soft beautiful white sand and baby blue waters. The best I have ever experienced by far!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Ah the smell of no-so-fresh sewage! What a great way to inhale the beach! Not sure why they say this is a great beach....
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,What a beautiful sight for sore eyes Eagle Beach! The most beautiful part of ARUBA! Fantastic views!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Quiet huge and plenty of room. You are never too close to another person. Plenty of beach to go for a walk
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Beautiful and quiet and the restaurant on the beach was an added plus - serving lunch and drinks. Passions on the beach is a place on the beach not to miss if you want a romantic evening looking into the sunset.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,If you enjoy spending your time on the beach under a hut in Aruba then you MUST stay at a Resort on Eagle Beach
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Look up synonyms for the word ecstasy and every one pertains to eagle beach! I've been to eagle beach between 25-30 times hopefully when I pass away my wife sprinkles some of my ashes there. Its my favorite place in Aruba. Cant think of a better eternal resting place! A nicer beach you'll never find!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Definitely the beach to go to in Aruba! There is a lot of space and it was never crowded when we went there. The available palm umbrellas and chairs are a nice amenity here as well. Sand and water are perfect!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,pretty clean some rocks in the ocean like everywhere in Aruba many umbrellas for a shade not as crowded as palm beach
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Palm beach is no comparison to Eagle Beach.If you are staying in a high end hotel..brava towel..And head down to Eagle Beach...a short 5 mt. Ride. Here you will find the most beautiful sand and water.100 % clean and pure. No seaweed...or yuk. This is the dream beach you hear about when exploring Aruba.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,I love this beach soooo much it is crystal clear white sand and no rocks! If you like Jet skies they are here as well. I own at the Marriott Surf Club which is on Palm Beach-but I usually go to this beach :)
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,white sand beaches warm water great snorkeling. Rentals are reasonable along the beach for everything from snorkeling to parasailing to jet skis.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Eagle Beach is beautiful and much less crowded than Palm Beach with the high rise hotels. Some resorts have beach bars but water sports are not easily available.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,the sand is great and the water is just beautiful! The water is great with just the right size waves. Loved it!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,love this beach night and day!! fine white sand- the water is perfect! not too crowded lovely restaurant variety within walking distance.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Eagle Beach is one of the most popular beaches in Aruba. It's nice white sand clear blue & warm water gentle waves & gentle breezes make it a favourite destination. Most highly recommended!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Great white sand and perfect waters the sun was hot and you were cooled down by a perfect be achy breeze
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,We walked from Palm Beach to Eagle Beach one day during our 6 day stay at the Riu. Eagle beach seemed less crowded and the water was picturesque. A must do!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,A big beach with very warm water and precious landscapes it is ideal for a jog and spend time very quiet as well as to relax and enjoy the scenery. No doubt I will be back.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,i loved it! nice wide open beach with blue waters and white sand. Busy but not overcrowded. Bars and restaurants nearby
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Eagle Beach was exceptional. The white sand and turquoise water was outstanding. The water was so clear and warm. There wasn't a lot of people on the beach also. The only downfall is the lack of shade but one can rent an umbrella for shade.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Combines a little bit of all the other beaches. Nicer as you walk to the south. Never fails for families or couples plus the option to take photos to Fofoti trees.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,This is really a beautiful beach. The water is warm all the time. There is not much shade unless you belong to a timeshare. The perfect beach for cruise stops.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Not crowded no water sports allowed I don't think I've ever seen someone selling anything on the beach ( though all beaches in Aruba are public ). The sand is white and clean and the water is just slightly wavy.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,The beach is white soft sand that has a lot of room to relax and enjoy the sun sand & view! Great to walk on no rocks or coral to cut your feet on. You can walk for miles.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Beautiful clean private beach where Bucuti & Tara Resort is situated. Much less touristy than Palm Beach.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Terrific expanse of white sand blue water and lovely sun. This is the beach you're looking for. No high rise hotels and lots of space to spread out and enjoy the day.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,We thought the location was an excellent place to hold the event. We watched the tournament then walked the beach and jumped in the beautiful ocean!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Short drive from high rise hotels worth the trip for a walk or an entire day at the beach. They have beach chairs to rent it is a public beach and can get crowded so go early if you want a spot in the shade.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Pristine white sand and beautiful clear water....when we visited in the late afternoon it wasn't even too crowded.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Make sure you enjoy the beautiful white sand and the gorgeous colors of the water . Enjoy the warm water and the great swimming!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,To tell the truth I have no idea where Eagle Beach ends and Palm Beach begins. But I will say that the general beach area from downtown to the hotel zone is very clean and family friendly.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Most Popular beach in Aruba solely because all the best hotels/resorts are located here in the 'high rise' area. If you stay here you don't need to rent a car and go anywhere. just relax here on Palm eagle beach.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Clean beachFriendly people and staff Newer cabanas and good chairsNeed to be early to get your cabanas
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Absolutely beautiful beach! We should have stayed here! Although Palm Beach is beautiful too! Can't find a bad beach here!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,We took the public bus to Eagle Beach during a port stop in Aruba. We paid $30 for two chairs and an umbrella right on the beach. What a great day!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Were not ones who enjoy the crowds. Personally I feel that palm beach is very crowded with lots of activity daily and nightly. Eagle beach is the opposite. If you want a romantic quiet tranquil resort look to Eagle beach. If you enjoy the nightlife and water sports Eagle beach is the best option.

g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Wide beach clear water soft sand that does not get hot in the sunwhat more could you want. Weather is constant
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Eagle beach has lost about 50 yards or more due to storms or erosion. Still one of the nicest beaches in the Caribbean. Pristine white clean and hotter than heck. Rental equipment still cheap and in good condition . get there early because it gets crowded real fast
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,If I ever go back to Aruba this is probably where I will spend the majority of my time. We went to all the places marked in our travel guide but found Eagle Beach to be the Best the Island has to offer. There is one draw back.....MOSQUITO'S AROUND SUNSET. The rest of the time was really nice.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Eagle Beach in Aruba is one of the best on the island. It's clean friiendly and wider than down by the highrises. LaCabana is where we stay and it's a great timeshare. Never trade it.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,wonderful beach. Spent the day there with my family. Soft sand and beautiful water. Was able to rents recliners and an umbrella for a reasonable price. Only negative was there are not a lot of bathrooms or places to buy food or drinks. Would suggest bringing a cooler if you go.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Eagle Beach was amazing. The water was a bit cooler than we expected but it didn't keep us from enjoying it. It had just the right amount of everything!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Beautiful!!!! The views were spectacular and water activities are at your fingertips!!! I loved it all!!

g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,I travelled to just about every beach on the island and this is by far the nicest beach for swimming and relaxing. Nice and wide quiet private and the water is calm and clear. Sand is like powder under your feet.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,We stayed in the Palm Beach area but spent a day at Eagle Beach. The water is calm and completely clear. Perfect beach.

g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Eagle Beach is alive with activity places to eat and people to watch. But the beautiful water is the real attraction.

g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,

g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Have spent many more vacations of recent at Palm Beach. This year Eagle Beach has proved to be a hands down winner. Wider beaches. Hotels with fewer rooms (fewer people crowded in) and many good restaurant finds in and around. Coming back here next year.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Love the clear waters. Plenty of beach chairs. So relaxing here. Walked across the street from La Cabanna. Lots of water activities available as well. No hassle beach.

g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,crowded because its the best beach for the clean water sand and cabanas. Get there early to reserve a good location for your cabana.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,white soft sand. Clear water. not super crowded. Lovely sunsets. our area was patrolled by security so felt safe and he made sure the radios were not playing too loud.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Clean and the Water Warm. The hotel cleaned the beach daily and made sure chairs were stacked for the next day
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,awesome beach white sand warm water and great for long walks! Early mornings were a great time for a stroll or jogging because it was cooler. Listening to the waves in the dark of night as we walked was so soothing that sleep came easy. Beach was never overcrowded like some can be.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,

Wink.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Aruba is full of beaches but this beach is very nice wide open and the sea easy to go into. There are miles to walk place to practise yoga and all other sports you are able to do on the sand or in the sea.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Nice & Clean a very safe place to beach walk. Nice sunsets very relaxing. I can't wait to go back again I have been there the past 2 years
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,nice staff great activities at the pool  happy hour 3 times a day beach and poolside beautiful rooms BEST beach in Aruba!

g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,What a beautiful beach! We rented an umbrella and 2 chairs for $35 which was much cheaper than Baby Beach. We snorkeled right off the beach and saw giant starfish. Although busy you never really seemed to be tripping over people. There are spots less busy than others all along the beach.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Only one word to describe this beach. SPECTACULAR. If you are not staying at one of the resorts across the way there is not much shade.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,this was the nicest sand we walked on. Chairs came with our hotel and this was the only beach they didn't have rules against bringing your own drinks.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Sand here is like Confectioners sugar. the beach is private quiet serene AMAZING!!!!!! My favorite beach in the world!!!! I do like the hotels in the high rise area better but by far Eagle beach is the better and more luxurious beach compared to Palm Beach!!!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,LIKE: Resort I stayed in was waterfront. DISLIKE: It was hard trying to find seating and shade. You have to come out at SUNRISE just to get a decent spot. I later discovered that people were 'hogging' shady spaces for days at a time by not taking their stuff back to their rooms. The resort did not address this issue.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Wonderful clear water smooth and relaxing! Beautiful sunset views! Probably our favorite / second favorite beach visit we have had in the last five years ( after being to St. Thomas St. John Punta Mita Nevis St. Kitts and Cabo Costa Rica)
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Soft sand....most beautiful blue water. Plenty of places to sit. Waiters on the beach are very attentive.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Beautiful beach soft sand and although the weather was in the 90s the sand was never too hot to walk on. We cant wait to return to Eagle Beach.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,What a beautiful beach! The sand is so white and the water is amazing--so clear and calm! The colors are stunning! This is a great place for relaxing and people watching!

g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,quiet peaceful amazing beach clean water is perfect...not to wavy or not to calm...the sunsets on this beach were unforgettable
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,We stayed at La cabana so the beach is right there. Eagle beach is quite often voted in the top ten beaches in the world and there is good reason why. The water is always calm and clear and they clean the beach every day.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,The color of the water is magnificent! So clean and beautiful. We saw fish star fish conch ..... amazing all around! Can't wait to go back!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Clean beautiful and quiet. We loved this beach best of all because there was very few others on the beach except us from the Bucuti and the CasaLinda next door. It was clean water and romantic too! Only beach I'd ever go to!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Fantastic for early morning stroll as the sun comes up and beach is pristine. Turtle hatching sites are well identified and protected
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Palm beach is nice but crowded. Eagle beach is a very wide soft sand beach with beautiful aqua waters that is much quieter than Palm beach. We loved it!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Great beach with very nice sand. The sea is nice to take a swim but for snorkeling I recommend to go to Arashi or Boca Catalina.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,My wife and I loved the laid-back and romantic atmosphere. The beaches were beautiful and not over crowded. The food was amazing everywhere we went. The people was friendly and the service was impeccable.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,It is a beach so what can you say? Beautiful crystal clear water and lots of sand so have no concerns heading here...

g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,White Sand Clean Quiet. Eagle beach is a public beach as are all the beaches in Aruba. I would recommend this beach to everyone.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Beautiful white sand. Beach slopes quite steeply. Good swimming although water a bit cloudy. Cordoned off swimming area to keep jet skis and boats out. Some sections are busier than others depending on size of resort.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,this beach is amazing and very calm you can sit out in it and float for hours and just drink and relax
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,#1 rated beach in the carribean #2 rated beach in the world.. very clean. passion's beach bar. julio watersports... directly across the street from La Cabana Resort.

g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,You can't beat this beach. The sand and water are beautiful and no one bothers you trying to sell something. There are umbrellas on the beach with chairs available for the asking.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Water is clean. Sand is so white. Palappas at the Hotel are always available. Nothin better than a Miami Vice!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Pristine white sand. No motor or water vehicles. Gentle trade wind keeps the temps down. Water is crystal clear
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Beautiful white sand beach! It was not crowded at all! Staying at the Amsterdam Manor right across from Eagle Beach you could use the lounge chairs for free and also the cabanas were free
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Not only the best beach in Aruba the best beach ANYWHERE!!! Beatiful white sand crystal clear blue water.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Easily the best beach on the island. Clear water - sandy - no rocks - great location ! Love Eagle Beach !!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Soft cool sand and get clear water. Love this beach. The water is clear far out into the ocean. The hotels really take care of the beach and there is plenty of space. Keep your eyes open for the thong wearers.......lol
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,we have stayed in different places in aruba.and find that the best is eagle beach. it has NO rocks when u walk in the sand is soft and has the cleanest waters in aruba. the high rises have smaller beaches.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,you will have a wonderful at Eagle beach as the water is so clear clean and warm to swim no wave whatsoever best for snorkeling
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Amazing peaceful quiet serene and beautiful wide stretch of beach on Aruba! The beach was awesome and the water was perfect for swimming. Gorgeous sunsets and sunrises.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,There was plenty of beach for everyone as it is very wide. The waters are crystal clear and turquoise colored.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Eagle beach was one of the more nasty beaches we visited. Compared to palm beach it was boring dirty contraction everywhere and just not a good time. Head north for all the nice stuff.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Eagle beach is beautiful peaceful and absolutely stunning. The water is beautiful. I really enjoyed it and looking forward to revisiting and lounging on the great beach.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,This beach is the best in Aruba it is quite coral sands with beautiful sunsets. there are also pelicans diving for fish next to you
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,If you have ever been here you know how beautiful this beach is. If not you have to check it out. Had a car so was able to park at the end away from the hotel's. So peaceful here just love it. So
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Beautiful white sand and crystal clear water. You can easily spend the day floating in the water at Eagle Beach.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,This is one of the most amazing beaches in the world very beautiful location but no crowds. I will always come back.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,The beach is OK but you have to pay for chairs unless you are staying at the hotel across the street. The only beach in Aruba you can rent jet skis. They will bargain with you if you push it. They wanted $70 for 40 minutes. I offered $60. They accepted. Very limited area to use them though.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,I enjoyed my time on Eagle Beach but still prefer Palm beach in Aruba - by a slight amount. Both are beautiful with crystal clear water - Enjoy boith during your stay!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Beautiful beach were you can walk about 2 miles along the beach. Great sunsets. White sand and clean. Quieter than Palm beach.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,There were palapas available if you got there to "reserve" them by 0800. Otherwise spend the day baking. Lots of bars and restaurants but we didn't enjoy the crowds.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Loved it much better than Palm Beach which is right up the road. Palm Beach was too crowded. Great place to watch the sunset too. I recommend getting lunch at the food truck if it is open.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,White sands brilliant sun and a lovely water welcomes your every minute. This is a not to be missed place if you visit Aruba. Its not too busy. Its very clean. I bet you can't count the many different blues of the water.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,We visited Eagle Beach twice now staying at the Costa Linda resort. The beaches are absolutely beautiful with crystal clear water and white sand. There aren't waves making the water perfectly clear.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Stayed a couple days after a cruise line mishap. Had a lot of fun. Beach is beautiful not overly crowded and lots of eating places nearby. The sunsets are amazing.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,This is a beautiful soft sand beach. You’ll find the famous Divi Divi trees at the northernmost point across from Amsterdam manor. There’s a lot of space to spread out. The surf was calm when we were there. I’d look elsewhere to snorkel this is the type of beach you want to lay out and enjoy the sun.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Eagle Beach is a very beautiful beach. Depending on the day and the waves you can go sea glass and sea shell collecting or just enjoy the sun and the scenery.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,We had the good fortune to be able to stay at the Aruba Beach Club and walk the beautiful Eagle beach. Water crystal clear and loved the pelicans diving in for their meal!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Usually quiet and empty beach white sand beautiful clear water enough palapas to sit under. Sometimes it does get noisy due to locals playing loud music via huge speakers/bass from their cars.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,For a public Beach it is the crème-de-la-crème in Aruba! The water is warm the grading gradual so you can go out fairly far and still touch bottom!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,A few locals sometimes visited playing loud music but thats how it is. The beach is really beautiful  nice and clean
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Beautiful beach with plenty of rolling waves. So much fun to body surf in! Plenty of soft white sand. No seaweed!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,beautiful beach and water...safe to walk around to other resorts..plenty of water rentals and activities to do
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Beautiful wide beach. Plenty of room to set up chairs for the day without being on top of everyone else. Other than the barge off in the distance the view is ocean as far as you can see.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Eagle beach is located with in the low rise district so the amount of people is less than that of the high rise area. Also the beaches are bigger and during the off season we could always get a bungalow to sit under.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Hung out there but it was HooooT in the Aruba sun - take lots of water with you and ice if possible. Bus connection with downtown or the high rise hotel area is very convenient.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Blue sea with a beautiful sandy beach. No seaweed. Clear warm water. A safe beach with miles of white sand.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Loved to walk every morning along the beach. Very clean no seaweed or rocks. Visited other Hotels had breakfast at the Ritz!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Stayed at Casa Del Mar entering & exiting water very difficult . Walk down to Costa Linda Beach for a swim!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,clean water perfect and beautiful color there was nothing I didn't like about this beach! I highly recommend if you go to Aruba this beach MUST be visited!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Clean sand warm clear azur water mild waves makes this a wonderful place to vacation. The beach is long enough to get in a good walk or jog. It looks like something out of a travel magazine.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Located in the Low rise districts in Aruba it is no surprise that some of the original resorts located there. It is a flat wide and relatively calm beach. It is a nice place to swim job walk and stop by Ricardo's in Aruba Beach Club or Mathew's at CDM for a drink while you stroll the beach.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Fantastic beach anytime of day. Gets busier on weekends when locals come down with their families. But in two weeks we never experienced any overcrowding.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,lovely beach but to me not enough cover it is very hot between 11-2ish and us Brits need to have shelter but that's the only fault
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,This beach was not crowded and it excellent for newlyweds or older couples wishing a quiet private experience. As mentioned the water and sand were beautiful to say the least.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Nice but not Cayman Islands. The beach is just ok Go there first because once you experience Cayman you will never go back. Food in this area is not locate and again just ok.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,It's a beautiful and clean beach  very spacious for family games!!! We spend 10 days and love it!!!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,The beach was beautiful...the wind made it hard to enjoy...but I didn't mind being beat by the sand...I could of stayed out on the beach all day
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Beautiful calm clean. Great with beautiful sand and gorgeaus and colorful sea. They offer food and water sports but very organized. No complains
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Everything was good. We enjoy the beach the restaurants and the relaxation. The worst thing was leaving
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,nothing to see underwater. but great for swimming. calm low depth. warm as can be. its the beach that the Ritz and Marriott Hotels share. so its beautiful.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Calm water white sand and no crowds. Plenty of palapas and one of the nicest beaches on the island along with Arashi beach.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Very peaceful beach but the water was a bit rough compared to other beaches on the island. Expect a more laid back beach as opposed to the water sports and kids running around everwhere. Perfect with a cooler of drinks and a shaded lounge chair.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,White sand a bit windy overall a nice clean beach. Make sure you wear lots of sunscreen. Aruba is very close to the equator and you can get burnt easily. Don't miss the sunsets there.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Absolutely loved how powdery the sand was. We didn't stay on the beach but walked it a few times at sunset. Absolutely beautiful. We were happy to find a few blowholes at the end by the Amsterdam Manor. Only negative the wind kicked up a few times during our walk and we got sandblasted--not sure how frequently that happens.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Eagle beach has pristine white sand for miles. The beach is quiet but also offers motorized sports in various areas. This end of the beach lacks the full on party scene but has areas where there are bars and entertainment available if you so desire.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,The sands were soothing and the beach had a bit of a surf which made it great for boarding and swimming
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Lovely beach just across from our resort Paradise Beach Villas. Good for swimming not for snorkeling.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Loved this beach and the area. The sand is soft and white. No problem finding parking. Public transportation is available. I did not see any bathrooms or changing areas.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Beautiful calm beach! Wonderful beach to swim and relax. It was fun to watch all thr paddle boarders and activities happening around us.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,There is surf most of the time and some drop offs but it is a great beach! Shade is available and there is a bar on the beach.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Quiet and peaceful. If you are looking for a quiet place this is where to go. The waves are calm and the sand is so white and soft. If you are looking for action this is not the place.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,the water is amazing along with the views. only think that i didn't like were the jet skis....too much noise.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Beach was beautiful with little huts right on the sand. We took a walk almost every day and swam in the water.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,God what a beach!!! I thought I was in paradise. Super clean water and sand. Water temperature just fine. You can walk along the beach as it is not crowed at all. Here you forget everything stressing. Is just you and nature.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,We loved this beach a lot of locals! Good umbrella and beach chair service! The water is amazingly clear good for basic snorkeling.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Beautiful water sand and uncrowded. Great to relax read or swim or just walk along the beach. Good for families.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Like most beaches in Aruba the water is beautiful and very clean. Whats different is there are hardly any crowds plenty of room to spread out. There is a small stand over by The La Cabanana Resort selling drinks. The beach offers some of the most beautiful sunsets.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Very windy but the waves and sea colour were amazing nothing really to dislike unless you don't like the wind? Worth a visit
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,We stayed at the Marriott Stellaris and the beach is beautiful and calm. Sand is soft. Perfect view of the sunset!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Eagle Beach is the best-known and largest in Aruba. Tourists and locals pass each other and smile. No Hawkers- ever in Aruba! Never crowded like the High-Rise area of Palm Beach. Just gorgeous white sand and One Happy Island!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,As opposed to crowded and small Palm Beach Eagle has room to spare. Always clean with beautiful white sand and moderate surf. Safe for kids.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Fantastic beef. Everything was great!. Atmosphere was great and the servers very accommodating. Drinks were good also.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,If you are lucky every day will be this great. Eagle Beach is so calm and beautiful. Come for the day. Stay for the sunset.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,This beach is absolutely stunning. White sand and crystal clear water make it Eagle Beach one of a kind. This part of the Island compared with Palm Beach it's a lot more relaxing which was perfect for my mom and I.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,The beach is famous but is true: this beach is so beatiful and so deep that you van understand why so often is the beach of the year. The water is clear somteime in thi period alga are growing in the bottom.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,This Beach it is not only gorgeous but also you have in hand all services you will want (Bar Food Bath shadow and sleeping chairs). Worth the visit!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Love the water and clean beach - Not happy with people "saving" huts by placing things there and only arriving on beach at noon!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,When you step onto Eagle Beach you are leaving the real world and entering a postcard. The sand is so soft and white; the water aqua blue and inviting. This is the quintessential Caribbean beach and you will not be disappointed.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Pleasant not crowded beach. Lot of space but strong winds that carry sand which pinch once in a while. Soft sand but waters not as clear as many of the other beaches.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Beautiful Clearwater beach on Aruba. Had a great time on the beach with powder white sand and lots of huts and chairs.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Walked here one day from our hotel on Palm Beach. It is great to walk along the beaches in Aruba and Eagle Beach is lovely. We sta for a while and because we only had towels but no sunbeds we found that we were getting a lot of sand blown on us. Other than that it's great
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,This beach is all fine white sand 100 yards wide and meticulously clean. The waters of the Caribbean are generally quite tranquil warm clear and a beautiful aqua blue.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Go to Eagle Beach and stay at a smaller hotel like Bucuti and Tara. It was pristine soft sand clean not crowded and calm waters!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,White sand plus the biggest beach around it was quiet and peaceful along with a great place to play or swim in the ocean.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,My god Aruba is windy...women with decently long hair...this is absolutely annoying. Bring a head dress to keep your sanity.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,We love the large stretch of beach with plenty of room for sports 50+ huts and attendants with lounge chaises. We spent almost every day relaxing here on each of our 4 trips to Aruba. It's a picture perfect paradise like you see in movies or photographs.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,this beach is really beautiful. soft white sand water is very warm. easy wave even for me whom never learned to swim until early 20th. my hobby and I enjoyed the water since i could join him. walking along the eagle beach morning and late afternoon is so calm and peaceful.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,At this beach you can only swim and get a drink and a tan. I'm more active and got bored after 10 minutes. Fot the rest it was clean and the personel was friendly and helpfull like everywhere on the island.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Loved the resortwonderful roomsso clean. Very helpful staff. Enjoyed dinner for two with champagne delicious food and dessert. Best night for two!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Love Eagle Beach...white sand and beautiful water just makes you want to sit on the beach all day and relax...
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Beautiful beach white sand and beautiful water. Very quiet beach at Bucuti where we stayed. Probably the prettiest beach I have ever seen.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,I can easily say that this was my favorite. I had a palapa with lounge chairs electricity to re-charge. A bar with free Wi-Fi. Perfect to spend a day here just relaxing with a good book a good drink and of course the beach. It is clean and the sand is powder white and so soft. Ready to go back!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Beautiful Beach totally spoilt by the High Rise Hotels Thousands of Sunbeds edge to edge and Motor Water Sports. If that is what you are looking for you will love it - not for us.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,All beaches are public in Aruba and the local people took pride in making sure visitors felt welcome. The beach is clean and has good amenities. Something for everyone: white sands blue sea water sports and a pier with bar also. Lovely location and all activities that a run from there are cost effective.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Some part of this beach are near the water treatment site providing some foul smells... but beach is perfect and thats not the beach's fault either! lol
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,This wide pure white beach just has to be the best beach in Aruba. We were told it is white because it was naturally made from coral. When we ere there in July 2014 we were lucky enough to see a turtle nest hatch in broad daylight.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,This beach is less crowded than the High Rise area and has gentle waves for floating on rafts tubes etc. Miles and miles of beautiful soft white sand!!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,My family and I travel a lot especially down south so we know a thing or two about beaches. Eagle Beach was by far the most beautiful and relaxing (so far).
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Stayed at the Bucuti and Tara and the beachfront was beautiful! White sand and pristine turquoise water.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Simply beautiful. Shopping restaurants clubs & gambling. Picture perfect. Very relaxing. Have been to Aruba 3 times & def will go back.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,no commercial activity pure peace white sands cool winds a wonderful place to relax relaxing wonderful
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Soft white sand beautiful water. One of the best beaches I've been to. Not too many palm trees but many places have palapas to sit under.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Not crowded like beaches by hi-rise area water gets deep enough to swim in soft sand without shells to step on
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Very pretty uncrowded beach with calmer water with little waves. Turquoise water. When we were there it was a little rougher for a couple of days with a little step down into the water and some pieces of coral at the step down area. Then the water got calmer and less coral.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Beautiful beach. The water is so pretty and so calm. The days we were there it was only one day the red flags were out for no swimming. Beautiful sand and lovely sunsets!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Beautiful clean and quiet beach. No people annoy you to buy things. Most relaxing week I've spent anywhere. You could literally spend all day relaxing on lounge chairs watching sail boats go by
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,From our balcony at the Marriott we could take in all the action on Eagle beach from kite surfing to tubing water skiing and kayaking. The beach was clean and heavily trafficked Designated swim areas were marked. My only complaint was the level of boat traffic just beyond the swim area made snorkeling dicey.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,This was the greatest beach soft white sand easy access to the water. Not very crowed. We loved it.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,We have a timeshare at La Quinta which is located on Eagle beach. Never crowed like Palm beach beautiful water and white white sand.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,The beaches were clean and family friendly. There were watersports available if you wanted to play and bars if you wanted refreshments.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Great beach for long walks and stopping at local Cabana Huts for a cool drink and some local food. Very scenic beach lots of activities para sailing ski jets tubing. Very reasonable to rent lounge chairs and beach umbrellas. A must stop every year.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Super nice clean beach with beach chairs and cabanas to use. Great for families too. No waves and great sand.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,I love the water and the color in Aruba is just so beautiful. The ocean is so clean and clear. A little sea weed but not much and the sand and huts are just so inviting. Love Eagle Beach... miss it so much after one month of not being there!!!!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,La Cabana has nice shaded chairs there for people staying there. Nice sand and lots of space to move about. Water was clear but not much to see in the water.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Loved this beach the beach is beautiful water crystal clear and just gorgeous no complaints and we look forward to coming back!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,We were very impressed that Aruba put barricades around turtle nests on the beach. Beautiful beach with clean calm water.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Most beautiful beach I've ever seen. Long white sand beach on perfect turquoise waters. Really quiet and easy to just sit out in the sun all day.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Almost every day we ended up at Eagle Beach. It's clean and wide enough to ensure there is enough space in between you and the other people. Arriving in the morning you can also enjoy the public palm umbrella. Occasionally there was some brown see weed but most of the time the water was clear
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Great beach and it is not hot sand due to the sand being broken down sea shells (what our tour guide told us). Best view for sunsets. Best beach in the hotel district.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Nice beach but very sharp drop off from shoreline and a bit cluttered with brown seaweed. Watch out for jet skiers that get way too close to the shore line. Not much in the way of beach rules or patrol.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Secluded clean and close to everything. Eagle beach is like having your own beach without any commercial businesses intruding. Great place to stay when in Aruba and ideal beach to frequent. Palapas usually available when I was there.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,We stopped here for a beach break while on a jeep tour with ABC Tours. Beautiful water clean white sandy beach nice shaded tree area by parking. Would recommend for an easy access free to the public beach. No restrooms or restaurants in a short walk but they are not far.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,loved the islandthe hotelthe beachthe oceanthe peopleand the food !Stayed at the right placevery crowded(booked) but very convenient
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Powdery white sand gentle turquoise water. Look for turtles hatching in August. Palapas were great.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,This possibly the most beautiful beach I have seen Grand Turk has wonderful water- but the beach here is the very best!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Lovely quiet beach. Pristine condition amazing. My husband and I stayed near here and used it each day. I cant believe how quiet it was compared to Palm beach area.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Great Beach - white sand and really clean. Not many people making it a great place to catch up on some reading and sunning
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,This is what people expect of a Caribbean beach...sandy wide palm trees palapas clear water...not too many places to eat/drink or use bathrooms however...and can be crowded on weekends.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Powder white sand calm water for swimming and turquoise waters! This beach is so good that I am not surprised of the amount of popular hotel chains represented.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Great beach that is not over crowded by all the people in the high rise area. This beach was super clean & easy to get to.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Beach and craft market was a nice visit. Public transportation is available at good prices. Very close to hotel. No traffic; rental car accessible.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Eagle beach is much more quiet and secluded compared to most of the other beaches on the island. It's a big beach with plenty of room if you get there early enough you can access public lounge chairs. Only down side is the closest food and drink is almost a 10 minute walk. Def pack a bag!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,wonderful beach with white sand. The water so clear..very lovely. perfect for relaxation. cleansafe=go and enjoy
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,People litter some on the beach. Can't believe folks do that sort of thing in beautiful places like Aruba.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,During our late June visit there were turtle nests dotting the beach. Hoping to see some turtle eggs hatch! Soft lapping waves aquamarine water not crowded warm water nice breeze. What more can one ask?
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Eagle Beach is one of the best . The water is clean and clear as well as the sand. Even though tourism as grown over the years the beach at La Quinta is still not crowded. The bus stops are at the beach as well . The sign says Bushalte
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,A great beach with golden brown sand and touquise water. A short drive from the high rise hotel area and a very short walkcross from the low rise hotel area.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Beautiful tranquil white sand and not very many people at all along with magical azure crystal clear water . Just paradise !!!!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,We loved Eagle Beach! It was beautiful and so much quieter than the hi-rise area. It was very clean and there were many turtle hatchings in the area. :)
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Beautiful beach with silky white sand. Not crowded when I was there. All the beaches in Aruba were great!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,I enjoyed staying on Eagle Beach. You get the beauty of Aruba's beaches without the craziness and crowds of the high rise district.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,This is one of the most beautiful beaches I've ever seen. It's a great place for a morning walk! There don't seem to be too many tourists so it isn't too crowded. One end of the beach has resorts but the other end is more natural with divi and palm trees lining the back of the beach.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Played golf at Divi Village. Great 9 hole course. DO NOT DO THE TIME SHARE presentation. Besides the golf nothing really to do on Eagle beach.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Smooth entry calm waters. What more could you ask for? Beautiful sunsets clouds permitting. Rare shells on the beach however a little way out in the water and you can find smaller ones for you fellow shell trollers.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Eagle Beach is the "quiet" beach. It is away from the high rise hotels and is never crowded. No one bothers you to rent a wave runner or buy anything. I love this beach and always hate to leave Aruba and the crystal clear water and white sandy beach.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,We traveled the second week in June the beach was not crowed at all. The sand is very soft it makes you feel as if you are walking on a soft-pillow top.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Soft white sand with no rocks to stub your tootsies on. No big drop-offs into the water so it was easy to get in and out. This year we had a little more seaweed than usual probably due to some storms at sea. It was pretty windy during our trip but it kept you feeling cooler in the hot sun.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,We especially enjoyed Eagle beach. It was clean and did not have any wash up like the other nearby beaches. It was also quieter and did not seems as busy as Palm Beach.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,This beach is mostly frequented by families there is enough space among the beach umbrellas free fresh water to drink free showers and restrooms. There are no waves on this beach just choose a spot rent your chairs (US$ 1000 each) and take a rest.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,The beach is inviting nice white sand open spaces beautiful crystal blue ocean; not a lot of wave action; there are some vendors offering beach chairs and umbrellas for your convenience. About 5 miles from cruise port.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Eagle Beach is always clean well manicured and never overcrowded. Come down enjoy the water the breeze and the sand. it makes it easy to relax - totally. We have been going there for the past 8 years and were fortunate enough to buy a week right across the street at LaQuinta.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Was there with my family and extensions. Calm ocean clear water if not see through but at least could see within. Took my kids in and had a great time. Ample shade around with wild plants and huts. Safe and clean! Remember suntan lotion 50+
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,The whitest sand the crystal-clear water: if spending a day on the beach is your thing this is the place to go. Eagle Beach is on the leeward side of the island so conditions for swimming are good.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Excellent place to vacation! Our 4th time and we will be back !! People are so friendly and welcome you with open arms. The food is excellent the best seafood. The Marriott Stelliars is a great place to stay !!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Went on a cruise and ask to go to Eagle beach. We were their on a Sunday very quite. The water was warm. Waves were lite so my kids could enjoy it as we'll very nice
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Many good restaurants and bars in the area. Shopping was available in the afternoon and evening. Water is crystal clear and the beach is beautiful.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,This is the best beach I have ever been on. The water temperature is perfect the steady breeze keeps you cool and the sand is very clean and beautiful.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Very quite not a lot of people. The water and sand were wonderful. Plenty of parking. It was amazing.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Excellent too view sunrise and sunset. Sea Turtles early morning hours entering the water. Chairs and umbrella huts from the resort is setup for guest.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Eagle Beach is the best in Aruba. Sand is white and is always cool no rocks. Beach is very clean and not overcrowded. Take your snorkel and walk right from your lounge chair into the beautiful blue water. The view of the sunsets are also quite nice from here.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,You can snorkel and swim in cleaner waters than going to Palm Beach. Palm Beach is very crowded as several hotels are on the beach and the water at Palm Beach is dirty.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Calm and beautiful beach plus water sports are easily accessible. Jet skiing was a blast. We had so much fun.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,There is a reason I saw this beach on travel channels top ten beachs! it's just that nice. Vollyball and water sports down far end. Plenty to do. Surf is more often calm than rough.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,This is our second time to Aruba. I love this beach. Beautiful sand. Calm waters. Prettiest sunsets on earth. Love!!!!!! I miss it already!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,This is the best beach on the island. Beautiful white sand calm Caribbean waters and just awesome! Love it!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Very beautiful the Water was clear but the sediment was not appealing. We were able to get free chairs and cabanas directly in front of our resort (La Cabana) however we tried to go further down and were told that we would be charged $15/chair.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,We stayed at Divi Aruba and went to Eagle Beach every day. The white sand is like talcum powder and the beach is so big you are never overcrowded. We loved it.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Eagle Beach is serene peaceful relaxing and walking along the coast is heavenly. Don't forget to wait until sunset to get a great picture.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Absolutely fabulous. Uncrowded and quiet. Also stayed at Bucuti and Tara and could not have been happier.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,This beach was incredible. I have never seen anything like it. We stayed at La Quinta Beach Resort. The area the resort had dedicated to there visitors was absolutely out of this world. We never had to wait for a hut or chairs and it was extremely quiet with little or no people. Not crowded at all.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Loved Eagle Beach! It's not wavy and a great place to snorkel. I is encompassed by a reef which both brings fish and keeps the waves down. Bring your snorkel!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Fine white sandy long stretch of beach. Absolutely beautiful! You can walk for miles swim gorgeous aqua blue waters & lay on clean grounds. During our visit we checked out the barriers for the turtle nests.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,White sand water is different shades of blue cool and refreshing waters temperature and just beautiful. A little windy not a lot just refreshing and is very nice. Is a must when you are in Aruba
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Eagle is a near-perfect beach with very gentle water and many palm trees blowing in the breeze. Some part of the beach have loud music from vendors selling water activities.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,We loved Eagle Beach. Our hotel was on Palm Beach but several days we drove over to Eagle Beach for a less crowded relaxing day. There was Palapas and chairs to rent it was perfection.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,White sand water is different shades of blue cool and refreshing waters temperature and just beautiful. A little windy at times but the breeze most of the time is very nice.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,This is the best beach we found for walking/running/swimming. Very clean and wide beach. I ran the beach every morning about 7am and not many people out yet - it was great.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Amazing sand and water great sunsets not crowded. Can't be beat. Walk for miles in either direction.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Amazing white sand marks this as perhaps one of the cleanest beaches I have seen. (Cancun Antigua St Kitts St Marten) It only lacks the shade and huts that you would want the sun is STRONG!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Definitely not the Jersey shore. Clean shell free close to the water which is clear and clean too. You can rent equipment and go for a ride.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Clean peaceful even with tourists on the beach a great place to lay back and get some sun or a nap as the breeze blows constantly over you and the waves slowly crash the beach
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Sand is soft powder and rarely gets hot. Water is cool and clear and you can see your feet. Area is fenced so no fish (jelly or sharks) can get in swim area.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Just a short trip down the road from Palm beach same great beach but a little less crowded. Public beach bring a picnic and your own towels.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Eagle Beach is home to several hotels and resorts yet the beach remains uncrowded and spectacular. Wide sandy beach with beautiful green water. Great for walking. Waves are not large.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Beautiful white sand beach quieter than the high rise area very relaxing and sunset while sipping a cocktail was heavenly.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,The sand the waves the beautiful water - you could expect nothing more beautiful. We would love to be there everyday.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,I liked the clear clean water and soft white sand. I especially liked that it was very close to Paradise Beach Villas where I was staying and that I never had to fight over a lawn chair or umbrella! Gorgeous sunsets too!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,We spent a week here - staying across the street at the La Quinta. Not at all crowded we even had it to ourselves on occasion. Cleanest beach we were on all week. To get away from the crowd...go to Eagle Beach.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Clear sand warm clear water very hot. Friendly staff from the Paradise beach villa there to reserve chairs for guest. Not much to see in snorkeling though.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Not as clean as it once was and ons of seaweed makes it not so pleasant to swim in. Very crowded as well but we had nice long walks every morning which helped somewhat.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Absolutely one of the best beaches I have been too. Beautiful soft sand not overly crowded. Great for families or couples.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Beautiful spacious beach. There was no crowd what so ever on New Years eve. It is a few miles from downtown so it was quiet and relaxing. Close to many hotels and the casino area. I would only come back to this area of Aruba in the future!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Nice beach and worth the visit. A short commute from the hotel. The sand and water are nice but nothing extra from the hotel property. You can walk or take a cab to Eagle Beach but walk is better.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Crystal clear water. White soft sand (feels like baking powder). Gorgeous Fofoti trees and NOT too many people. Must be one of the most beautiful beaches in the world.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Unspoiled and free of debris and nice for snorkeling. All places to rent chairs or walk and stop to shop or swim. Friendly people
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,This is a beautiful beach for swimming but not so great for snorkling. Take a dip hang out on the beach and work on a tan. Whatever you do do it here.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,The water can be a bit rough sometimes. So amazingly stunning! The sunsets are a gift from God. I cannot believe the pictures I got. Absolute heaven!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,And a really nice bar/restaurant opposite Amsterdam Hotel (beautiful for dinner on beach at night). Water calm and lots of fish swimming around which makes it fun.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,It has nice white sands and turqoise water but not as calm as Seven Mile beach in Grand Cayman. Alot of cabana to sit under. Easy to get to and not crowded.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,This is a beautiful beach. As you enter it can be crowded but make a right and walk a little and the beach is less crowded.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Beautiful sunsets quiet (no children) great service from the Elements Bar Staff. Plenty of space and we never had a problem finding an umbrella and chairs.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Nothing really wrong here. Less sand water more choppy. It seems activities moved to Palm Beach. There are a lot of closed store fronts on the Main Street.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,They transported us to Eagle Beach for Jet Ski FUN !! It was Just GREAT. We loved the service and the Price !!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Clean beach with soft white sand. The water is warm and blue. It is vacant of touristy shops or lots of honky tonk types of eateries. Anyone can use the beaches in Aruba as there are no private beaches allowed. This beach is much quieter than Palm beach in Aruba. I highly recommend it.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Just post card beautiful! Turquoise water white sand and lots of parking available. Hotel across the street is the main amenity. More open and remote beach.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,veru nice...lots of shells....so watch your feet.....if you got out of the hotel beaches.....lots of rocks and shells......all kinds of activities to use...from kite surfing to pull behinds
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Make sure you put on the sunblock right away and re-apply after swimming! Almost every tourist we saw looked like a cooked lobster after their first day there!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,The beach was gorgeous. powder white sand with emerald blue water. Better than the pictures and best of all it was very clean and not overly populated.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,very clean not tooo crowded.just a pleasant place to lay out get some sunsoak up some sudsand have fun
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,It was right across the street from our property. It is quiet and relaxing. If I were more of a sun person I would have spent more time there.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,I loved this beach. You can walk the entire beach if you enjoy walking - it is probably 3-4 miles long. The sand is soft it can be windy but doesn't stop you from enjoying it.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,All public beaches are inundated with tests port a johns with generators running during the weeks around Easter.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,The beach is huge pristine white and offers several options for waster sports. There have beach chair and umbrella rentals on site. EAGLE BEACH was recommended on trip advisor. The locals recommended BABY beach but it was on the other end of the island.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Nice sand. Great sunset. Makes for a nice walk in the morning. We stayed near the beach and walked it regularly.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,The beach is really beautiful and calm. It's good to go with kids because there is no waves. I recommend stay in front of the Amsterdam Hotel because you can rental chairs use the bathroom and eat something.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Felt like we had the beach to ourselves. Even had the pleasure of seeing the guarded turtle eggs nest. Although the beach can be a little rough we still had a great time beach was clean not crowded and had great sun sets.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Smooth sand beautiful surroundings gorgeous sunset some wind lots of sport activities. Did a sunset sail from our beach at Marriot Ocean Club..plenty of wind and kite surfing!!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,It was clean..white sand..not crowded at all! The beach is very pretty. I would have liked more time here.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,The beach was very clean. It's the kind of beach that you can walk for a long time. We were able to find a spot to sunbath even in the busiest part of the day.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,pristine waternice white sand and the stunning Bright Sun. The wind helps keep the heat down to a superb bearable warmth. But don't let that fool you please keep the Sunscreen on at all times.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Lovely spot very busy snorkeling was ok. Closer to town if you are in Palm Beach (High Rise) area you can take a bus.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,It's very large. There isn't lot of protection for the sun. But it's good to get something different. I'll prefer other ones
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Eagle beach has the best Beach and best white sands the place is very nature orientated we absolutely loved it
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,So peaceful beach is gorgeous great staff and very little kids. So much room on the beach you are not crowded like other places or other islands.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Eagle beach is theist pristine beach in Aruba. Sift sand and gentle waves are the daily facts. Best place to chill and relax. Watch your worries disappear. By the way I love Eagle Besch
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Beautiful beach white sands warm weather and friendly people The perfect combo for a great vacation!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Good swimming beach. Bring your own chairs and shade if you can. Otherwise you can rent chairs. We went in April when locals can camp on the beach so it was a bit crowded.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,I love the beach and this beach is beautiful! It's a busy beach but there is plenty of room for all! Love this beach!!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,The sand on this beach is the finest I have experienced. The beach is clean due to waves coming in from two directions. The very shallow entry into the ocean make it just plain fun and relaxing.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Great place to go and swim - preferred Palm Beach and the Highrise area as there were more places to visit drink eat etc.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Very clean and quiet beautiful waters and very calm no waves. we stayed at Amsterdam so we always had chairs and shelter.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,This beach is "OK" - I would suggest enjoying it and then renting a car to visit Baby beach. Baby beach is relaxing shallow and just gorgeous. I'm so happy we went.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,The water is warm the beach is clean and the sand is soft. What more could you ask for. It was not over crowded.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,My husband and I weren't to thrilled with Aruba but we loved the beach! Nice and clean beach clear water powdery sand. We did jet ski here as well.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,What a lovely safe clean beach. The water is warm and the sand is very white which means it doesn't burn your feet.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,It was safe beautiful and you could walk far enough along it to get in some exercise. The water always felt great.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Excellent beach - spotlessly clean with white powdery sand and clear serene water. Stopped at Palm Beach first but too busy (big brash hotels - reminded me of Cancun). if you like quite beaches where you can snooze in peace or watch people strolling along the sandy expanses then this is the place for you.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,The eagle beach is very beautiful the white is found on all the hotel area and is very very nice the beach was so relaxing. It like a massage by nature lol
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Have visited Eagle Beach 5 times!! LOVE this beach!! It's an amazing place to vacation!! Highly recommend!!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Water was amazing. Beach was clean. But further down the beach gets a little rocky so beware! Lots of fun water activities to do!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,We spent a whole day at Eagle Beach and did nothing at all. Loved every minute of it. Rent chairs for $15 each. Layed back and people watched. This is a very long beach so long walks in the sand is a must.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,This beach is the best in Aruba. Crystal clear water white sand extremely clean. The sunsets are breath taking.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Talcum powder sand and cool calm water with Sun Breezes and no rain. A great beach. Bring lots of high spf suntan lotion and stay in the shade between11 and 1 o'clock
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,The beach is not so crowded...........the water is calm and breath taking. Its beautiful! A must see!!!!! I love it!!!!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,This is the most perfect beach I have ever been to. The water is crystal clear and the sand is white and soft. The sand is never too hot to walk on and a breeze is always blowing. Can't get better than this.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Going to the beach early in the morning under a palapa and having your morning coffee! A nice way to start the day!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,This part of Aruba's beach front is quiet. Not a lot of activity. Great for relaxing. Low rise hotel area.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Nice wide beach...nice for taking long walks in white sand and crystal clear waters... beautiful views and sunsets!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Lovely beach in front of the low rise hotels/condos. Not a lot of shade as the umbrellas are reserved for the hotel/condo residents. Get there earlier and park your chairs under a Divi Divi tree. Chair rental $15/2 chairs Water sports available but wind surfing or kite boarding is not at this beach.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Eagle Beach had what all the beaches lacked: peace less crowd and cleanliness. There was no litter or debris here. Just the white sand and the green blue water lapping up on your feet as you walk on the edge of it. The beach is picture perfect and the calmness one feels here relaxes you.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Eagle beach is the best beach on the island. Even if you are staying on another beach it is worth the time to go to eagle beach. The water is always calm and the sand is always soft and white. Even if you just go and walk the beach from one end to the other it is a great experience.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,If you want to just lay on the sand and soak up the sun or jet ski or enjoy a banana boat ride this is the beach for you. The views are truly beautiful.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,We caught the bus from Palm Beach to spend the day at Eagle Beach. It was a great decision. The waters are beautiful the sand soft and perfection. The cool breeze that drifts across the island keeps you cool. Can't wait to return.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,The beach was a white sand paradise. No crowds. Water a little Cool but just right considering the consistent high air temperatures.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Loved it! was the first beach I hit up while in Aruba. Has beautiful trees. Very quiet seems to have more locals on this beach than the others. Went Jet skiing and had an awesome time
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,This beach is beautiful but when the wind is blowing the sand will blow in your face all day. Better to go over to Palm Beach where it is a lot calmer.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Best sand I've ever seen; water like you see in the movies! Beaches are public property a certain distance in from the water but don't let this scare you. I recommend any beaches south of Bucuiti and Tara resort. Wider smoother.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Really loved the fact that it sits right across the street from La Cabana. The beach is clean they provide chairs there are tables with umbrellas get there early they go quick and it gets hot in the full sun. There is also a hut that sells drinks. No shells on this beach....at all which was weird
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Can;t say much to dislike in Aruba. A little crowded. Probably due to time of year that we visited. Fun place to take but to town and do shopping but now most of the stores have either opened up shops in this area or closed. Most shopping downtown is geared for cruises.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,This beach is one of the reasons we visit Aruba each year. White sandy beaches crystal clear ocean. It's just breathtaking. Definitely one of the best beaches in the world!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Gorgeous calm waters….beach is too crowded and also loud (random music lots of wave runner/party cruise companies on the beach etc)
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,The beach is beautiful and water is calm and blue. They keep it clean and water sports available. Nobody was selling items or nagging to buy things.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,this beach is superb! the Divi Divi trees make the sunset viewing amazing. The sand is amazing the beach is long and beautiful.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Great beach and don't forget to visit Bog -a -loos bar when you are thirsty. Very atmospheric busy and trendy
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,having been already to Europe Middle East Asia Australia and Caribbean and Cancun this is one of the very best beach I've experienced.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Be careful when walking on the beaches as they are FILLED with broken shells we had to tip toe around everything and it doesn't make walking on the beach very much fun. :-(
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,This is our first time to Aruba and we are staying on Eagle beach. It's beautiful! Lots of open air restaurants to choose from. From very casual bar food to fine dining. Love it here!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Great beach text book perfect. Just be sure to get up early (by 5am) to claim a Palapa otherwise your out in the sun without protection.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Compare to all the beaches in Aruba this one was the most quiet and wildest. We stayed next to the Divi Resort there is a beach volley pitch and we can order drinks (happy hours beginning of afternoon) and food from the hotel. Less touristic than Palm beach.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,We've been visiting this gorgeous beach for 15 years. It is my favorite place on earth! The water is spectacular and the beach is very very clean!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Eagle beach is one of the best beaches it wasn't crowded we great lounge chairs. The sand and surf were perfect no nasty rocks to climb over. Had a wonderful time there.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Eagle beach is one of the top ten etches in the world it's GEORGEOUS ! MUCH less crowded than the other beaches on the island and the location is perfection...a little bit of paradise...
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Go to eagle beach for pure white sand and beautiful water. It's right off eagle beach and the hotel strip!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Best beach on the island! Very clean and small waves. Try the food guy located by the parking lot in the white trailer. Amazing!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Awesome white sand beach - love that it was not crowded during our January stay. Water is crystal clear with beautiful color. If you go to Aruba this is a must see beach!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Easier to find Palapas - go there a little earlier (around 10-11 AM) and you can find yourself a nice quiet spot to spend the rest of the day! We didn't like a bunch of crowded Palapas like we observed on Palm beach. This is the perfect spot for a quiet vacation.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,the resort we stayed at was at the southern end of Eagle Beach and...wow...a beautiful stretch of powdery white sand! About at least 100 feet of open wide sand from our resort to the sea...so very beautiful!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Amazing beach... just beware it does get crowded. There are some good vendors and some not so good vendors on the beach.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Gorgeous beach….can't find a nicer one in the world. Clean beach; clean water; small (almost nonexistent) waves; gorgeous sunset. Loved it. Will be back.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,The only sand in the Carib. that will not burn your feet. The volcanic rock somehow doesn't say hot!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Lovely beach! Really clean you should try to swim here with some snorkel gear! Nice tropical fish! The water is really clean.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Was the best beach for views on the island. Was one of the less crowded beaches and was able to rent huts on the beach.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Great for a walk up the beach to the highrise hotels. You can then visit some of the beachside restaurants and bars and further enjoy all Aruba has to offer.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,The chairs can be rented but pricing varies depending on who you ask. Ten a chair is the most you should pay! The bar is near by so drinks are available. They have water sports there as well and parking is easy. The sand doesn't have tons of coral while getting into the water.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Eagle Beach is one of the most beautiful stretches of sand in the world. Tranquil waters and good swimming.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Pure white powder sand turquoise blue water that's warm ...you can't ask for more except bigger waves maybe...we just relaxed and floated along!!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Less crowds the sand is golden & soft. We stayed at Oceania condos across the street with secure locked gate. Some late night parting by the locals but not too crazy.we took a walk to palm beach & its not as nice & very crowed. Loved eagle beach! A short walk to any activity.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Amazing aqua colored water and beautiful beach a lot of water sports available for rent. Umbrellas are available for rent as well and there is a DE PALM tours office right there.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Great sandy beach for walking and bobbing in the warmcalm water. Watch for the dive bombing pelicans.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Beautiful beach but busier. Easy to find rental stuff para sailing jet ski etc. Chairs are for hotels across the road. Dan
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,A must see if visiting Aruba. The sands are so soft and white the ocean from the lightest turquoise to the deepest blue. This was part of an "Island Beaches and Highlights" tour taken while on a cruise. What beautiful pictures emerge!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Get there early and get a palapa so you can enjoy the sun and get out of it when you have had enough.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Less crowded than Palm with bigger beaches . My hotel was right on the beach ( Bucuti ) looked at other beaches this is the best
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Cleanclear warm turquoise water. Sand is perfect. No seaweed-very clean environment. Everyone friendly. Perfect swimming beach and great for walking.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,One of the nicest beaches we have ever been to. We heard it was rated one of the top ten in the world and I am a believer.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Aruba's original resorts started here for a reason....beach is beautiful water is stunning. The area does not encourage large noisy crowds but family friendly accommodations or adults only resorts. Loved it
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,We had some issues here getting chairs...they wanted to charge us an arm and a leg. We rented jetskis here and it was fine...but we ended up leaving very upset because of the chair situation...we paid for them but the guy was still giving us a hard time and we said forget it...and went to another beach.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Blue water and white powder sands. If you are looking for a postcard this is the place. The most famous trees of the island. are there.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,The most beautiful pristine beach I have ever seen. Calm and turquoise water --the sand stays cool because of the wind. We never wanted to leave.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,By far the best beach in Aruba. Spacious calm relaxing. If you want a beach vacation this is your spot. Save Palm Beach for shopping and dinners.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,What a long pretty beach for white sands and swimming in shallow waters. This is the crowded beach just south of Palm beach where all the resort hotels are built.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,If you want the shade you have to go to beach very early to reserve a thatched hut to cover up; otherwise just wonderful.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,One of nicest beaches we have been on. Can walk for over an hour either way in pure sand no shells or rocks. Decent waves warm clean water. Gorgeous.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Hubby and I stopped to watch the sunset at Eagle Beach the last day we were in Aruba. Awesome views and it was such a nice place. Wish we could have returned for a longer visit.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,A bit more breezy than usual - actually downright windy. Ocean clean and not too many waves. Certainly one of my favorite beaches.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,This is the perfect spot to sit and enjoy the sunrise sunset or anything in between. The pelican's dive right into the water and you can watch them for hours. The sand is soft and great for walking. Beautiful clear blue water. Plenty of water sports and excursions to take yourself for more adventure.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,A long beach yet crowded with lounges in front of highrise hotels. Felt cramped and too busy overall.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Dive or snorkel among beautiful coral reefs admire the most exotic fish or explore old shipwrecks. If you have never practiced this fascinating water sport just do it. qualified instructors teach all levels from beginners to experts.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,We stayed at the Bucuti hotel on Eagle beach - simply beautiful amazing to be able to have this beach on our doorstep to stroll along whenever we wanted!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,What an amazing beach seemingly endless white sand and blue water! Could have stayed forever. Easy public bus ride from the port. However nothing to buy when you're there so for sure take food and drinks.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,had a few hours here on a day trip to aruba and loved it also stoped at a buger van where all the local workers went and had the best meal of the holiday we had 2 drinks and a form of chicken that was grilled and so yummy with chips and rice for 12 dollars.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Gorgeous powdery white sand beautiful aqua waters very little surf. Lots of room to spread out and enjoy sun and the glimmering sea. Can't beat this beach. Fewer people than other beach areas we visited.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Perfect escape from resorts. Great water good for snorkelling and chilling. Loved it! Not so many people and easy to access.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Eagle beach was definitely the cleanest/uncrowded beach we saw in Aruba. There was plenty of room for whatever activity you were looking for.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,The water is so clear! The shopping is fun! The area is area is clean!! We walked every where and felt completely safe and carefree! The area is great!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Very nice beach that is less crowded than Palm Beach. Easy to get to by cab or bus and still has the amazing waters and beach.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,This is by far the best beach in Aruba cleaner less crowded clear and blue. We have been to beaches in Nassau St. Thomas St. Martin and Mexico.. This is the winner... Must GO!!!!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,The beach goes on forever. Safe clean white sand blue waters. The best way to relax--- buy yourself a raft and stretch out with lots of suntan lotion.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,The resort I stayed at is located right across eagle beach. Eagle beach's soft sand and great clear blue water is deserving of its top 25 selection. Beach is very safe and family friendly.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,The serenity calmness white sand long walks. It was paradise. This was such a beautiful place to visit which we have done several times that we know we'll go back there again.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,This is a very busy beach for a lot of folks who winter in Aruba. Very social atmosphere with a bar and food available. It's also the home of the very photographed Divi Divi tree.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Eagle beach is one of the best beaches in Aruba. White send Blue still water not rocks and derbies like other beaches around the island.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Great Jet Skiing place in the Aruba. Very clear waters. Great time. my kids talk about jet skiing there the whole year.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Lovely stretch of white sandy beach with no rocks when walking into water. The color of the water was spectacular.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,I liked the size of the beach. For the ones that like waves (or a bit of them) it is the perfect place. I prefer the beaches that look like a pool hence I preferred Palm Beach. It was not crowded and we enjoyed our path through!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Eagle Beach is a very nice beach. Uncrowded clean and nice white sand. The only problem are the jet skis too close to the swimmers.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Possible shade under tiki huts chairs lounges and cabanas available liked it all friendly atmosphere and congenial folks on beach
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Beautiful clear water no crowds no seaweed or grass in the water no need for water shoes...... Fabulous!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Beautiful beach with wonderful white sand always uncrowded. For us it is the best place in Aruba where you can relaxed and enjoy the beach.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,The low raise (Eagle Beach) is not as busy as the (High Rise Area) Palm Beach. eagle Beach is a great swimming area.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,The sand is nice and the wind keeps the day very comfortable - be careful though - the wind makes you think the sun is not burning you - but it is - always wear sun screen and then enjoy enjoy this wonderful place.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,The beach was huge plenty of room & not over crowded. It was bigger than most of the beaches next to other resort on the island.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Eagle beach is a lot less crowded than its neighbor Palm Beach and the sand is really soft and like sugar. Waves can be pretty rough for little kids but its a great beach.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,the beach near Holiday Inn was in excellent condition. There was ample room to walk sunbathe and walk to other venues. The sand was soft and nearly white.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,If you are willing to 'rough it' without the amenities of high-rise hotels this beach is worth it. It is beautiful unspoiled sun sand and breeze without the huge crowds you find at Palm beach etc. Public washrooms are available at a resort across the road and a food cart operates with tasty local fare and (non-alcoholic) drinks.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,soft sand and calm clear water make it ideal for true relaxation. great combination of activities like tubing parasailing etc.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,The view was breathtaking. The beach was not overcrowded and there were plenty of chairs available. Water activities were available.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,not too crowded just perfect and no one nags you to buy stuff every minute. We stayed at a resort there and never felt the need to go to another beach.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,a fine beach free with thatched huts to sit under not far from the water close to parking bathrooms and food. Endangered by looming new construction that will imminently add to competition for space. Unfortunately the beach itself is filthy with cigarette butts and discarded debris. The people who use it have no respect for it.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,White pristine sand and turquoise blue waters...perfection! Very clean and was only bothered the once by a beach vendoe selling necklaces....most resorts control this well with security cameras on the beach front
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Eagle Beach is by far the best beach I have ever traveled to. White sand and clear blue water. I miss it every day!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Love this beach! Amazing white sand with green blue water. Just perfect. In March Eagle beach is home to mama turtles that you can find nesting right along the shore. The locals stand vigil over the nest of eggs until they hatch and if you are lucky you will get to see the babies take their first swim!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,low crowds no fight for a spot- plenty of places to grab something to eat or drink across the street
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,A beautiful paradise! Clean and not at all crowded in December. We stayed at Manchebo beach resort and spa fabulous!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Sunset was amazing every night. White sand is some of the best in the Caribbean. Snorkeling not good here
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Great beach fantastic sand and fairly wide at places so you don't feel crowded. Not many people in December.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Awesome!! sand water absolutely fantastic. In my opinion the most beautiful in Aruba. After the beach you can go to Pinchos Bar near Eagle Beach perfect for a drink at sunset.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Love love love the beautiful beach and water! The sunsets and white sand. Not crowded and walk from room onto beach ... doesn't get any better!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Eagle is a pretty fairly wide clean beach with some nearby street parking some resort and private chair rentals with a handful of cabana umbrellas if you get there very early.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Uncrowded pristine gentle waves stunning view. We had dinner at Paradise on the beach with a fabulous sunset.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Beautiful beach!! Beach is away from the hi-rise hotels and from downtown so quieter then other beaches.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Soft sand you can get out of the sun if you need to. Very clean beach. I love to walk the beach a few times a day. There's enough beach to easily do this!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Beautiful and quiet. Away from the crowds of the high-rise beaches. Easy to get a palapa for the day. Pretty white sand.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Eagle beach is a perfect location if you prefer a more quiet environment to stay but also near to the busier entertainment centres (Oranjestad and Palm Beach).
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,One of the larger beaches. Many palapas for shade. Chaise lounges available. Cafe right on beach and restrooms nearby.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,My favorite part to swim here is between the Divi Phoenix and the RIU Resort. Right where the little tower is. Great sunset too! I love my home.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Wide open beach with beautiful water. With constant trade winds that keep the temps pleasant this beach is hard to beat. It's very easy to sit back with a frozen cocktail and unplug from the world
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,We stayed on Eagle Beach for Thanksgiving week 2015 and enjoyed it very much. It's a beautiful well-kept white sandy beach that will be fondly remembered. We were at the Riu Antillas.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Eagle beach is very pretty lots of beach to walk for a while and lots of activities to do and the most famous trees on the island are at this beach. Worth the trip to find them for that special picture!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,We tend to hang out at the Divi Golf end of Eagle Beach. Never crowded. Plenty of space between your beach chair and the next person. I hesitate to say too much nice as otherwise too many folk will start showing up!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Eagle Beach is well located near and in front of a lot of hotels in Aruba. It has very calm waters but maybe crowd in some periods of the day. This is the beach where you can find the Famous Divi-Divi twisted trees to take a beautiful photo!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,

g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Busy - great sand. Best if you are staying at a local hotel because the seating is watched closely for the benefit of their guests.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,All the beaches in Aruba are beautiful we didnt stay long at Eagle Beach because the waves were very rough! All the other beaches have very calm water
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,The beach is busy with people and activity both in the water and on the beach. Readersswimmers water enthusiasts walkers and just plain beach bums are all welcome and present. Plenty of chairs lounges palapas are available.

g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Beautiful beach which was very wide and expansive and you can walk for miles! It's breezy but most of Aruba is! The sand is very soft and powdery and the water is a beautiful turquoise blue. Easy to just relax here!

g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Eagle Beach as not crowded. It is the most beautiful beach I have ever seen. I did not see any rocks as another reviewer mentioned. The beach is very long so the rocks must be only be in a certain section. Our beach was smooth the water was as good as it gets.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,A great beach to walk and the service at Passions Bar excellent. Thanks Ronillo ! Could have done without the Seadoos(jetskis) though
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,We loved Eagle Beach. The sand was soft and didn't burn your feet. The water was just cool enough to be refreshing after lying on the beach for a while. We had no trouble getting a chair in the sun or shade when we wanted it. The sunsets were great!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Away from the high rise hotels this beach is frequented more by locals on the weekends and not over wrought with people. Water is perfect and sand is pristine. Great late night stroll area!

g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Soft clean white sand leading to the clear calm turquoise sea. You can walk for miles from Eagle beach through to Palm beach.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,The water is perfection ! Quiet respectable people enjoying the surroundings. Great people watching beach and covered cabanas are free and necessary to not over due the suns rays.. Bring your own drinks from the market across the two streets. as they charge a huge fee for the same at the bar.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Stayed at Bucuti on Eagle Beach last week (Oct 12-19 2013). The whole experience was amazing. Beautiful clean white sandy beach with calm clear water.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Eagle Beach is such a beautiful beach! The sand is soft and it's easy on the feet to walk right into the water. The water is pretty calm so you can hang out in the water all day long! The sun sets are amazing!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Much better shopping than downtown. A lot of nightlife. There are two malls. The one to the north has a light show at night.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,There is nothing to dislike about this beach it is amazing ! The water is calm and it's a wide beach and it's not crowded.

g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Clean white sand clear blue ocean and uncrowded. The water was warm and the sunsets were picturesque.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,For me it was the best beach in Aruba. Close to Hotels and vacation rentals not so crowded as Palm Beach due to there are not so many hotels along.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,I have never seen a more beautiful beach miles of unobstructed white sand and blue water. Put it on your list too see it is like no other beach I have seen.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,

g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,This beach has clean sand and a killer view of the Sea. You will be enjoying the beach along with the locals.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,All the beaches in Aruba are breath taking  clean and beautiful. Clean water. Friendly people. Cold tropical drinks. Awesome food. Some of the reasons we've been to Aruba ten times!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Eagle beach is quiet clean and naturally beautiful..away from the busy hotel zone with man made beaches. This is the nicest beach I've seen yet.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,eagle beach is beautiful the sand is like sugar the water is crystal clear bluish greenish and and perfect refreshing but very comfortable waves are fun but not over powering the sunsets are breathless the only thing I did not like about my honeymoon was that it went buy to quick!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,White sand very long and wide beach with palms sea with all tones of blue to light green. I will get an hotel on this beach next time in Aruba much better than Palm beach.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Beautiful soft sand gentle waves. Staff helped us find shade and chairs. Nice place to watch the sunset. Bar on beach with Happy Hour.

g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,water was beautiful!Walked out and had gorgeous fish swimming around you.Not rocky/pebbly.Great sunset views
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Always beautiful! The water is so crystal clear and clean. The sand is soft and very little seaweed/debris/shells.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,We stayed on Palm Beach but could walk to Eagle Beach where all the high rise hotels are. It is very windy and the sand can blow against your body as you walk along the beach. There are trees that have shrivelled up due to no rain on the island.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,The swim beach at Eagle Beach is huge. The waves are not huge so very nice to swim and play! The sand is so white make sure you wear your sunglasses even while in the water!!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Cobalt blue water and tranquility. The people are friendly and relatively laid back. The surf is calm and perfect for snorkling.

g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,We decided to go to Eagle Beach instead of some of the more touristy beaches to avoid the crowds and we made the right decision! It was relatively empty. Gorgeous beach not to be missed if you are in Aruba!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,My wife and I loved how spacious and quite Eagle Beach was. Especially when we had a chance to see how crowded and noisy Palm Beach was. If you are looking for a mini-Vegas stay at Palm Beach. If you are looking for sand water and calm stay at Eagle Beach.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Be sure to visit around June as the new baby turtles will hatch and crawl to the ocean. The best beach because there are no crowds and it is clean.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Beach had nice soft sand and the water was so blue and clear. We keep thinking we were in a swimming pool. The view and sky are just beautiful!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Beautiful beach comfortable thatch roof covered chairs plentiful water sport activities (snorkeling jet skis parasailing) bar service and great food at beach restaurant. What more do you need? You won't be disappointed.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,ranked very high..soft sand soft waves fun to feed the fishes with breas--yes they swarm you..t is so much fun!....the sand is maintained and clean...
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,White sand like powder under your feet. Occasionally a pelican flying in for a bite to eat. Fabulous aqua water so clearbuoyant and warm I never wanted to get out. Sunshine almost always beautiful sunsets.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Eagle Beach is the best beach in Aruba. Its white sand beautiful view and amazingly blue water are simply the best!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Clean sand gorgeous warm beautiful fish filled water available loungers little thatch covered shade areas- what more could anyone want? Drinks are even available.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,We love this beach. It is clean and beautiful. I would recommend the Bucuti end of the beach if you like quiet the other end near Amsterdam Manor has motor sports for rent on site and tour buses drop off large groups of people that tend to be rowdy. The Bucuti end does have some partial nudity on occasion though.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Nothing to dislike. Long stretch of beach. Not crowded at Costa Linda. Can walk to other restaurants.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Most beautiful water I've been in--and I've been there and done that! Tiki huts are available as well as chaise lounges.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,The beach is very large uncrowded with beautiful water and white sand. Great for long walks. There is very little eave action so the water is like being is a giant pool.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Beach seem to stretch for miles. Wide and white sand with the beautiful water. All water sports available but do not interfere with sun bathers. Hotel is polite across the street in allowing use of bathroom facilities.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Sparkling blue water and white sand makes a perfect place to spend the week! One of the best beaches on the island.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Amazing! The water is so clear. The prices were high for 30 mins of jet skiing ($65) but everything else was perfect. This beautiful strand of easy surf and powdery sand were directly across the street from our room at Paradise Beach Villas.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Eagle beach is the most beautiful beach I have ever visited. The sand is white the palms are everywhere and there was a lovely breeze the entire time we were there. Don't miss it.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,I think this beach suits everyone's taste. If you like to have some action you can rent a waverider and if you want to snorkel and relax you can do so too! Downside are the cigarette buds that people just put in the beach. The sand is not an ashtray people!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Snowy white soft sand crystal clear waterpeople from all over the world. Free parking and bring your own cooler. This is paradise
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,probably my favorite beach in Aruba. white sand blue water and not too crowded. great beach to take a stroll. there's a bar on the beach a restaurant and shopping right across the street. there are little huts and lounge chairs you can rent for the day. super relaxing time!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,My favorite beach in the world so far!! The water and sand is beautiful. I can see my toes in the water and little fish swimming around. Once you go in you don't want to come out. It is very relaxing and peaceful.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Jet skis & boats muck up the clarity of the water - walk a few blocks North or South and you'll enjoy clear water.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Eagle Beach is so beautiful and is a very relaxing location to spend our days in Aruba. The water is so calm that floating on a raft or even just your back is lots of fun.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Beautiful clean beach with plenty of amenities. This beach is shared by several resorts so it is a bit crowded.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Pristine beach ... No hotels on it ! Can see why Sports Illustrated used it for shooting so many of their "swimsuit" issues.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Not crowded and sand and water were great. The traffic was light and you were still near the tourist sites as well as the local sites.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Lovely strip of beach along the hotel strip - well populated but great for a long walk. Several beachside restaurants are right on the beach as well as varied water activities.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,this beach was one (if not THEE) most beautiful beach I've ever been to. I have traveled all throughout the carribean and this place stands out. Its a great beach to relax or bring the kids to. There is snorkeling jet ski rentals street food. Cant wait to visit again.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,The beach was beautiful. the water is clear and clean. not as busy as Palm beach down the road just a little ways.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Beautiful plenty of hotels but less crowded than Palm Beach. This is the low rise hotel area. There are many restaurants most of them at the hotels and resorts but you can make a reservations and eat there. A good place to stay too as the beach is calm and less crowded.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,I had a fun day in the sun to relax. The water had no visible weed and not as corally. The west side of the beach is way more busier than the east side. It's s very nice long beach to walk run people watch. A mix of locals and tourist. Worth spending a day here.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Beautifull beach with white powdery sand and clear turquoise sea. Touches Palm beach that is also very beautifull.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,This a bit crowded beach bc of all the hotels in the area so expect lot s of tourist. Nevertheless this is a nice beach and we enjoyed our afternoon.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Excellent beach. Found beautiful sea shells and got a wonderful tan. The sand was white and the waters extremely blue and very clean. Lots of people but everyone had good manners. Family friendly and fun & sun to be had for everyone. Yes we will go back & tell others. Aruba has beautiful beaches and friendly people.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Phenomenal area beach was clean with amazing white sand could not wait to wade out to far without a drop off. Great place for swimming.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Liked Eagle beach because it was less crowded beautiful soft sand absolutely larger then other beaches and good view seeing the cruise ships dock
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Liked to walk from Divi resorts to LeCabana on white sand. Have beach vendors like jet skis and parasail they don't come to bother you.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Everybody was saying Eagle beach is beautiful nice etc. etc. On my point of view - nothing special: sand is white water is blue jet sky renters are not very friendly and helpful scenery are not to die for average soso
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,This beach is must less crowded then the high rise Palm beach. If you want a chance at a chair on the beach - I'd suggest Eagle beach!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Clean soft and never scotching hot. Maybe due to it being crushed coral rather than sand. Wonderful way to spend some time on the beach
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,The beach was phenomenal. There was always a nice breeze to keep you cool. The water was comfortable and clean. It had such a calming effect on all of us.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,perfect frontage clean no seaweed clear close to everything yet plenty of room to run .play & walk
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,This is a beautiful beach and while staying at Manchebo we did not feel crowded. From the sugar white sand to the crystal blue water to the perfect sunsets - you can't go wrong!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Its public and there were allot of activities going on. Safety and quite Sunny. Quite good public service and attendance.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Hands down one of the most beautiful beaches in the world! I cant wait to visit again! I also recommend BABY BEACH on the east coast of Aruba also. That is my favorite spot
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,I live in Florida and have been to many beaches! This by far is better than any beach I have ever visited! The waster is absolutely amazing! Crystal clear sandy bottom. The white sand doesn't get hot. The beach is not really over crowded! I loved it! Couldn't ask for a more beautiful relaxing beach!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,My favorite place in the world. I have returned here 5 times off and on since 2001 and still every time I go somewhere else and return I wonder why I just do not come back to Aruba every Year
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Fabulous beach a walk along the shore line is amazing the exercise happens without your brain even knowing it. Bonus.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Beautiful long clean beach with picturesque opportunities by the native Divi Divi tree. Did not swim here though looked sandy similar to others nearby. Close to Oranjestad and the high rise district but much quieter as is associated to the low rise district and more frequent return visitors looking for a more relaxed atmosphere.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,This is one of the most beautiful beaches I have ever seen. It was uncrowded and relaxing. The ocean was so inviting with it's clarity & warmth & small waves. Pelicans dive for their dinner for entertainment. I just can't begin to express how gorgeous this beach is!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Had the pleasure of vacationing here last year. Amazing time and an amazing beach. It was worth every penny and we will be returning in two weeks. The turquoise waters are amazing and the beach is immaculate. Countdown!!!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,I went to jet ski and it was based in Eagle beach. The sand here I felt was softer than Palm beach and a lot less traffic.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,No noise or crowds. You can walk down the beach and rent jet skis if you want an expensive thrill. The water is a blue that words cannot describe.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,This was a very nice beach with soft sands and very clear water. The only bad part is that its very touristie. If you want something more local try another beach. The plus is that they do have bathrooms shower and restaurant.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,You will not feel like your stuck in a can of sardines like in the hotels hotels. Clean and quiet waters gorgeous sunset!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Beautiful clean beach that we walked to from high rise hotel area.cleaner beach than Palm Beach and less crowded
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Serene quiet and beautiful. Best beach area in Aruba! The beach bar could use a little music to liven things up during the day.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,On Eagle Beach you can just relax with a quiet beach setting or you can walk a short distance and participate in beach volleyball or any type or water activities
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,It is the best and less populated beach in Aruba. It allows you to take long walks along the shore while enjoying a beautiful view of aquamarine colored waters in which you feel like drowning all of your worries. Free umbrellas provided by the local government.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Wonderful beach with stunning views. Lovely for swimming with clear water and not crowded at all ... In July.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Not terribly crowded and a big wide beach like you'd find on the US Atlantic shore. Easy access from the low rise hotels and some parking along the road.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,The clean soft white sand felt like an indulgent treat and the water was so calm we spent most of our days sunning and swimming.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Find a dry day without clouds for some beautiful pictures. If you are lucky there are some sea turtles who lay their eggs overthere and it will be interesting to watch the young turtles find their way to the sea..
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Not crowded sugar-white sand and calm surf. Simply heavenly beach... We stayed across the street in a condo/residence building and spent nearly every day there. I've been to Maui St. Barth the Bahamas... This beach beats every beach I've been to hands-down!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,The sand is incredibly soft and the water is a beautiful blue. Eagle beach is by far the most beautiful beach I have been to.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Incredible view! Perfect white sand! The view from Eagle beach is much better than other spots on the island. Eagle beach is quiet and pretty much kid-free!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Eagle beach is just stunning! Nicest stretch of beach in Aruba! The water is turquoise blue and the sand is so white.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,The beach was HUGE and very clean. The water was crystal clear warm and calm. Waiters on the beach would be a good idea- saw them once during our eight night stay. Music on the beach would also be great.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,clean beaches friendly shop keepers love the juice bars they make some refreshing drinks. Beach was clean hard to find shade most of the huts were reserved for hotel guest and had to line up by 3 pm each day to reserve them for the next day.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Great for relaxing..Not too many children...Rent chairs...get a hut and your in paradise...Can see many couples of all ages enjoying this beach.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Safe clean peaceful. You can walk to the other beaches but why. We did walk up and down the beach saw baby turtle tracks but missed the big event. Clean water and soft sand. Birds everywhere and no not a place to snorkel but everything else was wonderful.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Crystal clear beautiful sandy beaches lovely surroundings easy access to hotels restaurants and downtown.

g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Great place to cath some sun. Water was warm with suttle waves. Best Pina Colada in the happy hour time.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,This beach is just excellent. Everything you could want is located on this stretch of sand. Cocktails people watching jet skis great swimming divi divi trees. I like the fact that all the beaches in Aruba are public.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Nice time on eagle beach the best beach by far on aruba! had a good time on my vacation to arubawill definitely tell all my friends about aruba
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,quiet beach away from the 'louder' tourist areas. Most people here just want to relax and enjoy the ocean
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Very lovely area gorgeous sunsets lots if restaurants facing beach with views of shore treats sunset. Simply lovely. Very calming and relaxing
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Eagle beach is the most beautiful AND tranquil beach I have ever been to! It is too pretty for words so make sure you bring a camera and take lots of pictures! It is also unbelievably quiet in comparison to ANY beach I have been to in the Northeast. Definitely a must see while you visit Aruba!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Stayed at amsterdam manor on eagle beach this beach is probably best on island t was quiet and there were no rocks in water like the other beaches
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,

g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Just a huge beach and does not feel touristy at all. We walked there from palm beach just to see what's it like. We like to party so we stayed at the busy palm beach side
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Beautiful white beach great for long walks and clear blue calm ocean. No dangerous rocks or sea weed.

g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Within minutes of our hotel room. Clean quiet beach with pristine waters and soft white sand. Access to water sports but not intrusive. Less crowded version of Palm Beach.

g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,great sandy beach with a lot of shaded areas nice facility for drinks or food. bathroom needs a lot of improvement is a port-a-let
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Eagle beach is very large. It's wide enough to accommodate lots of people but the smaller hotels keep the number of beach goers at a more reasonable level. We walked the beach in the mornings you can walk for nearly 2 miles. It was beautiful.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,The beach was Clean and spacious water was beautiful and warm sand soft and white. Did not have any trash or debris lying around. Plenty of beach chairs and umbrellas
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Pristine white beaches gorgeous crystal clear water turquoise and blue beauty as far as the eye can see.

g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Wide white sand. Gentle breeze. Blue waters. Lots of restaurants and shopping to choose from along the beach.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,blue water white sands not too crowded. unless you stay in low rise hotels you need car or taking bus to go there.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,the water is so calm and amazingly blue. you'll need a hut because the sun is fierce. best beach ive ever set foot on.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,This is a wonderful Beach. Sands are beautiful water is amazing. I do however like getting out of the crowds and found other beaches with less people. If you could remove the people this may be the best beach on the island.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,The island is very beautiful. Very breezy but a very welcome breeze. The taxi's and the bus system was very reasonable. Many great places to eat some reasonable and some very pricey no different than at home. My husband and myself loved it and would love to go back.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,we had a great time at Eagle Beach. The sand was amazing and the water was cool and crisp. It was not overly quiet and people were respectful of others. Great place to spend a day - or several days.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,The most beautiful beach ever! The sand was so smooth it was like a lotion. There was so much to do and places to eat! I would recommend to anyone!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,I am not a great swimmer and I like the fact that I can go pretty far into the ocean and still be able to stand.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,I am just amazed a place like this exists! The crystal clear blue waters and beautiful sand. Eagle beach will forever be in my heart. It also is not super crowded which is nice to just sit back and enjoy without tons of people all over you. Love it.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,I loved everything about Eagle beach!!! the water was crystal clear and the sand was like powder! the only thing I wish they didn't have is the Jet Ski rentals!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Gorgeous clear clean beach. It wasnt crowded and it was truly paradise. There were no hagglers bothering you to purchase items.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Clean calm can get a bit loud depending on the crowd that is out there then and how much happy hour from ABC and Casa del mar they have enjoyed
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Eagle Beach has beautiful sugar white sand extremely clean quiet and relaxing. It is a wonderful place to catch a sunset under a lovely Divi Divi tree. Calm ocean waves makes this a favorite of mine!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Eagle Beach was so pretty the water was turquoise and at dusk it changed to a really pretty light blue.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,We stood at LaCabana which is on Eagle beach. we got great service from the cabana boys to the happy hour watier. Great swimming but no snorkeling
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,There wasn't a thing I didn't like about and especially meeting my good friend Averil. We have been coming to the Phoenix Beach Resort for 16 years and Aruba before the time share for 4 years and never even consider going anywhere else.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,This beach is incredible. White Sand and Aqua Blue water. Large Beach that can accomendate lots of people. We have a timeshare on this beach for over 20 years. Would not want to go anywhere else.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Awesome beach. Get's crowded later in the day so come early and drink a lot. :) Then head back for a daily nap before going big.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Just beautiful plan to rent a chair. Spend the day enjoy the sun. Very long beach so plenty of room.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Excellent beach. Can't wait to return...Sand was powder white water clear as glass. Plenty of water sports in the area. Resort is near by and access is easy.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Beach was easy to access from hotel clean and plenty of places to stop for bite to eat and drink. It was not too crowded and the water was beautiful
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Stayed at the Radisson Resort which is right on the the beach. The sand stays COOL and the water is green/blue. A fabulous experience.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Amazing white beach with much less people if you compare to the the high rise areas. All you ever wanted for your Caribbean vacation and more. Enjoy! Mrs K
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Wide beach not rocky or crowded. Lots to do but not too much. Beautiful sunset. It is also close to great restaurants and casinos.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,The snorkeling in Aruba was not great but the beaches were awesome. It was not bad. Better than Puerto Vallarta Michigan and North Carolina but not as good as Hawaii or Grand Cayman. Yes I have snorkeled a muddy lake in North Carolina. Eagle beach is better.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Clear Blue water white clean pure sand and more than enough breathing room made eagle beach the perfect spot for relaxation and fun!
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,There are no words for Eagle Beach. White powdery sand no sea weed nice breeze and nice people. The Gulf Coast and the Atlantic Ocean will not cut it anymore for your vacation once you have been on Eagle Beach.
g147249,d150447,February 8 2016,Miles of wide beach for your chillaxing enjoyment. Go for a walk and check out the sea turtle nesting areas. Rent a jet ski and cruise the entire length of the beach. Or just lay out and work on your tan. No hustle and bustle here.
g147249,d150447,March 7 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 7 2016,Great beach; great water temperature. The current can be strong so be careful. Also you have to get to the beach early to reserve your "hut" and chairs. It's a very popular spot for all the right reasons. Aruba's Tradewinds don't blow sand in your face or anywhere! Heavenly place to hang!
g147249,d150447,March 6 2016,The quality of this beach is EXCELLENT. Not in love with the island but I would go back just for the sand!
g147249,d150447,March 6 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 6 2016,We were able to snorkel in front of our hotel on this beach. The water is so clear and the snorkeling is done in water you can touch in which is nice. The sand is white. You will love this beach.
g147249,d150447,March 6 2016,Best Beach ever. Can walk for miles and I spend a lot of time in the ocean. Wonderful experience . No one trying to sell you anything or braid your hair. Peace of mind and freedom to enjoy your holiday.
g147249,d150447,March 5 2016,Loved the temperature of the water and it was calm enough so we could all go into the ocean being we have some that are not good swimmers. The sandy bottom was spectacular.
g147249,d150447,March 5 2016,Beautiful white sand and miles of coastline to walk or run without feeling like you are intruding on anyone and the color of the crystal clear water? WOW!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,After a nice lunch at a near ny restaurant we went to the beach and sat down for 10 minutes. A guy came amd said he jad to put away the chairs at 430pm amd that it costs 10 USD for the chair. What beach closes at 430pm??? What about sunsets???
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Located on a beautiful beach very good accommodations Also a large variety of restaurants in many price ranges.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,We were right on Eagle most of the time less crowded and still have everything you would want. One of the best beaches in Aruba.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,The beaches were clean - no trash/debris! There was a hut to rent chairs. Taxis were easily accessible.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Eagle Beach is SO beautiful. The water is crystal clear and the sand is soft. The water is generally like bath water and easy to swim in!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Our resort the Bucuti and Tara resort was located on this beach. It is much wider than at other resorts and the sand is so white.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Amazing 3rd year in a row at Eagle Beach! The staff on the beach is very helpful in finding a hut to use for the day and getting us food and drinks. They are so kind. The sand feels great and the water refreshing. Can't wait to go back next year!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Went to Eagle Beach to jet ski and hang out. Really beautiful water and white sand. We must have been lucky as it was not busy at all when we visited. I would suggest that beach goers plan ahead - there were limited amenities (food / bathrooms) in the section we were in.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,I had been to aruba 30 years ago and remembered a quaint quiet Island. If you love noise and crowds this is your spot. If you want to wind down consider somewhere else.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Being as it's right in front of our place (La Cabana) it's very handy. Very clean and nicely kept. The snorkeling in Aruba is the best!!!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Beautiful beach and white sand. Weather was great. We would suggest others to visit this beach and check it out for themselves
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Beach is well maintained. Water was warm and inviting. No complaints about trip to Eagle Beach. Take time to visit it.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Stayed at Costa Linda resort right on the beach. Much better than Palm beach much less crowded and no "honky tonk" . Water calm and crystal clear sand white and perfect. Would rate it as one of the best  if not the best we have visited.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,We stay across the road at La Cabana. We are at Eagle Beach every day. It is the best beach on the island! We love it there! I am already missing my time there!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Even if this beach is close to the low rise as the beach is large there is plenty of room and the white sand is great.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,The water was incredibly clear and turquoise. The water was the perfect temperature to offset the heat of the day. Although it was windy it was so enjoyable and relaxing. The white sandy beach was very large and spacious.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Didn't go in the water to far but it was one of the most beautiful beaches I have ever seen! A little crowded though!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,This one of the most beautiful beaches in the world. Don't miss it if you make a trip to Aruba. Better yet plan a trip to Aruba just to see it.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Nice beach to swim or relax. Next to the hotel area but not as crowded as Palm Beach. Only take care with the chairs: they belong to the hotel and they charge $15 each. Too expensive in my opinion. Just take your beach towel with you find a nice shadow under a Divi-divi (local tree) and enjoy the place.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Eagle Beach is a top ten Caribbean Beach for a reason. The water is crystal clear the sand is white and creamy smooth. My wife and I have yet to find this little slice of paradise crowded. This IS the place....
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,We went to dinner at Passions on the beach across from the Amsterdam Manor hotel. The beach was so beautiful and the sand was incredible. Loved it.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,White sand and warm waters tranquil and peaceful Beach is very clean and safe. Alot to do as far as water sports sunbathing bars food and much much more
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Nice public beach inbetween city center and big chain hotels area. Almost wild beach without own infrastructure but small restaurants in close neighbourhood. Fantastic for sunsets fantastic for long walkings. Silent place with small hotels on the other side of the street. Clean sand and clean emerald water...
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Absolutely amazing in every way.....the white sand blue ocean all the activities and restaurants. Couldn't have asked for more!!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Eagle beach is quiter softer cleaner and way less crowded. Better to stay here and make a trip up to palm beach one day to enjoy the bars.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Love love love this beach! 3miles of white soft sand! What more could you want-don't miss this beach
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,The aqua blue water was amazing to look at and quite refreshing to get in (i.e. a little chilly). The sand was soft and clean.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,The beaches are beautiful and clean and if you go inthe summer you might just see the baby turtles hatching.June and July The water is great and not rough
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Quiet wide soft sand and clear blue water makes this beach the best on Aruba. Don't waste time anywhere else. We checked them all out and Eagle near Manchebo is simply the best. Stay away from Palm Beach.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,We really loved staying in the Eagle Beach area. Most days it was like we had the beach all to ourselves.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,If you like quiet then this is the beach for you. A tad on the quiet side for us not that we like noise just nowhere to buy a snack or water etc.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,The beach is beautiful in Aruba. The sand can get a bit hot but it's worth it. There are some waves so i would keep an eye on children with floating devices. We loved it.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,definitely one of THE most gorgeous beaches I've ever been to. Any picture you've ever seen of Aruba is true to form. The white sands are SO soft and the water warm clear and shallow for miles.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Great location on the island. Pristine white beach with plenty to do! Highrises run along this part of the island giving plenty of dining and options. Multiple piers for excursions and snorkeling trips. Snorkeling or diving the antilla shipwreck is a must do!!!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,The beach was great with plenty of room for everyone to spread out and relax. Met some very nice people from the Netherlands. The waves a very tiny easy for anyone to get in and out of the water. Pure relaxation!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Absolutely one of the best beaches we have been to. Sugar fine white sand wide beach great to walk. And not crowded
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,This is the best beach on Aruba. The sand is white and clean. The coral is off of the beach making it great for kids and swimming.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Such a great location. Beautiful beaches and we had a great time! We cannot wait to return! Aruba has the best weather and the beaches were clean and beautiful.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,If you're looking for an awesome beach in Aruba this is one of the best. Long stretch of white sand beach perfect for swimming sunbathing or just walking forever. Great place to watch the sun set. Spectacular.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Almost deserted clear water clean sand. Only one or two palm trees so take lots of sun block. Very peaceful experience by the sea.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,The beach was clean and the water sparkling aqua just lovely to sit and read except when the wind was blowing strong. The Trade Winds do keep the temperature at bay but not the sand unfortunately that was the only downside having sand blown all over me.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,We all go to Aruba for the beautiful beaches and water and Eagle Beach is the best beach front in all of Aruba. Walk out of your hotel or if you are renting a beach home walk or drive to this area- it is worth it. All of the hotels have great restaurants and are steps from the water.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Nice beach charged too much for chairs take the public bus to the beach. The sand was nice the ocean bottom was uneven but soft. Water was refreshing.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Beautiful clean beach. Blue clear water wonderful waves and great walking beach. Not crowded any time white sand
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,This public beach area is between the high-rise and low-rise hotels. There are palapas and chairs available and the water is just beautiful.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Soft long stretch of sand great for a day or night stroll. Several outdoor dining options available on or overlooking the beach.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,We're here just after high season and the beaches are not crowded. We have our choice of any umbrella shade we want. Prices for lounge rentals vary so check the different spots for reasonable rental. One day the water was calm and the next day there were 3' waves. There are restaurants nearby at the low rise resorts.

g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Eagle beach was nice. The waves are low and perfect for water sports and jumping off the small pier in the sea. The water is cool here but the raging sun keeps you warm at all times.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Eagle beach is by far the best beach in the Caribbean! The water is crystal clear and the white sands are amazing. You can walk for miles on the beach!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,I like the beach. However I did not like the location. Very quiet. Not much to do. If you stay there you will need a car or spend a lot of $$$ with taxi.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Best Beach in Aruba! Perfect white sand and turquoise water. Also there were no vendors bothering us the whole week. It was peaceful.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Not too crowded and excellent sand and water. We never ran into an issue with getting a chair or a spot to sit. If you want water sports or activities you'll want to go to the crowded areas but if you want to chill this is the place.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Beautiful beach! Not crowded. Get there early to reserve chairs in shade. Gentle sand slope into ocean. Able to stroll along beach to the south a long way. Many stretches of open beach.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,we flew frm Sngapore to visit one of our favorite beaches. still as gorgeous as ever! 23 trips to Aruba in the 25 years of our marriage and it is just one of the best!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,nice beach to lounge huts (palapas) are free you have to rent loungs chairs ($10 per chair) or bring your own. Do not drink the beach-side shower water. Was told by the locals to not drink it. Showering is ok but don't drink the water from it.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Perfect powder sand. Not crowded (as we found palm beach to be). Just perfect! Parking is easy. Only down is that washrooms are hard to come by....
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,We've traveled to a few different beaches but always compare them to Eagle Beach and there IS no comparison. The white powder sand the turquoise water the rolling waves simply breathtaking. If we have a choice of spending the day at the beach or going on some excursion the beach wins EVERY time!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,We only loved it we didn't really dislike anything. We got ants sometime in the condo but not a problem.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Might have been windier than usual but I felt like I was in the Sahara in the middle of a dust storm. Plus a little on the dirty side as were most of the beaches we went to on Aruba.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,White sands crystal clear (but cold) water and breathtaking views is one of the cleanest and most beautiful beaches you can visit in Aruba.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,The beach is amazing! You can walk from Eagle Beach about 2.5 miles on the sand down to the end of DiviDutch Village...It is not crowded like Palm Beach! Well kept up with many beach chairs and umbrellas. Sand is very fine and not rocky! Swimming is great! Nice breezes while we were there...
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,This beach is perfect! Passions on the Beach has great service Juan and Napoleon are the BEST! It is a peaceful beach and still with so much to do! Best spot in the Island.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Finer sand which is better for walking on the beach. Good swimming with gentle waves. Borders the Low Rise section of independent hotels and timeshares.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,perfect weather in Aruba as always great beach beautiful sunsets warm water and a few small good bars at night they set up Passions restaurant which is outstanding
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Wonderful beach with fine white sand and great swimming. Since this is not by the high rise hotels the beach is quiet and peaceful. There are some thatch hut like cover areas on beach to get out of the sun if needed.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,The beach was absolutely beautiful clean fine sand turquoise blue water and an amazing sunset that look like the sun just dropped into the water.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Not crowded and doesn't have the dirty mucky water like at the high rises. Bring your own chair or rent one for $5.00 and enjoy these spacious beautiful beaches.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,fantastic - clear water and white sand what more could you want? Picturesque location - must visit - also quiet and not overcrowded
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,What a welcome relief to get away from the crowds noise and motorized water sports of Palm Beach! Eagle Beach is but a 20 minute walk south of Palm Beach. Beautiful wide expansive soft sandy beach. Not a secluded beach...but quiet scenic convenient and relaxed.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Great relaxing beach white sand and clear water. Is a small island so everything is close. Get a tan and relax or cross the street to get a cocktail If you are a beach bunny you have to see Eagle Beach.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,we love aruba and eagle beach is one of the best beaches in aruba we stay at tropicana and that is the beach that we use along with the LaCabana guests it is clean several hut umbrellas that is necessary if you are going to stay the day on the beach
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,We stayed at the Amsterdam Manor right across the street. Beach was clean and much less crowded than others on the island. Not a lot of water activities but you are just mins from Palm Beach which has all the activities...and all the bodies as well.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,The beach was picture perfect. White sand aqua blue water and lots of huts to sit under and cool off.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,I'd prefer this beach for water motor sports because it is a little less crowded than the Palm beach area. There aren't as many shops around this beach though so keep that in mind.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Loved this beach and went there often. Not very commercial but you can go to a couple of small bars for a drink. Never busy and the sands and waters are excellent. Best beach i have ever been to.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,This beach is wonderful to go to with plenty of activities available if you choose to partake in them or it's also pleasant to just sit at. Most hotels/resorts have their own section of the beach that they set up beach chairs and covered areas around but all beaches are public so feel free to roam if you want to.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Great beach with very little wave action making it easy to get in and out of the water. Lots of visitors but never seemed too crowded.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Great beach perfect for relaxation and sports. quiet compared to Palm beach. Water is crystal clear and great for finding little treasures. Loved it here.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Worth going to visit! Luckily for us our condo was ON the beach and we got to play on it daily!! Loved this beach - WHITE SOFT sand and shades of blue water!!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Eagle beach is where the older low rise resorts are so it is much less crowded. The sand is soft and warm and inviting. You can walk for a long way just enjoying the beauty. It took me about 50min to walk it each way. Skip Palm beach altogether.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Eagle beach is the most beautiful beach. The water is stunning. The color breath taking. The sand is like white silk. You can walk for miles. It isn't very crowded. Just put down your chair and enjoy
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,This beach has the softest sand and the widest beach. TIP go to the further left side less people and better setting
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,This area is so beautiful and even if you're not staying in a hotel close by you need to take a cab or the bus and come visit it. You won't be disappointed it is picture perfect. I would also suggest booking a hotel near it.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,This is a beautiful beach a must each time we have been and we will return when we travel to Aruba next month. It is in a nice area and always a fun time.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,This beach has to be walked on to be appreciated. The sand is white and the water calm clean and beautiful. The sand is a composite of coral and due to that it never gets hot. This beach was rated in the top five in the Caribbean!!!!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Both Palm and Eagle beaches are probably amount the best beaches in the world. I prefer Eagle Beach because it seems to have less blowing sand and less water sports. You can't go wrong in Aruba though.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,We loved Eagle beach pristine water sand and landscape! It can get busy but try to go to the corners if you like a little privacy. Lots of parking spaces and easy access. I recommend!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Eagle beach is just down the way from my favorite Palm Beach. You can't go wrong at either. I felt like the wind was stronger here but that's not a fact. We will be back for sure.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Eagle beach in Aruba is one of the best beaches for swimming and walking. All the beaches in Aruba are public so you can walk for a long time. (Just be careful of the sun!) The water is relatively calm most of the time. The color (different shades of blue green and turquoise) is mesmerizing!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,such a beautiful picturesq beach. Not crowded like Palm Beach at the high rise hotels. Water is crystal clear - waves are amazing.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,This is the most beautiful beach in Aruba. White sand wide beach area not too crowded clear water. Amazing. Preferred over the crowds at Palm Beach. Not as "touristy". Need to pack your own food as there are no options to purchase food or drinks on/near this beach.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,super clear water white sand cabanas diva trees no seaweed no shells jus beautiful sand and clear water.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,It was beautiful And all the people in the area were wonderful. The water is the color of what you dream on the beach. And you can clearly see through it and see fish swimming around you. That's some experience for a New Yorker that used to black water at the beach
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Eagle beach is one of my favorite locations for doing family and couple photo shooting as a professional photographer. Eagle beach gives me many ways to make memories not PICTURES of families and couples during one hour. I do them like there is no camera in front of them and the result are nice candid expontanius and unforgettable moments.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Love the beach - fine sand colorful water everything... dislike the fact that some part of it in front of some hotels is crowded
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Long beach with coral sand. Sometimes high waves. It is forbidden to sell goods on the beach (positive).
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,A very nice beach to go windsurfing with very nice sights some waves and not too warm water. Definitely very nice spot to go sunbathing.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Clean white sand beach turquoise water - this is what the Eagle beach is. From what we have seen at Aruba (and we drove around) this is the best one on the island.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,I think it's the best beach on the island: With more sand than people and beautiful sunsets it is paradise.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Great beach for walking swimming or just enjoying!! We would spend the time in front of the Amsterdam and rent their chairs! They have a great bar and lunch was delicious!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,What a wonderful beach just gorgeous colour of water and beautiful white powdery sand. Many wonderful places to eat and lots of night action.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,A beautiful white sand beach. Sun and surf. What more can you ask? Convenient to the hotel and clean. Watersports vendors on the beach but not pushy or intrusive.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Widest beach sand and gorgeous tourqoise water-breezy Red flags most days while there. Water temp perfect for the hot days in the sun.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,large beach with white sand very quiet and less crowded than Palm Beach which didn't look very nice in comparison
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,You can stroll the beach far as far as you want as there are no "private" beach sections. The sand is soft and does not get too hot in the sun. It is windy on this island.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Great sands crystal blue waters friendly people with a good mix of locals and tourists not expensive.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Beautiful white sand; amazing clear turquoise water. Not real busy. Windy most of the time but did not get in the way of fun; it kept things a bit cooler.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Loved eagle beach. Very beautiful beach. Fairly quiet compared to the high rise area. Very low key lots of retired people.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Eagle beach was close to our resort it was clean and not too crowded. There was a constant wind that made the hottest day comfortable.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Unfortunately when we were here the sea was too rough to swim in but the colours were just gorgeous. The beach is lined with trees so good natural shade. A good beach to look out for colourful birds and lizards amongst the trees.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,A week on Eagle Beach was just beautiful...From sunset to sundown just a wonderful breeze fill day of sun and beautiful blue water....Love Aruba....4th trip with sisters.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,We were staying at La Cabana so this beach was right there. Most convenient. Make sure you take suntan lotion or you will fry. The temperature is deceiving since the wind is always blowing and makes you feel cool. Nice cabanas to park under.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Eagle beach is just the best. All the resorts that skirt the beach are great. You can walk and stop and have a drink walk and watch the sun set. It is safe to walk for hours after sunset.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,I loved everything about eagle beach. The sun pristine sand and oh the water was dreamy. Warm and inviting. The color of the water was one of a kind. I never dreamed I would sit at a beach and look out onto the ocean and see so many different shades of blue. I spent many hours relaxing in the sun.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,It's a nice beach. But crowded. Sand is nice and plenty of shade. It was my second favorite of all the beaches. But it's hard to beat Manchebo beach. You don't have to stay at the hotel to enjoy it. They keep Eagle Beach clean and groomed. And it's a great place to catch the sunsets.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Very nice beach for relaxation. Nice exercise to walk on the beach 20 minutes to northwest or 30 minutes to southeast. Is blowing often with high waves against the shore. Good to swim once you come out a few meters from the beach. Nice to study the pelicans that dive for fish
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Best beach on the island lots of room and great sea bathing although the sea can be a bit rough at times
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,They kept it pretty clean but it was extremely crowded. You pretty much had to walk through the lower lobby of the Westin to get there.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,A gorgeous beach to enjoy all day!The sand was sugar like & the water fantastic! The only thing I found crazy was that people get up at 5:00am to get a hut!!! Love to go back next year and enjoy this island again!It is in fact one happy island!!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Simply stunning beach much quite than palm Beach. Some smaller resorts with great happy hours while watching the sunset. Matthews is a nice little restaurant for bfast lunch or dinner.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,It is what you want in a Caribbean beach. It's wide with a gentle slope into the water. The water gets deep gradually. Most of the resorts have lots of chairs and coverings.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,just a beautiful beach; we enjoyed a short visit here; it was clean and well kept; as in most areas in aruba we weren't hawked by someone selling something all the time; the temp every where is a constant 82 degrees day and night and the water is quite cool but easily adjusted to.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,the only thing is becasue the winds and waves are strong its not like cuba where you can see the bottom. The sand is in constant motion so it looks murkey
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,If you need a palapa to pull into the shade it's ludicrous that people are up as early as 4:30 am to stake out their spot.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Seems like the quieter of the two main beaches in Aruba would def think of doing this area the next time around. Perhaps the Bucuti beach hotel. Beach is white and powdery and although it looked a little rocky in the ocean in parts there were plenty of areas to swim rock-free.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,This is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful beaches I have ever seen. We visited this beach at least 4 out of the 7 days we spend in Aruba and found it to be quite relaxing and not crowded at all.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,I spend a whole in Both Palm and Eagle beach.I have nothing bad to saythe water was cleanwarm and calm beautiful hotels .Is Just Wow!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,We love this beach white soft sand not overly busy where we go and the water is so nice also the people that are there are great as well.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,

g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,An absolute must for every Aruba traveller. White sand and turquoise water. This beach is ideal for families and children. Better than Baby Beach.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Forget the congestion and touristy Palm Beach. Eagle beach is the way to go as it is far more private wide and the water is cleaner and more blue.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,The beach at our hotel was great. Very clean. Ocean was a little rough for me but not for my husband or other people. Very relaxing and quiet.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,It is wonderful to be able to walk for miles and miles on this stretch of marvelous beach. We prefer this area to the high-rise beach area because it is so low key and not inundated with water sport hawkers.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,The beach was beautiful. The sand feels amazing. The sun is hot but if you get up early at your hotel you can get a palapa to shade yourself. You can rent jetskis banana boats etc. on the beach. Also in the afternoon at La Cabana they start delivering buy one get one free drinks in the sand.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,The best beach in Aruba. I especially like the no kids policy at the Bucuti. The beach is quiet and not too crowded.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Quiet clean and not over run with watercraft/jet skis. This area is considered the low rise hotel area which is my favorite area.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,This beach is wide and clean. Glorious white sand. It's across the street from several hotels and easily accessible to the people staying there. We were staying a little distance away so we drove and easily found a place to park. There is a roped off area to keep swimmers in and boaters out. No lifeguards that I noticed.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Forget Palm Beach Eagle beach is the place to stay! Super wide each and not crowded incredibly soft sand.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Very calm waters not crowded and very romantic. The only bad thing is the wind blows constantly so sitting on the beach is not a great idea unless you like getting pelted by sand. Otherwise the water was the place to be.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Eagle Beach is wonderful. Soft white sand. Turquoise water. A great place to chill away from it all.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,This beach has a divvi divvi tree growing in the middle of it which makes for a perfect back drop when taking pictures this tree only grows in Aruba looks like something out of a Harry Potter film the way the trunk twists and turns.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,At the eagle beach you can see one the the main postcard of the island the threes that had a special format due to the wind
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,The best beach in Aruba and lots of elbow room. Be aware that my wife was not a fan of the winds in Aruba but I found it refreshing with the heat so if you have a spouse that does not like their hair wind blown than prepare for this. Lol.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,It was cleaner less crowded had silk like sand and bluer water than Palm Beach. Only downside is that there are no hotels directly on the beach. All the hotels/resorts are across the street.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Just perfect for relaxing and swimming. Though if your not at the hotel you will pay around $15 to stay.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Just got back from Aruba our hotel was across the street from Eagle Beach- beautiful sand not crowded at all very minimal waves. Would be fine for families. Lots of water activities if you want that but can just chill out and enjoy the sunalso. Loved it!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,beautiful beach nice resorts there. great sand. decent shelling in the morning. can get crowded. pretty light blue water.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Beautiful long white sand beach with plenty of cabanas and beach loungers. The ocean is nice and sandy bottom on this beach
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Beautiful quiet beach. Escaped Palm Beach for less crowds and people yapping. Able to rent lounge chairs near a bar.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,I love eagle beach it is right across from we're we stay it is always clean very safe and the small huts/ tables are perfect if you would like to get out of the sun for a bit the only thing is is that you have to get there early to get one.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Need I say more just make sure your close to the Amsterdam Manor beach bar and you'll never be without refreshments!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,This beach is always clean and peaceful. It would be nice if we didn't have to run all the way back to the hotel to use a restroom but its really not that inconvenient.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Used to stay here 20 years ago. and nothing changed really. well maintained and great breakfast! Good deal (value/money) beach in front is visit by locals since it has free parking. this all build to the atmosphere.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,We stayed at the Divi AI and every morning (and often in the late afternoon) we took a stroll along Eagle Beach. It has beautiful sand and is not as crowded or noisy as Palm Beach. we had some amazing sunsets on our evening walks
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,We Won We Won it truly is the "BEST BEACH" visit for yourself I do every year at the LaCabana. Everything is there food drinks huts and bathrooms. The water and sun sand is the 9th Wonder of the World. Yeah Eagle Beach Aruba congrats......
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Nothing can be compare with... clean and white sand and cool caribbean breeze ... while zipping a nice coco based fruity cocktail...
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Really beautiful and clean beach! It was located just next to our hotel and used it every day. It was not too crowded and it was nice that we had our chairs and beach towels from the hotel.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,What is not to like. The beach is superb. You have to be a guest to sit on this part of the beach. You are few short steps away from pool bathroom bar drinks your room.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Beautiful - long white sandy beach seems to go on an on.. peaceful and a nice getaway from the busy beaches on the hotel strip!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,I couldn't ask for a better beach anywhere. The water the sand and the weather is what makes Aruba the perfect vacation spot. My favourite by far.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,white sand which doesnt burn your feet blue waters like a pool you can walk for hours and still not get bored a must visit
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,A real paradise beach. Blue sea beautiful white sand and the clear warm sea make it the perfect beach
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,You can walk for miles...You need to see it to believe it...beautiful turquoise sea and soft white sand.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,A huge and beautiful beach with several cabanas and chairs! An excellent place to watch the sun set. Water is warm and aqua blue!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,This beach was located directly accross from the MVC hotel. It is clean. close to transportation and was never crowded. There is easy access a short way down the beach to parasailing jet skis and other water attractions.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,One of the top beaches in the world! Even on Christmas day not overcrowded. Go for lunch to the MVC Eagle Beach and be pleasantly surprised
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Great beach! Clean white sand with clear blue water. Took the Arubus from the pier for less than $2 per person. Ate at a hotel across the street.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Beach has towels chairs and drinks available. Wasn't too crowded. The water was clear and beautiful.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,After having gone to many beaches in the Caribbean I was a little disappointed. It' s an okay beach but I have seen a lot better beaches in Bermuda and especially Barbados by far. No lifeguard present.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Lovely beach to take a walk along the shore. Very clean white sand a bit more waves than hi rise area.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,The Eagle Beach is well worth a visit. The beach is beautiful and water is clean. It can be a bit windy.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,So much better than Palm Beach. We found some shade parked the car nearby and drove back to the shopping center casino when we needed anything to drink or a break from the heat.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,We spent an afternoon at Eagle Beach and were not disappointed! It is such a beautiful beach with gentle waves and plenty of shade. We even enjoyed lunch at a local beach bar.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,This beach was the prettiest largest and had fun for everyone! Only thing it doesn't have is snorkeling so you need to go to Arashi or Baby beach for that.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Beach was beautiful sand and water were amazing. Unfortunately due to all the jet skis and boats you are unable to really enjoy going out in the water without the fear of dying.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,when i die i want half my ashes sprinkled on eagle beach been there 25 times and it gets better every time! the best beach in aruba if not the world!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,This is a great white sandy beach that may well be the best beach in ARUBA. Its only drawbacks are 1. it occasionally gets a bit crowded with all the people it draws from and 2. it often serves asa camping grounds of sorts for locals during their holidays. Nonetheless it is a very nice beach.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,The sand is powdery and really white the water is clean. There are two nice trees in front of amsterdam manor beach.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Eagle Beach was amazing! From the powdery sand to the light surf I can see why this is one of the top-rated beaches in the world! I instantly fell in love and am already planning my next trip to Aruba!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,I liked Eagle beach much more than Palm beach. This place is much more quiet and clean. The beach is beautiful. Great for swimming. You can rent a beach chair if you want to for 5 dollars. There are lots of parking spaces. There are also many restaurants and bars nearby. You must go there.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,The water was calm crystal clear blue waters! It was not crowded like Palm beach. The sand was soft golden color. We loved everything about it! It was the best beach in Aruba!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,A beautiful beach that has many things to offer including bars and dining on the beach. Can be crowded during the days in front of hotels. Plenty of water activities offered.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Rated one of the top world's beaches by all the travel magazines for a reason. Sugar sand light surf plenty of shady spots. Drinks and snacks available on the beach. Makes for a very nice day.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,we have always loved Eagle Beach and think it is great. The beach is very clean. We did note that that the beach appears subjected to errosion over the years and storms. You have to get a spot early especially during high season at the resort we were at ie Costa Linda.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Divi trees on Eagle beach towards Palm beach .. we found parking right by the trees. This is the smaller low rise area .. and the beach seemed just as gorgeous as down the road at Palm beach area. love the prospective of the divi trees right on the beach.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,The area just south of the Divi Phoenix is particularly nice as it's away from the crowds. However for swimming you need to go directly in front of the hotel where the seaweed and rocks have been cleared. Beautiful warm and relaxing.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Clean not over crowded beautiful water first come first serve with the huts but always a place to go or sit
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,This beach is in the low rise area. It is very nice. If you are staying at a hotel without a beach go there. There are chairs and palapas. It is a really nice beach!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Best beach on the island we went to others! Looks exaclty like the photos! absolutley beautiful! The sand is super soft! never hot! The water is lukewarm at best but you adjust very clear you can see fish schools around you feet! a little seaweed but thats ok!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,This beach is the nicest beach I have ever been to. The water is calm and clear. The beach is great for walking and sunbathing on.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Everything was great at this beach. The water was clear lot of huts to sit under and enjoy the day.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Beautiful white sand beach. Quiet with plenty of room. Cabanas available for all. Superb for swimming not so good for snorkeling
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,This beach is so incredibly beautiful. The sand is amazing. The consistency is great. It doesn't get hot so you can walk on it barefoot. The water is so clear. Great for snorkeling. One of the best beaches I have ever been to.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,this long stretch of beach is splendid with white soft sand and clear water... also lined with palm and divi plants
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,The sand is powdery white and squeaks it's so clean. It's within walking distance from the high rise hotels. The beach is wider than some and drifts off into the ocean at a smaller degree than others.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,This must be one of the world's nicest beaches. The sand was glistening white not too hot not rocky and the water was a beautiful aquamarine every day with calm waves. I loved the twisty trees and walking along the beach at sunset was really romantic and peaceful. Beach wasn't too crowded in November!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Didn't like the vibe on the beach...lots of seaweed people trying to sell you boat rides murky water etc.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,One of the best beaches we have been on. We stayed at the Lacabana. Only downer is lost my new wedding band while swimming. Looked all week but it is swimming with the fishes.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Awesome colored water. Beautiful sunsets. Wonderful swimming.There is nothing bad to say about the beaches
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,this beach was loated across the street from my hotel. we were so lucky to visit this beach everyday and night for sun sets. just have to get there early for a cabana and chairs
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Have to visit if you travel to Aruba! The Divi trees are amazing to look at! A great photo op. the beach is also so pretty if you can make it past the beautiful Divi trees. :)
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,We liked this beach. The water rolled us a couple of times so we tended to stay out of it when the surf was up but it was much nicer than Palm Beach.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,I have visited beaches around the world and Eagle Beach can hold its own with most of them. Beautiful water and sand. Great sunsets. Try it you'll love it.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Liked white sand no crowds beautiful swimming water. Palapa's all over. Is one of the nicest in all of the Caribbean.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,The soft white sand is so fine it does not heat up during the day. You have an expansive beach with great views of pelicans gannets and terns. The Bucuti beach is quiet (no DJs) and they will bring you drinks to your cabanas.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,No one was selling me things the water was clean and the sunset was spectacular we could walk for miles and the sand was soft. Sometimes there were good waves sometimes it was very calm. Perfect beach
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,I haven't been everywhere in the world but I have been to several places in Mexico Africa (east coast) and the Mediterranean and I have never walked in such immaculate sand as on Eagle Beach. I cannot say enough about how great the sand was!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Perhaps the second best beach area following Palm Beach. This beach area is kept clean for the most part especially where hotels/timeshares have a tourist stake.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,No crowds lovely beach wide and spacious. Powder white sand and green seas are like bath water ... amazing!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,i liked the resort the employees was very friendly food was great beach was beautifull everything was great cant wait to go back
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Eagle Beach is long great for walking and wide. Beautiful white sand. Typically windy so gentle waves to float in. Beachside resorts welcome guests even if you are not staying there. Be sure to watch the monthly Beach Tennis Tournaments.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,lovely beach wide and clean. We go often and normally there is allways a palappa available. Parking normally no problem but little spots in the shade
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Fabulous beach - clean and easy access from our condo resort. Visiting Aruba during the low season is a must. The beach is not crowded and Oranjestad is open nightly for dining and shopping. A quick bus ride from Eagle Beach to the downtown or high rise area.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Beautiful white sandy beach. Rough surf but worth the work. We did a lot of walking on the beach and enjoyed the sights. The hotel grounds were beautiful and the people friendly. Not overcrowded like the high rise beaches.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,This is a great beach with white sand and clear water. Best part is the "lack" of the crowds that are at the "high-rise" areas. Great views. Nice and quit. Highly recommend.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,The beach is gorgeous - sand is soft and the water is warm and gentle - great for a relaxing day in the sun.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,nice beach. nice beach nice beach nice beach. nice beach. nice beach nice beach nice beach. nice beach. nice beach nice beach nice beach. nice beach. nice beach nice beach nice beach.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Eagle beach was gorgeous clear pristine water and white sandy beach. We stayed down on this beach the first couple of nights and were so glad we did.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Eagle Beach is not at all crowded with wide stretches of white sand and breath-taking views - especially the sunsets
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Eagle beach has the Divi trees signature of Aruba with soft white sand. Beautiful view. Took my wedding pictures there.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Beautiful white sand never too crowed. Good place to read a book or lounge in the clear blue sea. Away from the crowds of Aruba
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Very wide white beach not as crowded. Great restaurant value mathews. had breakfastlunchhappy hour and dinner right by the beach. Great for sunsets !
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,The beach was never overly crowded you could always get a drink from the bar simply stick up the flag that you are given and someone will be over to serve you a drink. their was nothing to dislike about this beach
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,The best place in Aruba to walk on the beach with loved ones and stop for a bite to eat have a cocktail or purchase water sports!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Beautiful beach south of the high rise hotels and across from the low rise hotels and condominiums to the south of the high rises. Minimal surf and plenty of palapas for sitting under. Plentiful parking. Only downside is that it can be rowdy with locals at night on the weekends.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,A must see beach in Aruba. Large beach and always great swiming and relaxation. The color of the water is incredible and the best sunsets ever to watch every night.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,A local favorite there a food truck on the beach that serves Iguana soup for those who like to try something new.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,We stayed at the Bucati and Tara beach resort. Adults only no kids and a great hotel. I'm a little bummed because although the water is warm and turquoise it was very cloudy with little visibility no reef and not good for snorkeling. The beach itself though is beautiful and very clean. Not crowded at all.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,To my mind it is one of the nicest beaches in the world. White sand is especially impressive. I swam there a bit I liked the beach so much that I would come back one day even if I am living about 20 hours of flight away from Aruba.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Enjoyed the view. Everything is so beautiful and clean. The service is excellant and very helpful. We will come back again.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Sand is great and water is amazing! It is calmer and less crowded than Palm Beach. If you get the opportunity definitely go spend the day!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Water is clean and have fish!! yes big fishes incredible. Get a bus and go to the eagle beach!! I thing this is the second beautiful beach
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,One of my favorite beaches beautiful views clean not so crowded and safe to swim. Only with stormy weather you better take care of a strong current especially for kids.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Eagle Beach is probably one of the finest beaches in Aruba. Smooth sand warm water palm leaf covers this beach has it all. And just a few steps down the beach you can probably find a bar that will provide any tropical drink you can imagine.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,i love AUA for the beauty of the beach the culture of the people....the natives were so kind and helpful.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Eagle Beach is very close to The Divi Phoenix and we spent the day just enjoying the sun and relaxing under. It's worth spending a day there.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,The water is gorgeous here and the sand very clean. Beware that most taxis will refuse to take passengers that are wet. Most display signs that say that wet or damp passengers will be denied transit so take a change of clothes!!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,It has come as no surprise to me that this beach is rated amongst the top 3 in the world. The very best spot on Aruba. This is a must visit so much better than the beaches in the high rise area.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Easy to arrive by bus from Downtown with posibility to rent some chairs. A lot of wind. And never crowded
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,This is a great beach....white sand calm water quiet beach..... only a few resorts on this beach and they are spread out... this is truly a great beach.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,My wife and I stayed at the Amsterdam Manor right across from Eagle Beach. The beach is quiet and you can always get a palapa! Forget the high rise area and Palm Beach Eagle Beach is the best beach on Aruba in my opinion.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,This is in the low rise section and you can't be the quiet and serenity you will find here. The area is just right for romance!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,We used a company set up on the beach across the Amsterdam Manor. Very friendly. Overall a great experience.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,The beach was accessible to the public. You could just take a bus or walk down from the hotel strip. No one bothered us for anything. It felt completely safe. Families couples younger singles but not crowded either.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Excellent clean sandy beach plenty of room to sit on sunbed with parasol - fairly quiet. Sea clean clear and cool
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,We liked ust about everything! Took an early walk on the beach every morning that we were there. Clean beautiful and serene. It's awesome!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Very nice beach for walking. At 4pm every day you can go to the towel hut and reserve a palapia for the next day at no charge!!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,We loved the wide stretchy beach by Manchebo Beach very quiet tidy and intimate resort if you are looking to have a relaxing time this is the prefect place (if we went back we would pick the same hotel). Can not think of anything negative about this Aruba holiday really! We highly recommend it.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Crystal clear waters white sand not crowded just beautiful! For a non-swimmer the water gets deep quickly. There are a few rocks on the ocean floor but the water is so clear you can nagivate easily. It was the best!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Lots of people but also lots to do worth going for. A few hours many restaurants around a bit too crowded compared to some of the other beaches.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Fabulous swimming water sports and sunsets! The beautiful turquoise water white sand and sun make for a perfect day with friends and family or that special someone.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,the beach is typical of the area.There is however a steep drop just off shore so beware as you enter the water
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Our favorite beach in Aruba! It doesn't get better than this! The beach is not crowded and some beach huts are available. Some parking is available if you're not within walking distance.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Great wide long beach with perfect sand. Clean safe and calm waters. If you like long walks on the beach this is for you!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Quiet and beautiful. Lots of choices in Aruba for whatever type of beach experience you desire. We read and napped under a palm palapa on lounge chairs but there were jet ski rentals and parasailing available five minutes away if desired.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,More water sportyou can rent water runner(or jet ski)all kind water sport you likeor hired someone take you to ocean for fishing trip(very early morning)
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,We lived walking along the beach from Costa Linda to the hi-rise hotels. We stude under the divi trees and watched the surfers.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,This was the most beautiful beach i have ever seen. The sand so white and the sea a beautiful torquoise blue it was heaven! No wonder it was voted second in the world in 2011
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Very clean and well maintained. Numerous food hotel shops and casinos. Don't expect much right off the beach for snorkeling - it's all sand and grass. Go north or to Baby Beach.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,The beach was picture perfect. We spent all day every day on it and it was well worth it. There's no way anyone can be disappointed. Soft sand NO seaweed on the beach no rocks to hurt your feet some big fish swimming through now and then but just perfect.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Soft white sand clear blue water no shells no seaweed relaxing waves...what else can I say...Perfect beach!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Walks along the beach were amazing as a family each night ... we really enjoyed the sand and sun during the day as well ...
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,First time in Aruba off of a cruise ship. Took a taxi to Eagle beach - all flat rates clearly displayed at the taxi stand a very good system. Calm waters great weather beautiful sandy beach. One of the best beaches we've been to in the Caribbean and would love to be back.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Visited this beach on the way back form an organized trip. Beach was clean beautiful clear blue water and white sand. Just how you'd imagine paradise would be. I had been here 26 years before and had raved about it fortunately it hadn't changed much only postive changes more around it now like hotels and bars
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Eagle beach is my favorite beach in Aruba! It is less crowded than Palm Beach and less rocky than Malmok!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Visited in early January ! The sans is so white that even your sunglasses are not enough to protect your eyes! It's beautiful !!! Will go again
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,A must when in Aruba. Minimal wind on this side of the island and all the amenities you require are near by. Great place for a beach day or two.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Just the grestest and water is beautiful.....Prepare yourself for beauty. The breeze hot sun and clean spotless beach is the best.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Stayed at Casa Del mar area of Eagle Beach; Nice waves soft sand very little broken/crushed shells when you enter the ocean; beach was very clean and had lots of people around but it was not crowded
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,We walked along Eagle beach several times and it gave us a perfect view of the sunset. Occasionally because there are no hotels that actually back out onto the beach there were chunks of sea vegetation which made the beach seem really dirty. Otherwise it's still a great beach to walk along.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Everything was great very secure and clean. People was kind really know the respect for tourist! No walking vendors on beach was pretty good.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Liked: beautiful Dislike: you have to rent chair if you are not staying in the hotels around the area
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Great beach clear water with very gentle waves. Magnificent sunsets! Chickee huts offer shade from the HOT Aruba sun and comfy beach chairs make this a great spot. Not Good for snorkling or surfing.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,One of the best beaches we have ever been to. Period. Floury white sand and water the same color as the sky. Pure nirvana.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,The water is very gentle here and the beach was a great place to soak up the sun. We spent a few evenings here waiting for the sunset and got spectacular pictures.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Our resort was located on this beach and we loved it. Nice and clean with white sand and blue waters. Love that you are not in the middle of the high-rise area.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Quiet beach off the main hotel chains just 100m from the Amsterdam Manor hotel. Highly recommended! The beach bar has happy hour that one should not miss ;-)
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,As far as beaches I would recommend staying at your resorts beach. Not enough variation to venture. Also a lack of restaurants and bars compared to the resort areas.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,White sand crystal clear water a trade wind that makes you forget the sun is dripping all over you then eagle beach is where you want to play.In may the turtles come in off the sea and if your lucky you could see the little turlelets run to the ocean late at night . this is an unforgettable beach.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,It is a very beautiful clean and not so quiet beach. Every month there is a beach tennis tournament with lots of fun music and games also a regata and during the week the beach is quiet and peacefull.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Soft white sand turquoise sea and sunsets beyond belief. This is one of the least crowded beaches that I have ever visited globally. Perfect!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Beautiful white sandy beach with gentle waves and crystal clear blue water. You can walk for miles along this beach.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Stayed at the LaCabana & the beach is across the street. Water was clean no rocks plenty of cabana's.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,We spent a day here it's beautiful & a lot quieter than palm beach. We got a spot with an umbrella at the edge of the sea and we didn't need to arrive to early either. Lovely beach hut selling food & drinks reasonabley priced. Between 2-4 they had happy hour on daquaris & piña coladas!!! Yummy!!!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Calm waters White soft sand. The cleanest beach ever. The beautiful turquoise water. I can't wait to go back to Eagle Beach in Aruba.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Beautiful sand calm waters a wonderful place to watch the sunset. For hotel guests you can lay under a palapa (which they are in the process of refurbushing) and get a drink from the Oasis Beach Bar-can life get better than this?
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,The water was like glass the sand fine and clean - so relaxing! We will definitely be back to enjoy the natural beauty of this beach.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Very nice beach I would go again and tell people to go. Snorkeling was good too. Take bread crumbs the fish love it.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,A must see. A great place to jet ski! Great white sand!! Book your jet ski with Delphi and they shuttle you back and forth from Palm beach.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Visited this beach on our third day in Aruba. It is so nice has everything you want food activities..except the large mass of people that Palm beach has. It wasn't my favorite beach but it is better than Palm.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,THE famous wedding trees can be found on Eagle Beach furthermore you have the famous "Passions" Restaurant great white sand very clean beach and if you walk in the direction of the high rise hotels you will find lots of animal life on the beach/coast crabs shells pelicans needle fishes frigate birds
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Beautiful soft white sand clear warm water and safe. Chairs can be rented for $5.00 and the guys will even bring to the palm umbrellas. This is my favourite beach so far.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Crystal clear water wide uncrowded beach beautiful white sand clean best beach on island. A must visit.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,The tree you see in all the postcards is at this beach! There are some amazing sunsets to be seen here as well!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,I appreciated to take many pictures of divi divi tree. This beach is calmer than Palm Beach and has a large extension of sand.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,right in front of the low rise section it had white sand and clear warm water it did have big waves in most spots which was a concern for some with little kids
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Cleanest calmest water. We visited other beaches like Baby beach and although snorkeling was great there eagle beach was the best for relaxation.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,a long beautiful beach with soft white sand and a beautiful sea which for a few days was fouled by some aghe. Admission is free but there are no facilities such as bathrooms or showers.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Have made two visits here both times when on a Caribbean cruise. Beauty of this beach is its proximity to the cruise terminal.Wide cleanwhite sand beach with turquoise water and very safe for swimming. Plenty of space.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,This is a nice beach. Get there early if you want some shade and a beach chair small hut to buy drinks. there are water sports to do snorkelling is not that good.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,very calm...water beautiful w/o seaweed!!! quitet no kids! took abt 30m to get there but it was worth it...also the shower to wash off wasn't working hopefully that'll be fixed soon. the restaurant on the beach had good food too!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Eagle Beach offers lots of laying area. The largest beach in Aruba. The sunsets on the beach are wonderful too!!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Beautiful beach well spaced and very well maintained. They clean the seaweed daily and the water is absolutely stunning. It doesn't even move except for when the tropical storm passed just to our north. Bring bug spray for the mornings before 8 and after dark they come out big time. In 2 hours I got nearly 100 bites.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,lovely beach..nice and quite..white water...cristal clear. Easy to access..just take the bus no need to take a cab. The Tara beachclub hotel is situated on this beach...excellent for honeymooners!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,it's right across from our timeshare we love this beach..and it has all the watersports without the lines or crowds
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,In front of the Resorts you will find many people but if you chose to walk the beach you can find complete privacy to sit and swim. You can take a nice long walk from laCabana all the way to past the Divi Resorts and still be on the beach. High Rise Beaches are crowded .
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,And with good reason- Its expansive with no high rise hotels. that means plenty of space peace and quiet. Beyond that there are few water sports and no boat docking here so pollution both Noise and gas/oil don't exist here. the water is usually pristine and there are even some gentle waves. Highly recommend this beach.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Flawless sand and turquoise water. Staying on Eagle Beach is a MUST if you visit Aruba. Bucuti resort is also a must - don't stay anywhere else (unless you are bringing children).
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,The beach was not corwded and had plenty of shade. The water was clean and clear. The beach was clean no broken glass or debris. If you wanted to go for a walk you had plenty of beach to run or jog. Even the locals come here.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Beautiful place! Can't wait to go back to Aruba!! The beaches are beautiful-just don't stay at Riu Palace-learned a lot from locals
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,We travel annually to Eagle Beach and just love it. We stay at our time share in the Tropican Resort which is getting better as the days go by. Highly reccomend checking out the availibility since it is now under GREAT ownership with a PROVEN track record!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,A GREAT beach. Beautiful water soft sand. Arrive by 10 to get a shaded spot. Jet skis can be annoying though.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Beautiful! I would stay on this beach over Palm Beach anyday. The water is so clear the beach is clean. Nice waves coming in. Not as busy as Palm Beach. Loved it.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,We used Eagle Beach right in front of the Oceania Condos. This area is so much quieter than the areas in front of the hotels down the way.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Beautiful beach! Waters were blueish/purple. Every water sport imaginable there. Wish I saw this beach sooner.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,I loved Eagle Beach! As calm as a swimming pool gorgeous blue-green water soft white sand and uncrowded. I kept wondering where all the people were. Not that I'm complaining or anything! When you imagine your perfect beach this is what you are thinking of!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Sandy and peaceful. Very windy but this is welcoming as it's hot. Sea is calm and warm and very few people.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,White sand that is cool and soft to the feet crystal clear water of quite calm seas palm trees and trade winds - it is hard to top this!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,This is Aruba's best! Always clean quieter than the Palm Beach area very wide in some areas. Beautiful sunsets and great area for photography.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,This is the most beautiful beach in the world. It is so peaceful walking along this beach early in the morning appreciating the beauty and joy of life.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,There was nothing I didn't love about this beach! From the long curvy walks to the non-stop breeze it was heaven on earth
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Beach is very clean clear water and very quiet. Would highly recommend Eagle beach to be the best in Aruba.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Now I know why Eagle Beach is rated amoung the top in the world no undertow no large waves great for small children we had the time of our lives. Not commercialized it is peacful and awe inspiring!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Stayed at the Riu we walked from Palm Beach all the way down to Eagle Beach it's great so much to see or just nice for a leisurely walk!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Beautiful beach and the water is not as riled up as it is along the High Rise beach strip. Water is clean EVERYWHERE on Aruba but this is less populated. Just watch out for sticky little weeds as you walk to the beach they are not toxic but they do hurt.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,We stayed at the MVC across the street from the beach. The beach was never over crowded and the people were respectfull of each other. Get there early to get a good chickee. Some need to be rebuilt.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,I love this beach and is just the bluest most serene beaches of all. I love how far you can go out and how deep the blue of the water is. Love Aruba.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,I've only visited in the evening as our timeshare is on Palm Beach. Lovely to walk and quite romantic with absolutely astounding sunsets. get your cameras ready.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Aruba and Eagle Beach truly an amazing place. I keep trying to find some place as outstanding as Aruba. No success. This is my favorite destination always. I have been visiting the island for years and love ever second. Once I leave can't wait to come back. The beach water climate and the people are all outstanding. Just love it.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Beautiful beach but head towards Druif Beach for less people and what i think is a better beach! skip the crowd and head to Druif Beach!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Eagle beach is calm peaceful and just wonderful! Plenty to do and see along the strip of hotels and bars.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Eagle Beach was among my favorites in Aruba. The beach is the home of the divi divi tree that you see in so many images of Aruba beaches. Also if you walk down the beach there are areas that are secluded and pristine - you feel like it's your personal beach!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Got married at Eagle Beach. The pictures are beautiful! We hired Angela Munzenhofer to take the pictures and she was wonderful to work with!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Nothing to dislike at eagle beach. Lots of hotels spill out onto this beach but everyone is out for a good time. One of the best beaches in the world along with palm beach. the sand is soft white the water is crystal clear. the whole island of aruba is just plain simply beautiful. Truly one happy island.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Very quite area  however well worth a visit even if your staying in Palm Beach. If your very lucky you may even see a few sea turtles hatching and returning to the sea. One of the best  if not the best beach we've ever been. I want to go back!!!!!!!!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,by far the prettiest water i have ever seen and with very few waves its amazing! A bit windy but I didnt notice it. you could drift on a raft forever in the water here! Also quiet if youre not around la cabana
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,By far the best beach in Aruba ! ! ! Very wide beach with turtle's nests also on all other beaches sea is quite flat on this one there is a little bit of waves so a bit more exiting.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Nothing to dislike at eagle beach. one of the best beaches in the world along with palm beach. the sand is soft white the water is crystal clear. the whole island of aruba is just plain simply beautiful.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,This beach is more quite than Palm beach and looks amazing! I would stay on palm beach for the action but take a day trip down to eagle beach! You will enjoy it...
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,White sand smooth deep beach not crowded warm easy water to play in. The down side is that jet skis and ski boats can come quite close to the shore which limits how far you can swim out.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Clean not crowded. Perfect location in front of the Amsterdam Manor Beach Resort. The beauty of staying in at the Amsterdam Manor is you don't have to fight for an umbrella they have beach towels restaurant and bar on the beach. They think of everything.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Perfect white sand beach across from the low rise hotels. Most resorts have chair rentals or free chairs depending. There are umbrellas and huts scattered across too. The water is clear and it is much less busy than north by the high rise area
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Eagle beach is far less crowded than at the other hotel beaches. It is the perfect place for a wedding!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Eagle Beach is low key and gorgeous. No problem finding a place to relax while still feeling secluded. Plenty of room to throw a ball without worring about disturbing someoneelses rest time.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Wow! One of the best beachs I have ever been one! Clean and quite. The water is just beautiful. You can't go wrong.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,the sand is so soft it feels like you're walking on powder. The ocean is so clear and clean you could see your feet as far out as you could walk. the most amazing beach we have ever been to and will for sure be going back
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,We stayed at the Divi Phoenix and when you check in the beach is sort of hidden from you and then you see it and it takes your breath away. Not like most US beaches in style; rocky at some points but you can see clear to the bottom. You can see fish crabs and all sorts of ocean life.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Beautiful beach but extremely windy. During holidays it is overcrowded with huge families that stake out most of the palapas. Nice soft sand and beautiful water. But be prepared to be sand blasted!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,We were a group from age 7 up to 60 and had a PERFECT day at Eagle beach. Girls swam had a blast on jet skis and had yummy adult drinks as well! We had a great time! We arrived late morning and the crowd wasn't overbearing. Seemed to be coming in more when we were leaving late afternoon.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Loved the Beach. My family and I had a blast. Recommend all families to visit this beach. Awesome family time.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,The beach is not as crowded as Palm beach in high-rise area. There were no waves and the sand is very soft.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,This beach is beautiful with the turquoise water and white sand!! It's pretty heavily populated but there are lots of Tiki huts for shade.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,We had the best time of our lives we met some lovely people and all the staff was very helpful we cant fault anything about it only the Americans watch football and baseball ... only joking
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,I've been to other Caribbean islands but nothing compares to the beautiful beaches of Aruba. It's pristine calm turquoise water always takes my breath away!! It's an island paradise indeed🌴🍹Crazy Beautiful!!!❤️
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,We loved this beach and we wish we would of had our wedding ceremony here as one of our planners recommended. Unfortunately we had to many guests and the venue changed. My husband and I enjoyed our afternoon walks and loved the long stroll along Aruba's coast line.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Even if you're staying on Palm Beach you should spend a day walking along Eagle Beach. It is the best!!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Beautiful sand warm clear water turtle eggs buried in sand nearby Worth a visit? The famous Divi tree on beach. Loved the location not far from Palm beach
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Liked that there was more beach than by our resort but just as beautiful. The Hotels around were we dropped off were a bit in need of help. Tropicana was just in horrible shape and not very busy would not even think about staying there.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Beautiful white sand lots of space and gorgeous blue water! It was very nice and my family had a blast.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,good strech of beach if your lucky you can see the turtles going back down to the seasome parts of the beach the sea is so clear no rocks and the water is lovely and warm
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,My husband and 2 kids spent the day at Eagle Beach after being disappointed by the beach at the Marriott Surf Club. We didn't want to leave! We rented chairs and a palapa across from the Amsterdam Manor.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Even though I loved Baby Beach enjoyed Palm Beach Eagle Beach was the most beautiful of them all. The white soft sand the multicolored crystal clear water and a quieter less crowded atmosphere made it perfect for my needs. I will return.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Wow just like the pictures! This is the best beach I have been to clean an clear just like in the pictures. If you miss this beach. your missing the best thing in Aruba
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Most beautiful beach on the island especially at sunset. Our favorite beach to visit for relaxation.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,It is Simply a beautiful beach and a little piece of heaven! Really relaxing and one of the better beaches we have visited!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,This was our "go-to" beach for sunset strolls every night...seemed crowded during the day...and we did have our favorite beach Arashi to go to..however the sand here is silky white and the water is gorgeous!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Eagle beach is so nice... The water is wonderfully turquoise the sand so very white and you can walk for long stretches. Some areas are just deserted which is wonderful. Sunsets are incredible
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,loved it went to about 6 historical sites great tour guide so woth the money would do it again and again greta highlight of our vacation
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,It was pretty crowded and the sand had quite a few rocks and shells but still very nice!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Palm beach is nice but all the resorts are on palm beach its super crowded there is no space for you eagle beach is much better and you get a whole area all to yoruself.. palapas are free for anyone the chairs however belong to the hotels so be careful
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,It was a little off the beaten path but super fun and there was a place to park... Not much shade though so be ready!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,A quiet area to enjoy the beach and the water with very few people. You can drive or take the bus or taxi. There is parking and across the road are Tulip and Mango restaurants with cool drinks and good food at reasonable prices. On the beach is Passions restaurant. Nicest part of Aruba.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Eagle Beach has more waves than Palm Beach. Other than that it also has far less people and beautiful expanses of white sand everywhere. There are little or no boat noise. It's gorgeous.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Liked everything. It's great for a relaxing afternoon. The water is very clear
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,The beach is very clean and within walking distance to most resorts in the low rise area
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,This is a beautiful sandy beach. It is very calm in most areas. This is one of the beaches in the world. I would highly recommend it.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Eagle Beach is a larger beach in the low rise hotels area. Palapas are easier to obtain without the hassle of getting up at 5am or reserving them on daily basis. Not a great deal to do in this part of Aruba so a car is a necessity.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Eagle Beach is like Palm Beach but without the casinos highrise hotels and less then half of the people.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Walked from palm beach to eagle beach worth going to get a photo of divi divi trees as in the brochures
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Water was pretty rough when we first arrived but a few days later calmed down and was crystal clear.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Eagle Beach is stunningly beautiful with clear turquoise waters and white powder sand. It's more tranquil than Palm Beach.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,This is a huge empty beach that makes you feel like you are the only ones on it!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,blue waters very white sand... serenity at it's best
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Plenty of soft white sand lots of room to catch some rays or watch a beautiful sunset!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,We stayed across the street in a VRBO condo. The beach was calm with numerous palm shelters available. This is not the place if you are looking for the "Honkey Tonk" but a great place to relax and unwind.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Most of Eagle Beach is pure white sand and no hotels. If you go down to the left there are a few hotels at the end. Nice beach to walk and go in and out of the clean water. You''ll need a beach chair because of the trade winds.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,This does not have a lot of tourists. I liked the small private settting. This place does not have any seaweed so that you don't walk on it. Other places had seaweed such as Palm Manchebo and Baby Beaches.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,This beach is not near the high rise area which made it a true getaway.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Nice calm waters. Perfect for our older child as well as our toddler. At the time of our visit you could walk out about 50 yards.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,WE visited on the fourth with the family and we had the only children in sight. The beach is very pretty and wide here but it drops off fairly quickly and is rougher than palm arashi and baby beaches. It was very quiet to the point that it felt stuffy. Perhaps best for honeymooners and retirees seeking to laze about.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Swimming was enjoyable - nice sand with few rocks. Not too many fish though so snorkeling wasn't so brilliant. Lovely!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,This is just a must for relaxing!!!! no comparison to any other beach!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Just beautiful...What can I say? The best beach in Aruba. Such a beautiful view the water is perfect temp waves are not too strong. Never felt crowded. Had a lovely time there.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Stayed on Eagle Beach at spent part of every day there. Great beach to relax drink a beer and read a book. Not alot of loud parties. . . . until it gets dark. Enjoy!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Bring your camera. A place out of this world. Sand is perfect and there is lots of room to walk the beach and enjoy the water sports.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,While this beach is not in the most popular area the high rises it is what I consider the most beautiful beach along the hotel coast. There are no jetties to break up the gorgeous white coast just sand and aquamarine sea spread out for miles. There isn't much to see for snorkeling though.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,The oceanfront at our hotel was fantastic. The sand is soft no litter the ocean is so clean and beautiful in color and tranquility. You can enjoy this with young children it doesn't drop off to deeper waters for a very far distance out.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,if you like quiet and nice clean beaches  go to Eagle Beach .... Palm beach is way to crowded with vacationers
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Beautiful beach with shallow waters and dusty sand.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,White sand and beautiful water very quiet very relaxing
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Loved these beautiful beaches with turquoise water and soft white sand!!!! The beach is quiet so there is plenty of huts to choose from on the beach!!! Love this beach compared to the rough and dangerous beaches in New York!! P.S. Bring stale bread chips or some sort of starch to feed to the fish. There are fish all over!!!!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Great beach with soft soft sand completely clean water entry with no broken shells etc. just soft sand all the way in. Gets to waist deep a few yards from shore so you don't have to walk and walk before you can swim. All around world class.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,The sand is white and the water is blue! What more could you ask for. Another beautiful beach in Aruba.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,gorgeous beach with gorgeous views! boats activities food no pushy vendors or timeshare people great relaxing and quiet!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,The beach is pristine and not overcrowded. Beautiful water. Great for watersports swimming and even snorkeling.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Perfect water sand and enough people to feel populated and not so many to feel overwhelmed.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,It was great weather and we had the beach to ourselves. Not crowded and the water was crystal clear. Nice nice nice. Loved it. Take water bottles and some snacks.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,White sand quiet (for lots of it) beautiful ocean to swim in.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,great scuba diving on this beach better to dive from boat
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,beach area very clean and didn't have to get up too early to save a spot
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,White sand warm clear water and very well maintained. It is also much less crowded than palm beach which is nice. I hope they keep it this was and not build many more High rise hotels.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Best beach in aruba wonderful soft sand not crowded
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Beautiful area for a little more privacy. Beautiful Divi trees and woodsy areas.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Eagle beach is roomy and spacious....the ability to get a seat and enjoy the sand and ocean view is GREAT
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,the low rise area is much nicer than the more crowded Palm Beach. we never had a crowd during our 7 day visit but did see the crowds and much smaller beaches at Palm Beach when we did para sailing. there is very little of this on eagle beach which we enjoyed.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,white sand blue warm water no hassle easy to park and perfectly safe.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Loved the sand here. Do not pay 10 dollars for beach chairs Amsterdam Manor charges this. You can get them for 5 dollars with guys renting jet skis. Do not pay more..
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,liked that it was was tranquill. very restful and beautiful.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Really good and beautiful beach but little infrastructure.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,I'm a beach lover. I've been to a few islands in the Caribbean and there is just something about the water here...It's gorgeous. I think it depends on the time of year that you are there but the water has been calm and easy to swim in when I've been. LOVE IT!!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Quiet clean and wonderful place to relax! If I had to retire today I'd pick Eagle Beach. It's breath takingly beautiful! God really does exist!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,A great beach area with great customer service always sunny not over crowded and the water is very comfortable.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Very empty when we went. Very windy and the sand would get thrown on you from the wind so we left. Palm beach is better.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Beach is ok but serve yourself from home don't use the beach bar from Amsterdam Manor bad service and rip off prices like everywhere in aruba special made for tourist's !!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Visit Eagle Beach for a dinner at Passions or to take pictures of the famous Divi Divi Trees. It has snorkeling and plenty of room to relax on the beach away from crowded Palm Beach.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Clear waters Turtle nests. we only went down there once not that it wasn't good it was that our beach was just as good. Shallow calm waters to start just be careful as do get deep. Clean
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,I have been to a few islands in the Carribean. Eagle Beach has out done them all
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Soft white sand gentle surf awesome blue azure water ample water sport opportunities.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,We loved Eagle Beach! It was not crowded and the beautiful white water went on forever
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,much more laid back than palm beach. we enjoyed a very relaxing lunch at passions one day.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Looking for hut each day alot of people reserve them early
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Beautiful wide beach. Calm waters that lap up quietly. Great for walking and swimming.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,white sand and clear water-no nasty seaweed to walk through. The beaches were very safek shallow water for many yards.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Beach is clean and wide water is calm and depth is gradual. lots of grass shade huts. Very fine textured sand. Breezy...like the rest of the island!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,White smoothsandy beach clear blue water calm waves. No rocks or sticks. Paradise. Forget all your troubles and just relax. I have come here every year since 1990 to enjoy this warm breezy island in Aruba.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Exactly what you would expect from a paradise beach. White sand clear water. Make sure to check out the Divi trees.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Wow one of the best beaches I've been to. It is just like the pictures.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Love the quietness of eagle beach and the lack of vendors
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Eagle Beach is swept by the gentle trade winds to keep you cool. The water is calm on most days. The white baby powder sand and the turquoise blue water make this beach a top pick.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,The best beach on the island .its big and wide .with White sand very clear water .its the best beach second is baby beach. But that place is a drive. And will be a day trip. At eagle beach all the rental s are right there .so is good and yes best of all drink .so enjoy.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,While in Aruba you must visit Aruba's most spectacular beach. What a GEM!!! Pristine turquoise waters with white sand and blue sky-truly a paradise. Enjoy :)
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,A stunning wide expanse of beach! Much less crowded than Palm Beach. My vote for most beautiful (and acessible) on the island.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Loved spending time and enjoying sunset on Eagle Beach. Would suggest driving to the south side near end of beach so you can park cars under grape trees and play some volleyball
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Pretty water average sand and the wind causes major sand blast which feels like a bunch of bullets hitting you.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,My husband and I enjoy shade bathing so we sit under a comfortable man made tree. The water is crisp and clear good for learning how to snorkel or just get up to date with friends.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,eagle beach is voted one of the top 20 beach destinations in the world now I know why. the water is just cool enough to feel great against the 85 degree temps.be prepared for a constant 25 to 28 mph wind.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,We read a lot of reviews about this beach but we're not blown away by it. The beach was nice but there was a parking lot right next to it & folks were playing very loud music in their cars. And revving up their engines. It felt like I was on a race track not a beach:(
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Clean sugar fine sand easy access lots of room. Not as busy as Palm Beach which we like. Water activities readily available. No beach venders allowed.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Eagle Beach is very white and fine. The beach was clean and always kept manacured. The beach staff were friendly and were always on hand to assist in getting beach chairs or towels.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,We spent every day all day here. Loved it. There are no waves-so great for smaller kids. The water is the prettiest shade of blue/green and clear. We found a star fish one day. If you get offended by speedos and thongs...this is not the beach for you. There are lots of them!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Awesome beach. Clean right next to Passions restaurant not too crowded compared to Palm beach.. More europeans on this side (mainly Dutch).
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,The water seemed a little more calm here and the view of the ocean was amazing.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,This is the best beach in Aruba. Large white sandy beach with calm surf where kids can swim and play. Shade and beach chairs are "free". No one tries to sell you anything. You just have peace and quiet.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Nice beach to go to. Not too many tourist. Worth the drive.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,So wide clean and clear. The water is not crowded with jet skis boats rafts etc. The sand is so white and pristine offering beautiful views.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,i stayed at Lacabana Resort it was awful. The rooms had a musky smell and the staff was not polite. This area is very quite and isolated.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,We loved this beach! Was quiet and clean. After seeing a few other places--this was our favorite spot.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,We stayed at Paradise Beach Villas right across from Eagle Beach and we spent every day on the beach for some time. Beautiful clean crystal clear warm water. Loved it!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,The resort the water and the island. We had a great time on our trip. I did a review on Aruba.com. You can check out what I had to say by reviewing the reviews.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Close cab ride to everything not very windy. Sand is white and water is very calm. Sala turtle swimming.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Was nice to be able to not have to fight to walk thru crowds and enjoyed the water with hardly anyone around.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,a terrific beach with perfect waves and delicious sun.. what more could you ask for

g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,We stay at LacabanaBRC on eagle beach every year and visit other beautiful beachs on the island. But eagle beach is still our favorite
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Clear Water waves are fun can walk out for a little bit
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Beautiful peaceful breathtaking just indescribable!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,White white sand away from the big hotels of Palm Beach but on the west side the jets skis are floating and waiting to take off stay on the east side and it almost you own private beach
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Not crowded. The beach was very clean and quiet. The water was beautiful and warm
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,One of the world's finest beaches - white sand turquoise water gentle waves and nice breeze!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Soft sand clear and calm waters. Not much more you can ask for.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,We stayed at the Bucuti so we would sit on our palapa and relax and drink all day. We did go to Palm Beach one day to compare and it was more crowded and not as clean. We couldn't wait to get back to Eagle Beach. The Beach was calm. Sand was smooth. I miss it so....lol
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,You really appreciate Eagle beach when you walk down by Palm Beach
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,We call it Aruba's best kept secret. Love being in the Low Rise area where there are no crowds or a ton of activity. Beautiful no rock beaches and you are not elbow to elbow with the next guy. Would never stay in the High Rise Area - way too many people.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Still has white sand beaches and beautiful but less crowded than Palm Beach
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Just beautiful blue waters...perfect beach and perfect weather...I'll be back soon!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Great beach for walking with miles of soft sand and the water was clear calm and perfect for swimming and snorkeling. We stayed at La Cabana and really enjoyed the tiki huts (but had to get out by 6am for a beachfront hut or 7am for one nearer the Oasis bar (closer to great pina coladas!)
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Not real crowded; beautiful sand and water! Has a nice bar on the beach but they need to do something about the fly issue.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Best beach for beautiful sand and less crowds! Low rise hotel area and less crowded. Not as many restaurants or things to do as Palm Beach.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Beautiful Beach! Plenty of space to relax and enjoy a cold cocktail.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Eagle beach has a white beach and very blue sea. It's beautiful! What I mostly like about eagle beach is that it's not so crowded. Most of the tourist go to Palm beach even though Eagle beach is far more beautiful!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,The beach is nice but very very calm. It's good if you have children. But if you like water sports the water is too calm.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,We have a time share across the road from Eagle Beach and all I can say is it is the best in Aruba and one of the best in the world.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,This is one of my favourite beaches in Aruba. It's public but so beautiful and kept clean (as much as they can). I love how open it feels with so much white sand and beautiful sea. It doesn't stay shallow for a long time so there are lots of water sports available. Yet it's safe for swimming. Just beautiful!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Get away from your hotel and hang out here! Great place to relax food is available for purchase or better still bring a launch
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Beautiful wide white sand beach. Terrific walking great people watching and warm swimming. The beach is not crowded and it's rare that a motorized water vehicle passes by.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Nice white sand.... best beach in Aruba.. what more is there to say. Can rent shade and lounges.... take your own water.... parking is near bye.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Water was still beautiful despite being churned by winds.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,This beach was fantastic. Most amazingly clear water and nice clean wide beach.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,This is a beautiful beach but not the best walking beach. More private and quiet than Palm Beach but Palm Beach has more going on. Still a beautiful beach.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Lots of timeshares and families on vacation in this area. Safe and clean beach.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,The beach is great to walk just soft sand and turquoise water. I had the great pleasure of seeing a sea turtle come from the ocean around 6:00 a.m. one morning and lay her eggs. Awesome!!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Was very clean and the water was perfect. The thatch huts on the beach were perfect for shade but if they were all taken there was always a palm tree for shade.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,white sand no rocks spotless just enough wave activity
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Clean beach with soft white sand and plenty of shade under Palapa Huts. Rental of water sport activities located right there at the beach as well as Passions on the Beach Restaurant/Bar.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,People are very friendly and it's honest the water pearl blue white sand beaches the weather no humidity. Fantastic
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,The azure waters invite you to jump in and brings out the kid in me. While other beach areas get excess seaweed on shore during the rain this one continues to be clear
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Simply the most beautiful beach on the planet.... white pristine sand... 80 degree turqoius water... no problem finding a hut everyday... never crowded... could spend everyday of the rest of my life just sitting on this beach.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,I stayed at the Holiday Inn which is in the Palm Beach Area.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,naked girls (topless) so watch out (like) to much old people
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Breathtaking beach. White sand sunshine and clear water.

g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Beautiful white sand gentle waves and snorkeling. Lots of shade opportunities.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,This is 'the beach' to be at. It's more beautiful than Palm Beach and also less crowded. No stones no sea weed just white sand and 26C blue turquoise water!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,a relaxed place. Disliked nothing about it. Great.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,The beach is not as crowded as others that are near the strip of chain hotels in Aruba. You can usually find a nice spot to sunbathe and relax or chill out in the shade.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,We loved Eagle Beach. It wasn't too crowded and the sand is so white and soft. It's a must to spend at least a couple of hours on Eagle Beach.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,We were right on the strip. Easy to walk to restaurants and market
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,The sand is one of the softest places in Aruba. A great place to watch the sun set.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Liked everything. No negatives. The people selling activities were respectful if you said NO. All the activities were great and well priced. Wonderful variety and a real blast!!!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Lets keep Eagle Beach the quiet place that it is. Walk for miles and find quiet spots where you can call the beach "yours" for the day. Ahhh.....I find myself laying on the beach at night looking up at the stars safe warm and relaxed.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Relaxing - calm warm water. nice breeze and some shade. What's not to like.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Loved Eagle beach  great place for walking less crowded than the high rise area..
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Powdery sand nice waves beautiful water. Loved it.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,The Aruba Resort was situated on Eagle Beach - take a walk down past the Ritz-Carlton Construction to take a paddleboard lesson - the waters at Eagle Beach are so calm it makes getting up on the board and paddling around great for beginners! I recommend as a 'must try' for anyone visting Aruba.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,loved the clear blue blue water - didn't really like the slant on the beach for walking - but it was fine
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Liked beach closeness to resort.Just across small street.Liked that buses stopped in front of resort to go to high rise section and even to go grocery shopping.Didn't like smoking in casinos
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,I liked the beach but the hotels were older and there was not as much to do as Palm Beach
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Beautiful water not overly crowded no pushy vendors. The white sand stays cool regardless of the temperature. Loved it!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Incredibly calm clear and turquoise water -- no crowds - serene relaxing beautifulf!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,This beach is almost same as Palm beach but resides with low rise hotels. Every sunset is a must to see. The beach is public so you do not have to stay at a hotel there to enjoy it.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,hard to find but worth it! Bring your snorkel and fins
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,A really nice quiet beach if you are on the right spot
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,To me this is one of the best beaches on the island. It is across from the low rise hotels. The beach seemed less crowded than Palm beach
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Eagle Beach is picturesque and perfect. It is as incredible as the photos the sand is fine and white. The water is perfectly warm. The contrast between the white sand and blue water make it the real life paradise
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,The right temperature..the right atmosphere.. It was beautiful and so nice to just relax and gaze at the ocean!!!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Eagle Beach is by far the prettiest beach in Aruba. There is less congestion there also. Most of the people are on Palm Beach. It is beautiful in the early mornings.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Beautiful clean and warm water. Soft sandnice beach chairs and shaded grass huts. The beach was across the street from our hotel the Amsterdam Manor; very convenient. At night the same spot turns into Passions on the Beach!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,My husband and I are staying at Renaissance which is close by and we have a car so we decided to rise over for a sunset! So glad we did as it was so beautiful here. We had a picnic on our beach towel and loved every minute!!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Love Eagle Beach it's not crowded like Palm Beach. We were able to get a papalas every time we went no matter what time of day.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,This year the beach is shorter than previous years but still very relaxing. Great sunsets. A lot of friendly people was around us.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,This beach is the best! Soft white powder (coral sand). Doesn't get hot in the sun. Hardly any shells in sand. Not as crowded as palm beach. Lots of palapas. Water sports available.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Very clean  easy access to our hotel to and from the beach . It broke my heart to see the stray dogs . Every chance I got to give fresh water and food to one I did . So very sad to see everyone ignore them .
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Very scenic what with large stones and rocks lining the beach. Water can be somewhat rough at times. Very enjoyable to lie on the beach and listen to the waves!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Bucuti section is not crowded or noisy plenty of huts bar/food service on the beach
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Wide white soft sand and clear turquoise water with waves that proved to be hours of fun for our two sons.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Eagle Beach is clean uncrowded and creates the perfect setting for romantic days and nights.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,A very peaceful location. Just hard to find a seat as you must be staying at one of the local hotels to use their umbrellas or chairs.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Amazing beach; could walk forever and the waves were beautiful!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Great for Walking Lots of restaurants and docks along the way.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Beach had beautiful white powdered sand. Water was an amazing shade of blue.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Perfect for tranquility and peace. Soft white sand and turquoise water. Rent a chair and a palapa buy a drink and enjoy paradise!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Beautiful beach with the most white sand I've ever seen and a breathtaking view of the ocean. We were staying at Amsterdam Manor and sat under palapas for shade-no "palapa wars" by the way. While we were there there were a few waves but they were fun.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Eagle beach a.k.a. the "low rise" section of Aruba is beautiful. If you want a larger beach with beautiful white sand and less congestion Eagle beach is it. There are no big name hotels on this beach as in the high rise section on Palm Beach but it is great for R&R.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Soft white sand crystal clear waters...what's not to love? If you're booking a hotel look for one on Eagle Beach! :)
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Ocean Current is strong but feels great due to heat Not too crowded which is a pleasure at times
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Eagle beach is one of the prettiest beaches in Aruba....sunsets are beautiful!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Free beach but they'll charge for chairs. White sandy beaches and clear waters. One of the prettiest beaches I've seen.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,this beach has a amazing restaurant right on waters edge very romantic as well not alot of shade though if swimming in the day
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Our resort is on Eagle Beach which is a large uncrowded beach as compared to Palm Beach where all of the international and large hotels are located. The high rise area on Palm Beach is lovely but very compact and busy. Eagle Beach has large expanses of beach and is far from crowded. Enjoy!!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,This beach is one of the most beautiful I have ever visited. It ticks all the boxes for a caribbean beach.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,It is by far the best beach in Aruba.Not crowded at all.Perfect!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Really a beautifyl beach. Gentle water. I did expect the water to be warmer but the sun is super pwoerful so maybe that is why the water felt cold.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Quieter than Palm Beach - beautiful place to watch the gorgeous sunset
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,the waves and beach are fantastic!! The beach isn't crowded and the waves are fun to play in. The motorized vehicles are kept out of the swimming area by roped buoys and this makes it safe. There is no lifeguard.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Not crowded but enough people to give it some vibe. Facilities are limited but nearby resorts provide lots of options
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,We went wave running and had so much time with the people we vacationed with Eagle Beach and the staff working at it were fabulous! They even helped us get terrific deals on other activities.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,For one thing it was right across from our resort and it had plenty of room for anyone with parking if you have to drive there. Watched the sunset from here awesome. Slightly uneven walking but that's expected when the waves come in..nice.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,This is probably the best beach. It is larger than most of the beaches
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,It wasn't crowded and great water. Lunch at passions is great as well.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,The water was warm and clean. It truly felt magical! They kept the beach clean from garbage and rocks. waves are perfect.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Our favorite beach in Aruba. If you are lucky enough to be staying on this beach you will appreciate it by walking the other beaches. Deep sandy beaches nice long walks. This is "the" premier beach on the island
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,The sunsets are gorgeous and the beach is the whitest Iv'e ever seen :D The Night walks on the beach are so Romantic and very calming :)
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Great white sand to enjoy the water able to enjoy the beach with out a large crowd did not have to get their before sun up to find a spot on the beach.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Just beautiful. I can not say one negative thing!!!!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Beautiful beach the widest beach on the island and few people
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Great beach but crowded with all the hi rise hotels.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,ideal for small children (warm water and fine sand) also alittle hidden by the big waves
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,cheap chair rentals $8 a day. lunch for $8. Big beach fun place. Sometimes it got to windy
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,A fitting front "porch" for the low-rise hotels across the street.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Much cleaner bigger and peaceful than Palm Beach. If we go back I would stay in a hotel on this beach. If you want to party go to Palm Beach. If you want a romantic and relaxing beach do Eagle Beach
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Only 1 beach bar and it's expensive. Chair rental is overpriced for cruisers!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Just stopped by to visit our regular time share. They did a great job on the lobby.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Beach sand was beautiful the water was warm and we were able to lay on our floating raft and gather the rays without worrying that we would be taken out to sea. A calm and relaxing beacu with a 3 PM happy hour.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,This is the area of the low rise hotels and the best to stay.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,water water water water...not as crowded as palm and deeper water.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Loved the colors of the water white sand and choices of things to do. It was by the high rise hotels which we stayed in the low rise hotels for less noise.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,This beach is my favorite beach in Aruba. It never seems to be overcrowded.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Niceclean beach. Too many cruise ship people that take cabanas & chairs that belong to hotels. They don't realize these beach items are NOT for them.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,This is a scenic natural sandy beach with some amenities for comfort. The wind swept trees light surf and nice sand makes it a treat. It has an unobstructed view but you have to take a cab car or bus there.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Great sand great water not crowded like the beaches associated with the high rise hotels.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Clean and uncrowded beautiful sugar like sand and nice place to swim.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Soft white sands plenty of space and beautiful blue water. Not nearly as crowded as Palm Beach and almost as nice as Manchebo Beach.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,5 minute drive from Oranjestad and Palm Beach it's worth while going to at least once. I wasn't too crazy about it. It's just like Palm beach nothing different.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,White sand and clean water and much less crowded than Palm Beach. We are happy we stayed here.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Beaches in Aruba and incredible...breathtaking view white sand and crystal blue water
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,gorgeous beach especially at the Bucuti Resort - some areas had fun waves and other areas were calm and serene
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Ah there is so much to say about Eagle Beach and Aruba! People are beautiful crime rate low unemployment rate low beautiful beaches wonderful food great shopping fun fun fun paradise! A piece of heaven!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Beautiful white sand and turquoise ocean. Easy walk on boardwalk passing many hotels and bars. Must do the happy hour which starts in some bars at 1 in the afternoon.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Wider and quieter than Palm Beach but still lots of commercial development. We went three times for walks sunset cocktails and jetskis.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,It's no wonder this has bee voted as the most beautiful beach in the world.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Nice spasious beach. You can walk and there are nice palapas to lay under
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Had a lovely Holiday and will return Prestige really looked after us and we will certainly return.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Unbelievable beach. Loved the grass huts and umbrellas for no charge right on the beach. Water was clean and beautiful. Never a crowd. This is THE beach to visit while in Aruba
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,White sand warm water quiet no solicitors perfect for a day or more in the sun. Sincerely Martin.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,The sand the surf and not over crowded just plain beautiful.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,A long stretch of fine white sand. Easy walk into the warm water -- sometimes a rolling surf. Hotels have huts but there are also scattered divi trees to provide shade. Best beach on the island.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Wide beach not overcrowded couldn't ask for more.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,I disliked nothing. Eagle Beach is beautiful and you won't be disappointed.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,The beach is amazing...a little crowded but very pretty.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Loved the beaches to die for. Location of hotel is not so great as it is not on beach but you get what you pay for. Would recomend as staff are excellent and cannot do enough for you
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Clean blue water and white sand. Amazing! The beach is not very crowded. We enjoy walking along the beach during the day. You will see locals enjoying and tourists alike. There are beach vendors to sell wave runners but are not pushy at all.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Beautiful white beaches with bright blue water what more can you ask for.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Really enjoyed this beach not as crowded as Palm Beach but still lots of water sports available.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,I have been to many Caribbean Islands and many resorts but cannot think of one that was a picturesque as this. The most beautiful water sand palm trees and tradewinds ever!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,we own our timeshare on eagle beach. it is the best beach on the islandit is long and not crowded wide stretches too we have waves which palm beach does not. love it !
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,This is a great beach in order to walk because it goes on for ever. The sand is super soft and very white. Towards the end of the beach (passions side guess that's the south end) you can get a great picture of the divi divi tree.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Although a beautiful and more secluded beach in Aruba you will not find a bar or shower to wash the sand off nearby. You may have to wait some time for a taxi. No highrises nearby.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Palm beach have the high rise hotels and crowded beaches. Nice side walk in front of hotels to check the warfs for night entertainmen. All water activites Palm Beach.Liked it the most. Eagle Beach mainly Aruba families and further down away from town.All boating and tour boats meet on Palm Beach in front of Rui or Hayyat Hotels.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,stay in the low rise district in Aruba Eagle beach is simply the best visit the high-rise district in the evenings and have much more beach and ocean to enjoy during the day on Eagle Beach
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Nobody bothered you very calm water with lots to do
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,I am here right now and it is breathtaking. I come here every year for New Years (amazing firework shows by the way) and the beach right out front from our condo is beautiful. The waves are moody but they are calm most of the time. and the sand is perfect too very clean and soft.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Loved Eagle beach not busy lots of space to park yourself for a few hours or the day gorgeous sandy beach.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Just dont miss it!.. Lovely waters white sand... what else do you want?!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,The Beach was beautiful....was very romantic walking hand in hand with my hubby watching the sunset.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Eagle Beach was wonderful for a long walk in the late afternoon when most tourists were done sunbathing and splashing around. The beach was almost empty and the sand felt wonderful on our bare feet.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,All beaches are legally open. Hotels provide amenities for those staying there. If you are under huts or use chairs "security" confirms that you are part of the property.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Eagle Beach one of the best beaches in the world. White sand blue sea and very friendly Arubian people and of course good food. What do you need more. We enjoy it every year. We also love La Cabana BRC very close to the beach
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Beautiful clean white sand beach with clear turquoise water. This beach is a must visit when in Aruba!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,We absolutely love Eagle Beach. It is less crowded and more prestige than the busy Palm Beach. We prefer to stay at the Low Rise hotels that line this beach. The waves are more prevalent here but one can still easily get into the water. Eagle Beach also is close to great restaurants and the remodeled Alhambta Casino
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,The beaches here are white and the water nice temperature We always go after 4 pm or early in the morning than it is less busy. But don't worry there is room for everyone.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Eagle Beach might just be the most beautiful beach in the world and we have seen many so we kind of know what we're talking about! The water is pristine and bright blue the beach is white as snow!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,We were in front of the Momba beach Club and had lounge chairs with food and drink offers anytime you wanted. Steps to the beach trees for shade if needed.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Nice quaint beach! Beautiful sunset! Was the nicest beach we saw this visit to Aruba! Can't go wrong by visiting
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,i go there and sit under a hut there are not many so get there early jump in the water its so clear beautiful but it lacks Fish you have to go to another beach for that attraction and i was able to get WIFI there from the hotel on the strip
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,The beach was clean and beautiful! There were areas that were a little crowded but for the most part a great experience.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Plenty of room barely any waves clear & clean water
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Eagle beach is beautiful spacious and pristine. Palm Beach tends to be more crowded and more commercial with lots more children and activities.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,The beach is clean the water is perfect... but there are plenty of fun things to do nearby.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Great place to take a walk or just soak up some sun or take a swim. There is plenty of parking and chairs for rent. Note: Not good for snorkeling
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,This beach is beautiful and very very clean. A stunning spot to while away the day. Beware of the tradewinds: you'll burn before you know it!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,We like the far end of Eagle Beach.....the "Divi" end. :)
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Awesome beach in the low rise areas. Never too crowded. Usually calm enough for children.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Heavenly blue water and fine white sand; less crowded than Palm Beach.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Crystal blue waters. The waves were very large though ive been to Aruba for over a decade. I've never seen the waves ths active. However the beach was spotless. Great for relaxing on the beach. Not good for children or swimming in general. Maybe it's just this time of year. Just be careful.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Soft sand clean beach beautiful views. The beach is quiet and enough lounge chairs for visitors. Bar on beachserved good food and drink.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Calm waters not overly crowded plenty of food and drink available. The sand is a fine white powder. You can't beat it.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,We stayed right across from Eagle Beach and loved how wide/clean it was!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Beautiful wide uncrowded beach.....go. You will not be disappointed. What a lovely beach.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,We stay at hotel on eagle beach large white sand area to walk the beach  chairs are usually taken by early am  hard to get one so we just walk the beach getting our feet cooled off and watching people.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Away from the crowds of the highrise and downtown areas
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,The best tourist beach in Aruba. Wide clean etc.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,A nice evening or morning walk before it gets hot. We never tire of watching pelicans.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Less congested than Palm Beach but still the great beach and calm waters.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,My husband and I took our rental car down to Eagle Beach on two different days. The waves are a lot stronger on Eagle Beach than they are on Palm Beach. Eagle Beach was never crowded.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Eagle Beach is gorgeous. It is across from La Cabana which is a time share property. If you drive by Eagle Beach towards town you will find more of the local population who are the friendliest people in the world!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Loved everything about this beach. Blue/green water soft sand and lovely breezes.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Not as crowded as Palm Beach. Food and drinks at the north end at Passions as well as along the southern end. Clean white sand excellent swimming. Popular with families of all ages but plenty of room for everyone.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Best beach! Never once was the sand hot on my feet and the water is emerald green!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Pure white sand nice breeze beautiful sunset. Our table was less than 20 feet from the water. We have never experienced anything like it.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Snorkle 5 steps from your beach chair. Spacious beach with well spaced huts at Bucuti - you feel like you are the only people there. White sand turquoise water. Hunting shells is as easy as bending over. Lovely.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Beautiful beach and much quieter than Palm Beach. Water seemed a tad warmer too. Not sure why. Not as busy with water sports as Palm but if you want to Jet Ski this is where it is done.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,water temp. 84!! so clear you could see and feel the fish around you
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Quieter and some of the softest sand on the island. No rocks or seaweed!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,All beaches are public beaches in Aruba. Eagle beach is long wide beautiful. Jet skis and para-sailing available. Low- rise hotels located on Eagle Beach.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,While always a favorite Eagle Beach is starting to feel a bit crowded as new time shares fill up nearby. Still a great beach to walk or swim.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Eagle beach is by the lowrise hotels. It is much bigger then where the highrise hotels are. It is not crowded. The water is clean. The sand is smooth in the water with very few rocks or shells. There are small waves sometimes but mostly no waves.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,I didn't dislike anything about this beach. It was phenomenal...great. No peddlars at all so even better.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Hands down the most gorgeous beach in Aruba. It amazes me that everyone wants to stay in the crowded high rise area...I would stay on Eagle beach (and have twice) every time. The beach is absolutely amazing white soft sand and the clearest calmest blue water you have ever seen!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Beautiful clean sun see is great. Nice ride on a boot same rain but that is like 2 minuts and is gone very hot . Nice snorkeling too many to see is a great adventure choose a good hotel and you will have a great vacations .
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Beautiful beach we spent 3-4 hours a day swimming and soaking up the sun.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,This beach is really a gem. Not crowded like the hi rise area (Palm Beach) not a lot of noise from water sports and just beautiful sand water and sunsets.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Best sand and water but no where to get drinks or food
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Compared to Palm beach that is no loud music and big crowds here  this is the beach that you say "wow" just beautiful...a great place to enjoy the sun and the water and read that book....just relax
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Too many high rises and very crowded. Good for families
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,During Low season you have plenty of area to spread out on the white sands. Water is typical mild splash for a leeward side of a Caribbean island. Nice clean beach.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Eagle Beach is absolutely gorgeous. We talked to a lot of people while we were visiting and all of the locals said they liked Eagle Beach better than Palm.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,The beach was absolutely gorgeous the water was clear and we were able to find starfish easily. There were no waves to knock you down and no boats in the area. This is perfect for snorkeling on your own or just cooling off. Greta background for pictures also.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Softest sand. Simply beautiful. Not crowded at all
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Although its a beautiful beach it is full of tourists. The water is a little foggy due to the water crafts which are offered there. I spent a day there to see what the "resort gowers" were doing but I prefered drving a little bit to visit the other beaches like ARASHI and BABY BEACHES.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Location is great nearby restaurants bars wonderful our 23rd trip there
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,It was so beautiful that the cigarettes around the beach chairs made me angry. Why be so disrespectful? If you can ignore that it's easily one of the most beautiful beaches I've ever seen.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,My brother and I did a lot of walking on the road as well as the beach.. As far as the beaches go Eagle Beach had the softest sand with out a doubt.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Soft sand warm water not crowded....amazing piece of creation.

g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,We loved Aruba the beach the people the hotel staff food and drinks fantastic weather and great entertainment too!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,white sands turquoise seas wonderful sunsets. Beach is beautifully clean and hassle free - there's nothing not to love!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Eagle Beach was not crowded we had the pristine mint green warm water to ourselves. the sand was like velvet the clarity of the water was phenmonal
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,A very beautiful clean turquoise beach with very small waves so safe for swimming and children. Free palapas just need to take your own chairs.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,This is the best beach in Aruba. It's so clean. I own at Lacabana and love going to this beach which is right across the street. I've been to all of the beaches and this tops the list!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Clear water white sand not too many people....gorgeous!!!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Beutiful beaches  wonderful hotel  super people and a climate that can't be beat. I have to say the only thing that I didn't like was the Atlanta airport - it sucks.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,clean and lots to do people super friendly. Wake up and go to sleep to good weather very safe to walk at night.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,simply the most beautiful beach on the island! nothing compares to it!!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,The sand and surf was awesome. Love the clear water. Lots of activities going on and always fun to people watch.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Relaxed spacious beach with no kids. The sand and water are amazing.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,There is only good things to say no complaints at all!
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,brilliant white sandy beach clean we were in the sea and down came the pelicans for fish and they sometimes sat there right next to us marvelous experience
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Miles and miles of white sands turquoise clear clean ocean with hardly anyone on it. A must for all travelling to Aruba.
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,Wow!! Go early beautiful beach fantastic views a must for holiday photos
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,

g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,One of the best beaches we've ever visited. Definitely less crowded than most and very good water quality for swimming. Not much to see snorkel-wise but relaxing all the same. Water sports options are available to a degree.

g147249,d150447,March 8 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 8 2016,This is probably the prettiest beach in Aruba and least crowded. The sand is soft and pretty and the water is clear. There aren't many trees or covering so you are mainly in the sun so be cautious of the heat and the strength of the sun.
g147249,d150447,March 8 2016,Quieter than Long Beach Eagle Beach is the best place in Aruba to seat under a divi divi and enjoy the beautiful sunsets.
g147249,d150447,March 8 2016,I very special beach. There are nice hotels. On beach facilities are a little sparse but the hotels all have faculties that can be used.
g147249,d150447,March 8 2016,We walked over from Palm beach and this beach is better . It's so wide the beach and the wind seemed less That you weren't hurt by the sand. The only downside I could see is that if you are staying at a resort it's quite the distance to and from.
g147249,d150447,March 8 2016,Excellent beach. Beautiful calm waters. Plenty of water sports activities nearby. Get out early if you want a hut but lounge chairs readily available anytime if you just want sun.
g147249,d150447,March 8 2016,Nice beach to spend your day at. It's a lot less crowded then Palm Beach en it's nearby the high and low rise hotels
g147249,d150447,March 8 2016,the beach is in great shape clean pristine water several water sports available. nice swimming  soft white sand
g147249,d150447,March 8 2016,Took rental car down to the beach. White sand no rocks no coral perfect beach for leisurely swimming or just floating on the water!

g147249,d150447,February 9 2016,Clean white sand an azure ocean make this uncrowned beach a world favorite. It should not be missed on a trip to Aruba! After all the beach is why one goes to Aruba in the first place.
g147249,d150447,February 9 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 9 2016,Out of 4 islands our cruise ship dropped us off at by far this was our favorite. Beautiful sand clear water excellent service of food and beverages jet ski parasail and watersports of all kinds. Can't say enough but to add I would love to come back to Aruba for a week and see everything the island has to offer!
g147249,d150447,February 9 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 9 2016,Eagle Beach is a beautiful sprawling beach with pure white sand. Any location on the entire beach is a beautiful one and steps away from the ocean. May bars/restaurants to choose from as well.........
g147249,d150447,February 9 2016,We had the most relaxing vacation on Eagle Beach. The sand and water is pristine. Better for those who want a calm relaxed vacation.

g147249,d150447,March 4 2016,This beach is the best beach in Aruba. ..no rocks deeper water and more room to spread out. And the best sunsets!
g147249,d150447,March 3 2016,Great beach for a day in the sun! Beautiful water and views and uncrowded. Not very good for snorkeling but the swimming is really good.

g147249,d150447,March 2 2016,Access from the Timeshare we stayed in. The water was wamer than the pools and not crowded. Most folks along the beach lay in the sun baking rarely moving except to grab a drink! Just another great day in paradise.........
g147249,d150447,March 2 2016,Beautiful white sand and blue water. The surf was a bit rough on a few of the days during visit but still the very best beach in Aruba.
g147249,d150447,March 2 2016,I am from the Clearwater area the #1 beach in U.S. but this beach is the best i have ever seen in my life. cristal clear.
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,Beautiful lazy day on a beautiful beach. Very busy soft sand plenty to do very trendy. Part of a shore trip when crusing on Brtiannia. Wonderful. Hyatt Hotel allows use of their facilities. Beautiful Hotel. You have to see it for yourself to believe it. Well worth the trip.
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,Eagle Beach is one of the prettiest beach that I have seen. It's a wide beach with fine sand ocean sometime can be a little rough but overall it's a gorgeous beach.
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,Eagle Beach is a beautiful beach in Aruba. Much less crowded tha Palm Beach. The water is crystal clear and beautiful white sand. Very clean.
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,Beach is beautiful. Very calm waters and you can wade a long way out in the water. Have to get there early to get a palapa. No chair rentals where we were
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,We stayed at the Oais Condominiums. Very nice large accommodations. The beach is across the street. Beach chairs are available to rent. Water sports available. About 5 bars and restaurants right on the beach in walking distance.
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,Gorgeous sand clear water and lots of waves. I find Aruba and Cuba to have the nicest beaches in the world!
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,Third visit and if God willing won't be the last. Great for the entire family. Get there early for shaded hut. People reserve huts as early as 6:30 am.
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,Tropical paradise :) definitely a great spot to relax. Crystal clear water white sand beaches we'll kept huts to find relief from the sun.
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,Eagle beach was wonderful. The beach was clean the support staff helpful. We spent a couple days just laying out and relaxing. There were attractions if you so choose or just laying in the sand was great
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,This beach is the best I have been to. It is clean has nice white soft sand and beautiful blue green water.
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,Visited other beaches on the island but this is the best for soft sand cleanliness and room to walk for a long time!

Walking down the beach it looks like the water is clearest around the Rui where the platform is. If you want to do any snorkeling that's where I'd go.
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,The beach is nice. The sand is very soft but don't understand what makes it so special. The beach is clean.
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,Very pretty beach very crowded plenty of chair.If you want to do water sportsthere is plenty of themBus drops you off right in front...
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,Words alone can't describe Eagle Beach. Clean white sands blue waters.. Look forward to going every year..
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,Beautiful turquoise water & white sand. What more can you ask for! There is plenty to do along Eagle Beach from restaurants and bars to shopping and water sports. Our favorite beach by far!

g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,This Beach is everything that I have read about. The beaches are pristine and beautiful! Prior to going to Aruba I had no gauge of what a Beautiful beach looks like. Definitely a sight to see!

g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,We really enjoyed our day at Eagle Beach it is clean safe and easy to get to. We walked to SuperFood -- about a 1/2 hour walk to get some refreshments for our day. Loved it!!!
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,Eagle beach is the best - far less crowded than Palm Beach and worth the walk down there. You can walk for a few miles along the waters edge on the most beautiful beach - soft white sand - amazing blue water.
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,Eagle Beach is by far the best beach in Aruba. Widewhite soft sand carries you to the warm Caribbean waters for wonderful swimming. Manchebo Beach Resort is the best place for this enjoyment.
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,Water sports food sun and the sea. You can walk the beach and stop at the hotels to have some food and relax for the day
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,Stayed at Amsterdam Manor Beach Resort on Eagle Beach. Proximity to the hotel was great. Beautiful white sand and blue water. Calm water - only some very small waves from passing boats and wave runners. Very relaxing atmosphere
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,We were at the north end of Eagle beach/south end of Palm beach and it was exactly the type of beach you envision when thinking of a vacation in the Caribbean. Crystal blue water lapping against soft sand beaches...
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,beautiful beach definitely worth a stroll food/drinks available at beachfront restaurant fewer tourists
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,We took a taxi up to Eagle beach tons of things to do the beach Was clean and the water is beautiful.
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,Eagle Beach has beautiful white sand and the beach is absolute perfection. The water was amazing with the most beautiful colour of turquoise. The late night walks along the beach with the moon glistening off the water was priceless.

g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,We love this beach. Beautiful white sand and easy entry into the clam clear water. Not as crowded as Palm Beach. We left just before the World Beach Tennis event was to start. It was fun to watch two years ago and we are sorry we missed it this trip.
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,Large white sand beach turquoise waters and best of all is that it is not overcrowded. It is a perfect place for a nice long walk along the beach.
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,Prefer Eagle over Palm Beach because it is not as crowded and you do not need to reserve a tiki at 6am as I did on the high-rise side of the Island.
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,big open beach with lots of sun. the water is nice and the kids enjoy playing in the sand. shade is a must if you plan to be here all day. very pretty beach a few fish if you look close beaches further north are better if your looking to snorkel
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,We stayed right across the street at a condo. Our view was spectacular as was the beach. It was quite quiet despite its reputation for being so nice.
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,if you travel to the Isle of Aruba Eagle Beach is a must-see. Beautiful clean and awesome surf. there are NO locals selling tourist cr*p. there are areas for 'free' parking. The surf is moderate. Watch for undertoes and sharp corral. The water is awesome azure color. Watch the sun as it is very intense from 11am to approx. 3pm.
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,We found this to be the most beautiful beach in the Caribbean. The sand is as white as it gets the water clear tranquil . Just cant wait to get back

g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,If you want to avoid the hussle and bussle of the high-rise area of Palm Beach this is the best. Plenty of shade great beach of a walking or swimming.
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,Very good beach less people than Palm Beach so more calm. The beach is almost the same the color and temperature of the water.
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,Perfect non stickey white sand. Beautiful blue sea and great hotels an beach bar near Amsterdam manor. My favorite beachfront to be able to get a cocktail.
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,Quiet long white sandy beach with clear blue ocean. Absolutely beautiful! If you are looking for a peaceful beach to relax on this is it!
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,We stayed at the Holiday Inn Resort. The beaches are clean the water inviting. A great way to relax and unwind.
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,One of the top three; cleaner than most and less trash than some of the other more touristy locations like Baby or Rodgers
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,This beach is absolutely gorgeous. There's very few people relative to the size of the beach and the sand is white fine powder. Very romantic.
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,Miles of beautiful white sand gentle breezes and lots of sunshine what's not to love! I have traveled all over the world and believe that this beach is the best.

g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,Beach is wonderful! Clean super soft sand and gentle warm waves... Not crowded at all. Unlike other areas of the island. Food and drink nearby. Probably one of the best beaches we have ever been on! Can't wait to go back!
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,I ran from Palm beach up to eagle beach just to see the Divi trees. It was a beautiful beach and I loved seeing the 2 trees together.
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,White sand blue ocean - just like in the pictures! Super clean and the sand feels amazing! I highly recommend a visit if you are not staying in the area
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,Eagle beach is in our opinion possibly the best beach on Aruba. It's clean in all senses no litter or detritus from the sea. There are hotels adjacent to the beach which provide food & drinks on the beach. The seawater was clear but a little rough so you needed to be ready for a few large waves.
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,Beach is so clean and beautiful. Never seen a beach is such great conditions! Water is so clear!!!!!
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,Beautiful white sand. Not crowded bar with happy hour. Easy access from our resort. If your there at the right time you can see the turtle eggs hatch.
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,This is one of the best beaches that I have been to in my lifetime. The water was warm and the sand was so soft.
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,This is a great beach but they need to put some restrooms here or some place that people can change into swimsuits.
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,Clear water very mild waves warm and sunny pretty much all the time lots of sea life and friendly people. Cannot ask for better beaches than the ones on Aruba!!
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,If you go to the end of eagle beach it is more quiet. As a photographer I love taking my clients there to use Eagle beach as a backdrop!

g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,Most of all the beaches of Aruba are awesome. Beautiful sunsets are seen while having dinner at Passions on the Beach restaurant.
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,Amazing beaches white sands clear blue water make sure you visit. The sea is calm and wonderful perfect for children too.
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,We visited while in Aruba. Very calm water and nice to just relax under a hut. Some places the huts cost $20 for the day not bad compared to other hotels.
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,Biggest beach on the island is at Manchebo Beach Resort. The beach is public but loungers are for hotel guests. You can get lunch at Pega-Pega grill with fish tacos Thai chicken kebabs or hotdogs & hamburgers.
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,It has the biggest beach I have ever seen. The water is so clear and warm. The sunset are amazing and the beach is so wide compared to other beaches in the island. Love it there!!
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,Eagle beach was beautiful - no seaweed or rocks - just clean blue waters that were cool enough to be refreshing but warm enough to be comfortable walking right in!
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,It is considered the best beach in the island. Very clean and well kept. You just need to bring your chair the government provides the place to cover you from the sun
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,nice calm beach where you can relax a lot it is also a safe place that offers different options to eat.
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,We spent a week on Eagle Beach and can't stop talking about it - we felt like it was too good to be true.. If you are going to Aruba - go to Eagle Beach!
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,If you've never been to Aruba you are missing out on the most beautiful beaches. On the north west end of Eagle Beach are 2 Divi trees that you will want to take photos at sunset. No better photo ops anywhere!

g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,The best beach. Super relaxing. The best part is at 5-6:00 pm watching the sunset. It is the most beautiful place to watch it.
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,Eagle beach is in the low rise area and is a very nice beach its very narrow in some areas. a bit crowded for my liking but overall a nice beach.
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,This is a great beach for swimming sunbathing and kids however if you were not staying at one of the hotels the loungers are limited and you will be charged 15$ per bed the cover is free if you can get one. There are toilet showers food and water activities available.
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,Plenty to do at this beach with all the water toys or you can kick make and relax. It's truly one of my favorite beaches! Bring plenty of lotion!
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,Nice white cotton sand. Not many rocks. An easy going beach where there aren't many people. Many of the private all-inlcusive beaches are nearby and are full of tourists and other people. Eagle Beach had ten on it when I was there. Fantastic.
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,Fantastic spacious white sand / sea shore crystal clear sea that just makes you want to dive straight in. Chilled out vibe  the best Iv ever been to. Can't wait to come back here  slight breeze takes the edge off the powerful sunshine.
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,I've been to beaches all over the world including Hawaii and the Virgin Islands. This beach is one of the most beautiful beaches I've ever been to. Great beach bars and palapas that are huge to help you get out of the sun in the late afternoon. Beautiful clear water and white sand!
g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,I would rate this beach above Palm because it is a wide white sandy beach with crystal clear water. Very peaceful and quite beach. Great for long walks and moonlight strolling.

g147249,d150447,March 1 2016,Eagle beach is a beautiful place in the low rise district. The beach at Oceania is not overly crowded a pleasant place to enjoy great weather and water.
g147249,d150447,February 29 2016,I loved this beach!! White sand and clear water. Water sports very cheap. We went to the flip flop concertand it was so fun and secure. This beach is a must
g147249,d150447,February 29 2016,Eagle beach has to be the most beautiful beach I have ever seen. Clear blue water huge beach area. Very quiet. Peaceful and amazing!
g147249,d150447,February 29 2016,This beach is as nice as ever. Went at least 3 times on my stay. Water was good. Didn't use much of the extra activities. But next time.
g147249,d150447,February 29 2016,We have been coming here since 1981 and the beaches are the best! They are quite wide and have plenty of palapas for everyone.
g147249,d150447,February 29 2016,Quieter and less crowded than the highrise beaches. Nice bar and plenty of shade if you want it. White soft smooth sand. Did not note any rocks and just saw one seashell.
g147249,d150447,February 29 2016,Eagle Beach is a beautiful white sand beach that actually gets warm on the feet. It sits up high from the shore so the waves are a little more forceful when they recede back to the ocean--it makes for fun floating which seems to be what most people do. There are bars nearby for drinks.
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,We stayed at the Marriott Surf Club right on Eagle Beach. Could have not have asked for more! Cabana every day no problem. Beach beautiful.  not crowded - loved it!
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,The waters are very calm on this beach and clean. It is not very crowded and there some food venders nearby otherwise restaurants within the hotels. Porta potties are across the street by paradise beach villas. Chairs and umbrellas are for rent not sure on the price.
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,Absolutely loved this facility. Condo are very nice clean and spacious. The facilities are fabulous 4 pools work out facilities tennis and basketball courts. Beach is immediately across from the condos and are beautiful. Nice areas for walking. Easy access for shopping dinning and sightseeing.
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,The white sand and clear blue water make this a great place to stay. It's possible to walk barefoot they whole way. No kelp either!
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,First time we went to Eagle Beach. Turns out to be the best. Quiete and blue and beautiful. I arrived to the beach everyday at sunrise . Watched the stars go to sleep and the sun rise. Its my beach of choice.
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,Quiet clean beach where you can peacefully sunbath on towels as sunbeds not available. Easy to enter water from the beach. Only down point are the ships if moored.
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,Husy and I went there only one day while in Aruba but but wow what a beautiful beach. We loved it because it was not as crowed as Palm Beach. We got a great view of the sunset on that afternoon which made it one of the best days in Aruba.
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,The white soft sand and clear blue water are beautiful. However the huge ships parked in the maintenance section are hideous!
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,loved the clearness of the water and watching the sunset with a cocktail in your hand wading in the water.
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,We stopped briefly on a van tour of the island. I think this area has some good snorkeling. Family fun beach. Great streatch of Beach in Aruba. Will definetly go back and spend more time on our next visit.

g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,Stayed at La Cabana resort for two weeks. Eagle Beach is great clear blue waters with little waves. Nice sand and the amenities with the beach bar are also nice. A great place to just relax and swim!!!!
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,Hardly no beach can beat this whiteluxury part of the Island. It have everything you need. Free parking spaces. Not crawded at all.
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,Not at all crowded as Palm beach lots of nature and you really feel on a virgin beach. Ocean is turquoise blue and sand is white. Most of the time is pretty empty so its ideal to rest and enjoy a beach day
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,This beach is beyond gorgeous but also hosts vacationers and locals alike. There is not any soliciting of items except timeshare sales people who want you to either trade or buy into their particular resort.
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,Beautiful beach with tons of activities. The sand is soft the beach is clean. There's always something to do and the sunsets are incredible.

g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,Spent 6days straight on Eagle Beach. Love the beach. We stayed at LaCabana and would go to the beach everyday. The water there is perfect and so clear. The beach was so clean and the sand so soft. They had a beach bar right there if you wanted an Aruban cocktail. Loved Eagle Beach
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,This beach is beautiful. We have traveled a lot and we are beach people. I can honestly say WOW. This beach is very deep very white and very soft! Then there is the calm turquoise waters that ripple up to the white sand. Throw in a few pelicans flying overhead and it is awesome. A must see when in Aruba!!!!!!

g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,We stayed at the La Cabana hotel on eagle beach. It's supposedly the nicest beach on Aruba and I certainly haven't seen otherwise. Nice sand calm crystal clear blue water. Windy but that's Aruba for you. I would recommend.
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,We stayed in Eagle Beach in September 2015 and would highly recommend it. The sand is white and the water is deep blue and clear.
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,Loved this beach crystal clear water white sand and plenty of beds huts to rent for shade loved watching the pelicans flying overhead. Lots of SeaDo's to rent  and nice beach bars as well !
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,Gorgeous beach with plenty of vendors and shaded spots. Gets really crowded so head out early for a good spot.
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,Eagle beach has a much more active surf than Palm beach making it a bit more difficult for swimming but still not so much that it's not wonderful to get in and float around. The beach is huge and very nice for walks in the evening.
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,This beach is lovely and clean. Great sunsets. Having stayed in this area which is low-rise hotels vs high-rise I'll alway choose this area. Much more peaceful and relaxing.
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,Loved this beach crystal clear water white sand and plenty of beds huts to rent for shade loved watching the pelicans flying overhead. Super spot to relax and not too busy.
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,Peaceful beach with plenty of places to rent a lounge chair and use one of the umbrella's for shade. We used chairs at the Amsterdam manor hotel. They charge 15 USD per chair per day. You get free WiFi toilets and showers.
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,I love this beach the water is clear the waves are gentle and it is quiet. I highly recommend this beach

g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,Amazing Eagle beach. White sand less hotels around very relaxing place to sunbath and enjoy the paradise.
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,Had a perfect vaca here... Stress free! The sand is s like white powder under your toes. Lots of fun activities to do at the different hotels.
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,great beach for long walks white sand blue water that u can see your feet and float and swim snorkel and watch the sun set and chill out with friendly people!
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,The Eagle Beach area was probably the nicest beach in Aruba. There were plentiful huts and the attendants were very helpful. There was a bar area and also an area to purchase water events in the area.
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,Just got back from Aruba... Eagle Beach is of my favorite beaches. I love the sand in my toes feeling the sun and the nice breeze listening to the water hitting the shore and watching the Pelicans fly overhead. This is a relaxing and quiet beach great beach for couples and for those that don't want a lot of activity.
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,This is one of the most perfect beaches ever. It is never crowded the water is so soothing. From your spot in the sand or water you can be thoroughly entertained by the people who do the water sports (jet skis). It was never a problem getting a palapa in the afternoon. The pretty water is like a screen saver.
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,Our hotel was on Eagle Beach. The sand was soft and there were there were thatch roof umbrellas everywhere for shade when you wanted it.
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,Nice relaxing day beautiful d ay in aruba this is really recommend for any one that visits aruba its free and worth it
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,Across from the low rise hotels an awesome beach! Clean beautiful sand-easy to rent chairs and canopies to duck out of the sun.
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,Very spacious and clean beach with access to food drinks and activities for all ages. Just West of the beach is a great snorkeling spot as well.
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,We really didn't do much in Eagle Beach aside from picking up our jet skis and riding in the ocean. I've heard good things about Eagle Beach though so it may be a good stopping ground 4 people visiting Aruba. As long as your on the beach you can't go wrong!
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,I Visited The Best Beach in the Caribbean twice during my 14 days holiday and each time it was paradiseI visited most of the beaches while there and would always recommend Eagle Beach to everyone I know that plans on a holiday to Aruba must bist the Best Beach on the Happy Island.
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,Great beach for enjoying sun and ocean. Chairs and bathrooms available. Great beach for walking and turtle nests in season.
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,Attended a wedding here and it was wonderful. The large white sand beach beautiful aqua water warm salt water sea. But it could blister your skin and fry you to a crisp...sun screen is a must. Beautiful sunsets.
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,VERY nice beach experience not many fish  little to see as there is no reef/coral. The sand is like table sugar. Safe swimming and no beach merchants bugging you.
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,calm waters here you can see you feet while you are in the water also the little fish that are swimming around right along with you very clean..
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,This beach was beautiful spacious with soft sand and pristine water. The views were gorgeous and we did not want to leave!!
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,Nicest beach on the island. Can walk for miles and view the clear blue ocean. Beach is very clean. One spot has a local food truck.
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,As a local I tell you this is the most clean white and safe beach on the island.It stretches out for a few miles if you feel like a walk the sun hits right for a nice tan and the buoys markings keep waters porters from swimmers safely separated.
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,Eagle Beach is beautiful. Amenities are scarce. Definitely worth a visit when in Aruba. There is not much shade available so it gets very hot.
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,Clean pure white sand with an exclusive feel due to it's massive size relative to all other beaches in Aruba.
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,A lot of sun and a clean beach with wind. And the view is relaxing.It's open to anyone come in and enjoy!
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,Visited eagle beach during holiday to Aruba. Beautiful clear waters and white sandy beach ideal for swimming and snorkling. Safe for children. Easy access from high rise area. Access from downtown via bus which only cost 2 dollars
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,Fantastic clean lovely sandy beach. However the waves in September can be very strong. Only amenities are for guests staying at Divi & Tamarijn hotels. So bring your own food and drink!
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,We found the beach to be clean great views plenty of dining options within close walking distance.
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,Mild waves allow you to just float and not get submerged. I have absolutely nothing negative to say about this beach.
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,I love Eagle beach! I have been to Aruba 5 times and stayed at Palm beach Oranjestad and Eagle beach. I love the peace and quiet of Eagle beach. The personal service you get on less crowded beaches are also awesome!
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,Clean and busy beach. We like that you are allowed to have inner tube/ floats in the water. No pesky vendors.
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,Easy place to rent beach chairs if you are not staying at the adjacent resorts. Chairs are $15 each. We parked ourselves in front of the Amsterdam Manor resort and the staff came by and collected the fee.
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,Very nice beaches in some parts. More crowded than Palm Beach. Was happy we opted for a bit north on the island.
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,The beach is long and beautiful white sand and turqoise water for the perfect Caribbean holiday feeling. For me the best part was that one could have some privacy it wasn't overly crowded. We didn't find any good snorkeling opportunities also jet skis drove often way too close to the shore but altogether we enjoyed this beach very much.
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,The beach was beautifulwell kept with great service from the staff. Recommend you get up early reserve a hut and then come back after breakfast and enjoy the beach as everything will be ready with your hut when you get back.
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,This is in 'low rise area'. Beaches in 'high rise area' tend to be too crowded for us and are not as clear due to higher level of people and boats coming in and out.
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,Beautiful beach with plenty of room. Water is cooler that the resort pool and delightfully refreshing. We stayed at LaCabana and they provided thatched roof shelters from the sun and lounges and chairs. Don't miss the opportunity to dip your feet or your whole body in the beautiful turquoise water.
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,We were amazed by the views on this beach. The sand was so fine and white. We were in about 6 feet of water and could clearly see our feet at the bottom. This was our favorite spot to swim in Aruba.
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,This was our 2nd visit to Aruba and this time we stayed at a resort on Eagle Beach. The beach is clean and not too crowded. The white sand and clear turquoise water makes for the perfect vacation. When there if you see a local vendor selling pineapple drinks get one. You will love it.
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,The beach is quite long and it not crowded. Beautiful white sand and the waves were not that huge to be frightening but big enough to body surf
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,Been in aruba 8 times ❤️ eagle Beach not as crowded like by high rise hotel area Clean sand and beautiful water Safe area still be aware of what's around you. When always on vacation
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,Nothing nicer than this expansive beach that is virtually empty! The ocean is so clear and beautiful! The waves are awesome too! One of the best I've ever been to in the world!!
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,Beach is beautiful :) I've visiting Aruba's Eagle Beach from 1999 but these past years everything is looking not very clean as is use to I know might be some people with bad manners but the Island should be taking care of that anyway to keep the turist as happy and please as before.
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,Wonderful beach very deep but be careful going in and out of the water when waves are present. Their is a dropout about 5 ft in and may be difficult to navigate when large waves are present. Bring beach shoes if your feet are sensitive. Water is wonderful for swimming
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,It is absolutely amazing: white sand beaches with beautiful colorful calm water! You can swim for hours! You can walk as long as you want! Very clean calm & relaxing!!
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,Gentle waves...stone coral and crowd free. Clean and close to all resorts. My favorite beach anywhere.
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,Busy beach full of tourists. Smell from a nearby bog (I think) wafts over the beach giving an occasional terrible smell. Few bars and kiosks means you need to bring your drinks yourself. There are so many better beach options that this place.
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,All of the beach were nice this was one of the coolest with the straw huts and friendly people one happy island.
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,Beautiful white sand beach clean and clear water not too many people. The beach is long. You do not feel walking through the people on the beach.
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,Worth the 10$ taxi ride. Take a lunch and a snorkel! THe best beach on the island and not crowded at all.
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,Our hotel (Aruba Marriott) fortunately was on this beach and we enjoyed the beautiful clear calm waters. It was not very crowded and water sports and floats were available for use. I will definitely recommend this beach and will be back to enjoy it again!
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,My husband and I spent the day at Eagle Beach. This beach is beautiful. We're from Florida so we know beautiful beaches when we see them. Soft sand and crystal blue water!
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,The sand is lovely powder sugar-like whait and never got too hot to walk on. The water was gorgeous and a nice warm temperature. Access to recliners shade and floats are great. this beach is near perfect.
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,Just gorgeous and so tranquil. I have never enjoyed a beach as much as this one. The sunsets are amazing.
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,Eagle Beach has white sand and absolutely beautiful turquoise waters. Be aware that on days when cruise ships are in it may be difficult to find a chaise rental so you'd be smart to bring an extra towel as a way of being certain that you have a place to sit. Shade is also limited so bring your sun block!
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,Awesome Beach very clean. Resorts are across the street I enjoyed beach hard to leave home. Sand was so warm and water blue.
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 28 2016,Eagle beach is the widest stretch of beach on Aruba so there's plenty of room to spread out and not be right on top of other people. The water is perfect color blue/green and not cold.
g147249,d150447,February 27 2016,I tried walking this perfect beach every day I stayed in Aruba. The view and water was just perfect. The wter was clear for miles .
g147249,d150447,February 27 2016,Marriott breakfast buffet was amazing start to everyday amazing host yangie amazing views and beyond amazing food that had us full for awhile
g147249,d150447,February 26 2016,This is a secluded beach that is very peaceful and lovely. There was a bit of trash on the beach which is why I did not give it a 5 but the water and view is lovely.
g147249,d150447,February 25 2016,I like this beach but not My favorite in Aruba. Plenty of palapas and shade to find. Waves are calm here and a lot of people. My favorite beach in Aruba is Arashi
g147249,d150447,February 25 2016,Fabulous beach. Easy to find a relatively quiet spot if you wish to relax and/or swim. Beach is free and if you bring your own chairs the whole experience is free. Chairs are easy to rent. Plenty of water experiences if you desire.
g147249,d150447,February 25 2016,Yes this is a lovely strip of beautiful white sand but it is also wall to wall people. The cruise ships bring people there by the bus load in addition to people who are staying in the area. We preferred smaller beaches in the Malmok area over Eagle beach just too many people to navigate.
g147249,d150447,February 24 2016,spent many days on the beach walked up and down a couple miles daily for exercise beautiful spot will definitely go back
g147249,d150447,February 24 2016,Beautiful beach with crystal clear water. No seaweed. Not crowded like Palm Beach. My favorite beach in the caribbean.
g147249,d150447,February 24 2016,Eagle Beach was as nice as Palm Beach as regards the actual sand and water. I found Palm Beach to be somewhat more elevated in its attractions and the number of restaurants. Passions Restaurant was worth coming over for dinner.
g147249,d150447,February 24 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 24 2016,One word PARADISE!! I have never been to such an amazing beach. White fine sand turquoise sea and blue sky Situated on the north west part of the island! This has to be one of the worlds best beaches!! I cannot praise it enough just go and see it for yourself you will not be disappointed
g147249,d150447,February 24 2016,great spot for fun and relaxation. we will gladly come back and enjoy the sun watching the sails on the sea
g147249,d150447,February 24 2016,We too two walks along this beach from our resort-Aruba Beach Club. The water was clear and calm. Nice wide beach no crowds
g147249,d150447,February 24 2016,It is quite nice sandy beach. Not too crowded. Sea is beautiful and crystal clear. Nice bars and restaurants around.
g147249,d150447,February 24 2016,My home away from home. Powdery white beaches and not too crowded It is a beautiful and peaceful place.
g147249,d150447,February 24 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 24 2016,One of my favorite beaches. If you love white sand and great beach to swim Eagle Beach it is. No wonder why turtles comes every year to leave their nest on the sand of Eagle Beach so great.
g147249,d150447,February 24 2016,Soft white sand no sharp rocks in the water. No stringy seaweed getting wrapped around your legs while playing in the ocean. This beach is incredibly wide and not very crowded. Absolute perfection! Worth noting: The staff/guests of Bucuti & Tara Hotel volunteer to clean a large stretch of the beach once a month!!
g147249,d150447,February 24 2016,Lovely beach spacious comfy sunbeds bar snacks & restrooms. Although windy was comfortable to sunbath.
g147249,d150447,February 24 2016,Eagle beach is just beautiful. No seaweed rocks or long dips in the sand. The water is clear and warm. What else would you want out of a beach ?

g147249,d150447,February 24 2016,Nice beach. Beautiful views. The water was great. There are some palm leaf awnings that are nice if you need some shade. There's also a bar on the beach with some goo drinks but between the base price the service charge and the tip they aint cheap.

g147249,d150447,February 24 2016,This is the nicest beach area I have ever seen. Not very wide but the water is cool and blue the sand is white and the atmosphere is relaxed. The palapas are so much better than umbrellas they really give a tropical feel.

g147249,d150447,February 24 2016,If you are the type that goes into the water with a martini glass then this is an ideal beach. If you would rather snorkel and see all that Aruba has to offer this place is a waste of time. I did a quick jet ski rental and left.

g147249,d150447,February 24 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 24 2016,When was the last time you did this? Honestly drop the politics your workouts the boss drop it all; just sit on the beach close your pie hole unless youre drinking a cold beer. Breathe deep and recharge your batteries.

g147249,d150447,February 24 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 24 2016,Eagle Beach is great. Laid back with a family atmosphere. You can go early morning and get a good shelter that you can keep most all day. The guys that manage these deserve and expect tips.

g147249,d150447,February 24 2016,Traveled there a few years ago (3-5). It was great. Beautiful blue water nice soft sand wide expanse of beach. Most of the hotels host palapas for shade.

g147249,d150447,February 24 2016,Beautiful beach and the water is out of this world  a must see while in Aruba. We drove to the beach and parked in one of the many public lots along the way. The beach is wide with white powdery sand and the water is just out of this world!
g147249,d150447,February 23 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 23 2016,The beach from the Tamarijn past the Divi smelled like crap all day everyday. It must be sitting on top of a sewer because that smell is so foul! I could not believe that people actually woke up at 7 am to get their spot. I on the other hand ran by as fast as I could!
g147249,d150447,February 23 2016,Warm water. Wonderful sand. Plenty of activities on offer. This is close to paradise. Only problem is the crowds on the days the cruise ships come in.

g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,The location and beach are amazing. Being able to lay out under the beach huts on Eagle beach listening to the wind rustle through the grass covering and swimming in the water were our favorite activities while in Aruba.

Green parrots cavort from tree to tree with their playful cries. Located in the low rise area with many wonderful restaurants and some on the beach for a great sunset view.
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,I have been traveling to Aruba for 15 years! Eagle Beach is by far the best beach in Aruba! White sand crystal clear water and very clean - no seaweed!
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,Eagle Beach is more "local" beach thjan Palm beach. Go here to see more of the island and meet more local arubans..And the beach is beautiful
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,By far the best beach in Aruba water is crystal clear and a lot less crowded then other beaches we visited water sports food and chairs located on the beach
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,We love this beach. The powdery soft sand no rocks or weeds make this the best beach we have seen in all our travels. It is breezy but that provides the cooling temperature.

g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,I've been to Eagle Beach a few times but the last time was so tranquil and perfect. Can't wait to go find a beach chair relax and take dips in the gorgeous tropical blue ocean waters again!
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,Eagle beach has to be one of the nicest beaches on the planet. Visited by both locals and tourists this stretch of sand delivers. Not only for its great location between the Hi-Rise hotels and low rise but also for its soft sand and glass view of the sea.
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,This beach is beautiful. While there are no waves the water is refreshing and clear. If you snorkel you will see lots of silvery fish and starfish. The palapas provide the necessary shade in order to spend a long time relaxing and the sand does NOT get hot.
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,we walked from our hotel on Druif beach to eagle beach to find the famous divi tree that you always see in the brochures. It's a long walk but well worth it. My pictures aren't nearly as nice as you see in the brochures - obviously I guess but an experience all the same.
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,Very nice beachgreat for snorkeling.We had a wonderful afternoon relaxing in the sun.Beach was very large with beautiful sand.
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,First time here and we loved it! Great for a family! The water was beautiful and was such a wonderful temp. No complaints about the tide or waves!
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,eagle beach is one of the best beaches in the world. It's clean it's waters are crystal clear. You can see your feet no matter how far you dive in. The beach is quite not crowded. You can do various excursions on the beach but most of all just relax under the palm umbrellas.
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,It was a beautiful beach but unfortunately while we were there in Feb. it was very windy all morning and early p.m. too. The water temp was just right. Not too cold and not too warm.
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,The beach here is public as are all the beaches in Aruba but this has ample parking for those not staying nearby. Chairs are for rent and the beach itself is very nice and clean. All the beaches in Aruba have COLD water. This is the ocean and it is 75 degrees and lower. Really hard to take the plunge.
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,One of the best beaches in the world--crystal clear calm waters--wide soft sand beach stretches for at least one mile--less crowded and the water is clearer than Palm Beach.
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,Beautiful beach. Nice and clean. Very calm waves. I loved that I could go in this water and see my feet!
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,Very clear waters great food good weather beach chairs available. Can be crowded at times but its less busy than palm beach by the high rise area.
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,Excellent beach White powder sand Blue/Green Water. Easy access One of the best. Plenty of places to sunbathe
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,Super clean. Free parking. Tiki huts for shade. Perfect place to spend the day. Have been all over the island and this beach is pristine.
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,Gorgeous! We stayed for sunset and enjoyed watching the sailboats go out for the sunset cruises. There was an area roped off for turtle nesting but it was too soon for them to hatch. That would have been super cool to see!
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,I love this area. Theres plenty of water activities. The sand never burnt my feet. Great family atmosphere. I see why people flock to Aruba.
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,Our favorite beach in Aruba. We have stayed in the Palm Beach area and this was our first time on Eagle Beach. Beautiful and less crowded than Palm Beach.
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,The beaches boast Beautiful warm waters with tons of activities for the fun seekers or just relaxing and taking in its beauty. We took a walk north to the ship wreck which was very cool to see in person. Everything is close to here.
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,Lovely clean  beautiful beach with the famous divi tree on it . More of a locals beach  perfectly safe and lovely restaurant on it .
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,Eagle beach is just beautiful the white sand blue ocean not overcrowded. Every morning we take long quiet walks along the beach and enjoy the sound of the sea it doesn't get any better than that.
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,Beach is awesome! It's wider near the Hyatt and Hilton and Riu but sand is cool and beach is easy to walk! Great location anywhere you stay!
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,Loved Eagle Beach! White soft sand and stunning crystal clear blue water! Kids loved it! We found large starfish while swimming!
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,This is a very beautiful and safe beach. Great walk or run. Beach is well attended-food and drink bar.
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,Beautiful! Was very windy our last day and getting hit with the flying sand stung...but guess what? We weren't at work!
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,We were staying at a hotel on Palm beach and signed up for Wave Runners with one of the activity huts. They boated us over to Eagle Beach to rent/ride them over there. It was much quieter than Palm beach and the sand and water was amazing.
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,great sand good for watersports but no bars or restaurants on the beach. a few sun shades so take some sun block!
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,most beautiful beach I've ever seen. white sand clear water and not that crowded! Perfect for a morning jog an afternoon swim and a nighttime walk down the waterline.
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,This beach never disappoints. The beach is wide white and clean. We took 3 mile walks along the Ocean. This is truly one of the top 7 beaches in the world.
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,Eagle Beach is very long and you have the possibility to feel quite remote when choosing a spot between the low and high rise areas. Aruba provides very handy wooden sunshades. I always found one available but then again I visited during low season. The beach itself is stunning. Blue water white sand no stones whatsoever.
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,Beautiful versatile stretch of beach. Public beach bars and restaurants promote an even more inviting day visit.
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,Beach is beautiful! Sand is white and water has two different colors of blue it is one of the most beautiful beaches I've been to. Many hotels one by the other and each with it's restaurants and beach snacks and juices shopping malls restaurants across the street.
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,We stayed at Riu Palace and this place is located on Eagle Beach. This place was too windy so we were having hard time staying at the beach.
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,We liked Eagle Beach because it is quieter and less crowded than the other resort beaches. The water and sand is perfect. However there are very few activities/services unless you walk to the larger resorts.
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,The water is calm beaches are white and tons of activities.Very safe  water levels are low up to kneecaps for about 25 ft out
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,I stayed in a hotel right across the street from this beach. The water is clear and beautiful there and it was rarely ever crowded. A few shacks that provide watersports are located on the beach as well as sea turtle nesting sites during June and July.
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,Calm waters. Very nice beach that offers water sport activity. Recommend for all. Good family beach. Soft sand. Not crowded- plenty of space to spread out.
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,How wonderful to spend an afternoon on a beautiful sandy beach just far enough from the typical tourist hustle and bustle. And if you really need refreshment it can be found with a little effort. Recommend you pack a cool box with your sunnies.
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,Best easy to get to beach on the island. We love Eagle beach with it's wide open sand and gentle waters. Great beach to lay around enjoy the sun sand and surf. Great beach for the kids to play at waters edge building sand castles. I think of Eagle Beach as my go to relaxing beach.
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,This is one of the most amazing beaches I have been too (and I have been to quite a few). The sand feels like velvet! The beach is completely clean and Passion's Beach Bar has the best drinks!
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,Eagle beach is great - view space amenities. Just pretty sterile for young kids. Rodgers beach Baby beach or Boca Catalina are much more suitable.
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,Eagle beach is by far the best beach in Aruba. It's less crowded than the other options on the island. Less reef drop offs the sand is smooth- very little rocks. Fewer water sport activity- which makes it much nicer.
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,Went to Eagle Beach every day across from La Quinta Beach Resort. Beach was not very crowded like beaches by high rise resorts. Very relaxing!!!
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,The pictures do not do it justice! Aruba rocks! I want to go back there one day with my children. It is a safe and beautiful place to spend a vacation.
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,Loved the white sands blue clear water the beach is not crowded lots of activities going on! during the day is very family oriented at night is a the place to party!
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,Waters are low...perfect for non-swimmers and children. There aren't a lot of crowds which is also great!
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,This has to be the most relaxing beach. The vendors are all friendly and not pushy. You have got to try the pineapple drink from the cart. Chairs cost $20 a pair and the with the blue cover was only $35 total with two chairs for the entire day
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,Off the beaten path but very nice clean beautiful scenery. Family oriented waves were a little big
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,We like the rough end of the island with its higher winds Eagle beach is a great beach but you need to get up early if you want any shade Great sands clear water just need a bit more shade
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,We stopped by for a quick swim Water was calm and clear. There are jet skis and boats near by but not close to the shore. There is a steep pitch to the shore so be careful getting in and out of the water
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,Go there. It is a quiet beach far from the lots of people at Palm Beach. Bring your stuff as there are almost no bars or restaurants around except from the hotels.
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,One of the best beaches i have seen/been to. Beautiful water long stretches of soft white sand. Very clean and safe. Many nice bars and restaurants as well as resorts on this beach as well. Highly recommend.
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,We stayed at Amsterdam Manor on Eagle Beach our favorite place. The staff are excellent and friendly. Will return ASAP.
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,wear water shoes or have a flotation device to get past the rocks when you first walk out to the water. once you are past the rocks its nice. not real clear. the beach is not super wide so it can get crowded at times.
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,was brought over to eagle beach to do jet skiing which was our first time. We had a blast and beautiful quiet beach to enjoy our adventure
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,May be the most beautiful beach in the Caribbean. Clear clean water soft sand and warm as a bath. Don't miss.
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,More of a local beach but it had strong waves and it was very chilled. I had a good time and i would go back.
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,Beautiful and uncrowded; unlike the beaches located in the high rise hotel area Eagle Beach is heaven like. The breeze is ever present and the cleanliness of the beach is nearly perfect. One can walk either direction and enjoy the water and the sunshine.
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,The Eagle Beach is a lovely place to stay with family or friendsduring your vacations. A paradise with all you must need :sunwindseasand and sports.From just resting under the sununtil practicing water sports with excelents options of restaurantsshps and a great variety of pretty places to stay.Watching beautiful peopleenjoying life. Walking on the beachswimming or surfingthe time softly flows.
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,This beach is so nice I thought twice about reviewing it! White open sandy beaches space wind heat the Carribean ( with no apparent sea monsters) diving pelicans plenty of available palapas. There are no private beaches on Aruba what's not to love?
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,Eagle Beach is just beautiful clean beautiful water calm yet warm. Highly recommend a visit to the beach.. much wider than Palm beach.
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,Liked the shells part of beach was rocky. It was nice though. Gathered shells. If I had children I would not go here.
g147249,d150447,February 22 2016,Lots going on and great for swimming and paddle boarding. Went running everyday . Lots of space and some very nice bars
g147249,d150447,February 21 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 21 2016,Beautiful beach. Fun. Tons to do for all ages. You can walk between all the hotels for many miles. Loves it.
g147249,d150447,February 21 2016,Without question the best beach on Aruba. If you are looking for white soft sand and lots of it then this is the place to go. Wide beaches without the crowds. Enjoy!
g147249,d150447,February 21 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 21 2016,The beach was a little calmer and very pleasant. I love this beach. The sunset was great and crowd was less. Great place to have a romantic picnic.
g147249,d150447,February 21 2016,Eagle and Manchebo beaches at the "low rise" area of Aruba provides lots of room to soak up some rays. My only complaint was the strong breeze that blew constantly but that certaintly kept the bugs away! Our brief visit to the "high rise" beach revealed a much less wide beach with lots of people.
g147249,d150447,February 21 2016,This beach by far is the most beautiful I have ever seen! We stayed at the Bucuti & Tara. If you stay nearby I recommend this beach for sunset strolls.
g147249,d150447,February 21 2016,Beautiful! This beach is paradise and so nice! The beach is perfect white sand and the clear crystal blue water makes it picturesque.
g147249,d150447,February 21 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,Great beach. Amazing weather and you must go to see yourself. Went there for the day from the Azura ship. Lovely sandy beach and don't forget to have a Pain Killer from the bar or maybe 2.
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,The beach was wide beautiful and not crowded. Great for beach walking and visiting other hotels for happy hour along the beach.
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,White sands crystal clear waters and not a lot of people. Plus the sea turtles come to nest here. Not far from any resort.
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,Water is turquoise sand white and soft feel like baby powder. Water is very calm. Less crowded compare to Palm Beach. Went in July 2015 weather windy hot and humid. Make sure you to apply sunscreen.
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,This was by far our favorite beach in Aruba. The sand is awesome the water is beautful and the beach is huge. You cannot go wrong by spending a day (or your entire trip) on this beach.
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,This beach is lovely and wide and white and warm. One of our favourite beaches to visit and we spend a few fab afternoons reading and swimming and enjoying the white sand.
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,Eagle Beach has a strong current and it's very windy. But it's very fun to play football volleyball etc because there's allot of space. And the sand is very white and the water is very blue.
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,Eagle Beach is absolutely beautiful. The water is gorgeous and the sand is like powder. The tiki huts provide shade from the sun. It is a very relaxing way to spend a vacation. There are water sports available for rent if you so desire.
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,water is calm warm and soooooooooo relaxing. You can rent floats jet skis and just have fun doing water sports--all available just steps away
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,Avoid the crowded high rise beaches in Aruba and go here! Beautiful water far fewer people and vendors and gorgeous sunsets.
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,White soft sand... Chrystal clear blue water... There is nothing not to love. Most beautiful beach in my opinion.
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,This beach is just superb. Sugary soft white sand and perfectly clear water. We spent a lot of time on this beach and will return to Aruba in the near future simply for this beach!
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,Eagle Beach vis a vis Palm Beach seems a bit windy less developed and studded with Fofoti and Dividivi trees. Perfect for windsports.
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,Love it! Visited a few years ago but this time returned with the kids. They too loved it and want to go back.
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,This is a great beach to visit. The beach was clean with the softest sand beautiful waters and a constant breeze. There is a designated swim area which is nice because there are many water sports vendors on the beach. There were a lot of jet skis in the water at times.
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,Beautiful beach overlooking gorgeous blue & Aqua water and sections protecting sea turtle nesting places are clearly marked. Trade winds keep you cool and walking trails are available if you don't like walking on the beach. Must visit this clean & beautiful beach!
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,Spent a few days on Eagle Beach and loved every minute of it. Wind never stops blowing but blowing sand was never a problem. Clean and well maintained.
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,The beach was beautiful any time of the day. It was clean the water was warm and never crowded. The attendants were always will and able to assist with all of my requests.
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,It's one of the most beautiful beaches I've been in. White sand clean water and it goes on for miles and miles.
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,Beautiful beach clear waters! There were a lot of pigeons recently which I have never seen before in Aruba. Some parts of the water have more sea-weed than others but overall a lovely beach.
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,Eagle Beach is one of the best on the island. Not only is not overcrowded it is calm and there are a few Beach Bars available for refreshments. Were as Palm Beach is so over crowded due to the Hi Rise Hotels Eagel Beach caters to hust a few Low Rise Hotels and a couple of Condos.
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,Stayed at a hotel in Eagle Beach with my wife and she is a beach person and she was trying to decide if this was the best beach at which she has ever stayed.
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,There is no other beach in Aruba that is so large if you stay at Manchebo Resort. The cabana's are not close together you can have drinks/lunch brought to your chair/table. It's heaven.
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,All the Aruba beaches are brilliant. Nothing to dislike here. You can walk for miles on the beach in front of the hotels and there is plenty of places to eat drink or just sunbathe
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,Calm waters clean white sands that feel like powder on your skin. You can keep cool under the hotels cabanas. If you are not staying in that hotel you can rent the cabanas. Not lighted so feels a bit deserted at night.
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,This white sandy beach is very clean and comfortable on the feet. There was plenty of space and the beach area is wide. The water is clear and beautiful shades of blue and green. Can't beat it! Water temperature was a little cool but refreshing!
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,Great beach to relax and take in some sun. It was so quiet and peaceful and the water was very calm clear and clean.
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,Breathtaking beach. We were sandblasted as we sat on the beach but that barely took away from the experience. There is the ability to rent chairs and depending on what hotel you rent from are included in your stay.Blue waters white sand...what more do you need?
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,sand is white and soft. chairs set up right along the beach and just ask for towels from the hotel. lots of activities to do if you wish such as cayaking or paddle boards.
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,We took the public bus from our cruise ship a very convenient and affordable option. The sand was very comfortable and the beach very nice but a bit crowded. Plenty of eating options.
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,We loved this beach it was quiet a nice constant breeze there were waves but not overwhelmingly so and it was clean. They would have a machine rake it in the morning. Very Nice you can't go wrong spending a day or two here.
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,White sandy beach not too busy. Great hotel close by. Easy too park the car. Sea is quite charm but it get get windy especially in the afternoon's.
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,Coco takes good care of me. The ocean is beautiful and clean Not only does he watch for us he is considerate and friendly
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,This beach is perfect for everyone: glittering ocean chairs and umbrellas available for rental juice bar on the beach and plenty of activities within walking distance. Plus it's right on the bus line.
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,This beach is beautiful and not as crowded as Palm Beach but also with less activities. Still a beautiful beach.
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,My wife and I spent 4 days at the MVC Eagle Beach Resort right across the street from Eagle Beach. We fell in love with the pristine white sand and beautiful Caribbean water. The sand was soft and extended right into water. We were grateful for a beach with no vendors constantly hounding you as in other areas.
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,Eagle Beach was across the street from our resort and it was beautiful clean very relaxing and not crowded. You can rent jet skis if you want to and there were a couple of food/beverage vendors as well.
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,This beach is one of the most beautiful that I have ever been to. The water is so many colors is nice and calm for floating and crystal clear! Perfect soft white sand.
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,The best beach I have been to. The people are nice and friendly.The water is clean and apr. 30 degrees all year.
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,Great spot to chill out on the beach with wait staff serving you drinks and food without getting up and chasing for drinks
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,This is one of the most beautiful beaches we have experienced. Quiet and relaxing! Not crowded and very nice beach to walk.
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,Eagle Beach is a beautiful beach with views of the coastline. It's true what the previous reviews say about this beach catering to the people who stay in the hotels nearby and it's much more quiet than Palm Beach which bustles with activities.
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,Awesome expansive beach. We were there in late June...it was pretty windy. There were a great number of free chairs and no shortage of real estate under the umbrellas and palapas.
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,Beautiful and convenient. Never had a problem getting located by the water. The waves were great. Never crowded.
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,Great beach much quieter and more relaxing than the high rise district. Less crowded and easy to get to anywhere with a cab.
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,I've been to Aruba about 10 times over the years and I would rate Eagle Beach as the best on the island. Close to a ton of great hotels and restaurants. Warm water and fine sandy beach.
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,We love the access to eagle beach you must get down there early to snag a tiki hut though and I mean like 7:00 am. The regulars get down there at 6:00 am to grab their tiki that they are used to getting every year. Happy Hour and bingo lots of fun.
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,Be sure your hat has a strap! It is very windy. Water is pretty but bring your own chairs or be willing to pay.
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,If you visit Aruba for vacation or on a cruise this is the best beach. Super clean not overly crowded beautiful white sand and water sports available
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,Wow....i stayed on palm beach..but the action is on eagle beach...beautiful..just a few minutes from the hotel we drove here..and expend the whole day on eagle beach you actually enjoy the beach is windy but not as much as palm beach.
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,

g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,Just an incredible beautiful beach with lots of spacebut still possible to buy whatever you need of food and drinks.
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,Beautiful sand low surf perfect water temperature. You can use the palappas with your own chairs but if you use the existing chairs beware the $10/chair fee that you will be asked for by a beach attendant employed by the local resort.
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,I believe we were in between Eagle and Palm Beach so our review would be the same for both. The beach and water were wonderful. Clean. The palapa's were wonderful to sit under.
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,We visited Eagle Beach on a Monday we rented 3 chairs and a cabana for $43 USD. It was a windy day so we were pelleted by sand which the cabana helped with. The water was very nice and we walked across the street to one of the hotels for lunch and you can also buy drinks on the beach.
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,I was there for a short time. I went to a hotel to get a massag on the beach. The beach is beautiful and quiet. There are restauarnts set up on the beach but it is more of a relaxed atmosphere. It is gorgeous!
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,Aruba is very relaxing atmosphere. Great place to relax and be happy! The beaches are clean and the sand is so soft!
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,beautiful. the farther north the quieter the beach becomes. The ritz is about where the sand ends and rocks begin.
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,The water was blue and clear. The sane was white and clean. But the wind blew the sand and made it too hard to sit on the beach bu great for walking near the water.
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,White sand blue water no pushy sales people or beggars. This was in my opinion the best beach on the island. I visited Palm Beach (very commercial) lots of water activities and pushy sales people and Baby Beach which was on the south end of the island so pretty far from everything else.
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,Beautiful beach with trade winds and turtle nest areas that are protected and monitored. The beach was uncrowded with white sands that never get hot. Palapas and chair available for rental on beach. Snowcone and beverage stationsdot the beach and there are jet ski rentals too. Eagle beach is home to the famous Divi trees. Great photo op.
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,We stayed in Amsterdam Manor across the street (LOVED IT-see my review for that if you like). The beach is calm and not too crazy busy. So if you want a relaxed beach thats not congested look no further.
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,Beautiful beach very clean laid back and has a lot of things to do there. The snorkeling is good and it was not crowded at all. I thought that this beach was actually the cleanest beach on the island
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,Beautiful beach with opportunity for water rentals. Not too near public restrooms but available with a bit of a walk. Expensive to rent chairs. Can be crowded but the water if gorgeous and clean. We enjoyed it there.
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,I am travel all round world and I see many beautiful beaches.This is one period. We enjoined so much. Highly recommended for anyone!
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,One of the best beaches in Aruba. We usually stay right across the street from Eagle Beach. The beach is beautiful and very enjoyable to swim.
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,This was our second trip to Aruba we also went last year. Eagle Beach has to be one of the most beautiful places on earth! From the incredible soft white sand to clear blue water. Already booked for next year!
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,A much quieter beach than Palm Beach. Much prettier and a lot less crowded than other beaches in Aruba. Even if you're not staying at a hotel you can rent lounge chairs for $10 apiece and the cabanas are free.
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,A peaceful and relaxing beach in the low rise area. Not too crowded. Absolutely the best beach on the island!
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,The beaches on Aruba are fabulous clean and romantic!!!!!!The colour of the sea is unbelievable The sand is as white as possible. There are a lot of trees.
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,Pristine white beaches turquoise waters serene surroundings -- what more could a beach lover want!
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,Beautiful beach because it is not in front of the trendy hotels. It is very natural and gorgeous but be prepared to have a hard time renting chairs! Still worth it.
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,The beach was beautiful with fine white sand and pretty deserted. Great for peace and quiet lying on the beach vacation. I noticed the big waves though that our tour guide said was abnormally big because of the winds that he said was not normal for that time of year. Not really for swimming when we were there.
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,Definitely the nicest beach I have been to. Clean and not overcrowded! A true beach lovers place to be.
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,Nice place to walk and go for a swim. The only problem I found was really busy with jet skis. And they were not polite about us swimming or walking the beach. The drove right in front of us while walking the beach to bringing a jet ski to customer and drove right onto the beach.
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,My husband and I went to aruba for our one year anniversary !!! It was gorgeous. The ocean is crystal clear no rocks or sea weed. We rode the jet skis which we rented on the beach. Absolutely amazing!! They have beach chairs for rental at a modest price. Would definitely go back. ☀️🌊
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,We stayed right on this beach and it couldn't have been better! The sand was so nice the weather perfect everything about it was GREAT!
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,This Beach is amazing beautiful soft sand with turquoise waters bit choppy in areas seemed calmer toward Palm Beach. Lovely & warm with plenty of marine life
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 20 2016,Shallow sandy long beach with good road access by the lower hotels shelter options some food and drink options along the length able to have your own space given its size. Popular for sunsets across the sea.
g147249,d150447,February 19 2016,White sand blue water and sunshine. You can't go wrong on this beach. You can rent chairs for $10pp for the day. There is a restaurant and bar right on the beach and convenient and clean bathrooms.
g147249,d150447,February 19 2016,Lovely just lovely. Not crowded. Great place to walk or swim in the waves. Beautiful blue Caribbean water awaits a visit. Remember all beaches in Aruba are public. Tends to get busy on Sundays. So if busy bothers you visit any other day!
g147249,d150447,February 19 2016,If you love beaches and a mindless vacation come down to the high rise section of Aruba stay at any of the properties or hotels and just chill out!!!
g147249,d150447,February 18 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 18 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,The beaches kind of run together in Aruba with Palm Beach close by. Great sand and beautiful water color with plenty of space makes this side of the island a great place to hang out.
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,We own a time share here! The accommodations are good! The facility is kept up nicely. The beach is very close and the staff at the beach are vey accommodating.
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,The water sport activities are so fun ! My family and i did the water tube. So much fun. Very relaxed beach not many vendors on site so it's a good idea to come with lots of water and snacks !
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,I tend to stay in the high rise section to be closer to the proverbial "action" but to experience utter tranquility and vast beaches I highly recommend walking Eagle Beach. You'll find a mix of natives tourists and expansive white sand.
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,Quiet area with more waves than Palm beach. Picturesque beautiful. Stopped for photos and to pick up seashells on the way back. Such a beautiful sight to see. If you're looking for a more quiet set up this is the place to be.
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,Eagle Beach is a beautiful beach with clear water and white sand. Less crowded than Palm Beach but both are wonderful beaches!
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,Eagle Beach was amazing!! The water was so clear and blue! We saw other beaches in Aruba and they were beautiful as well but Eagle Beach was my favorite!
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,Widest soft white sand beach in Aruba beautiful turquoise water. Shaded picnic areas & parking available. The famous fofoti tree pointing towards the Caribbean is located here.
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,White sand blue water clean breathtaking....everything you expect to see on a remote island on the middle of nowhere...I loved this beach!!!
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,Love the beach calm clean and beautiful! I could stay all day in the water. I was hoping to see turtles...
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,A very wide beach with nice white sand leading up to fairly calm warm waters. A little more wave action than at the Palm Beach and the wind here is a little stronger since it's less protected. Limited facilities - there's a few shops and restrooms at the north end of the beach but nothing elsewhere
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,Beach was quiet and clean! There is so much to do... Jet ski catamaran paddle board kayak tubing and more.
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,Nice mix of water sports and seclusion. restaurants walking distance. cabana's and chairs available for rent. This is important. Most of the hotels on Aruba have chairs for guests only made if tough to investigate other beaches etc. Finest/softest sand in the Carib. Good for windsurfing kite surfing Bad if you like waves and surf.
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,Eagle Beach has nice sand and is the perfect beach for walking/swimming/playing/Biking/ and watching a breathtaking Caribbean sunset. Or if you want to read under a Divi Tree you can do that as well.
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,No relief from the wind. With 20mph winds all day it sometimes feels like a sandblasting machine. No private beaches though so anyone can go. The Hotel had folks stationed there to care for your needs.
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,Best beach on the island. Wonderful sunsets. Beautiful water with gentle waves. Great to take a stroll in the early morning or at dusk. Not crowded and there is plenty of public beach to use if you are not staying at the nearby resorts.
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,My wife and I took a long swim and loved how clean and white the beach was we were even able to see a few fish swimming around us on a few occasions. If you are looking for a a day at the beach to remember then this is the place for you. Dale and Naomi
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,Lots of people in the hotel zone will walk from Palm Beach to the calmer less crowded Eagle Beach. The water is choppy but most beaches are that way in Aruba. There were tourists fishing and relaxing every morning. One of the most beautiful coastlines I've ever seen.
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,Loved being the only people on this pristine beach.. The down side to that is you must be sure to leave your valuables somewhere safe.
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,Loved It Love It. Clean peaceful and excellent review. The absolute best beach in Aruba. Depending on the Resort they have cabanas on the beach ready for your relaxation
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,We had a great time so crystal clear water and relaxing day the reason i give a 4 star is the taxi driver that took us there was so negative and insulting to tourist calling us cheap had to remind her that we tourist keep he with a job and of course did not give a tip.
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,If you're in Aruba  Eagle Beach is the beach clear clean and warm. Daily cocktail specials with wait staff service for food and drinks.
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,This is a lovely beach and at this time of year very interesting with the anticipation of seeing a turtle nest hatching! The water is calm and a great place to just float and be thankful to be in Aruba!
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,Beautiful white sand clean...never felt hot to the feet with 90 degree temperature...water blue & walking the entire beach was a great experience with my wife....did it 4 times during our stay
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,this is by far the most beautiful beach on Aruba pearl white sand so soft to walk on a perfect breeze always enough space around you.lot's off shade. and i love the bar on the beach in front off the amsterdam manor
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,beach is clean and the water is beautiful..they have a few tables here and there where they are covered..no rest rooms
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,We stopped and took pictures as this is a Must Do in Aruba! A pleasant beach and lovely white sand.we can tick the box
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,Maybe it's just us but the laid back feel of the low rises on Eagle Beach fit us petfectly. No fighting for a Payapa very little traffic and nice people everywhere. The beach is beautiful and we rent a car for our two weeks a year so can go to any of our favorite restaurants.
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,The water was really calm and there was a lot of kids in this area. Great for families and there were also several options for water activities/excursions!
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,Eagle beach is where low cost hotels are. It is long and very wide. With plenty of room to make you feel you are at a secluded beach but you are not. It has a lot of trees for shade if you don´t want to pay for a parasol. We stayed late and felt safe.
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,Brilliant calm turquoise water against white sand! No crowds no screaming kids just relaxing. After you have been to this beach you know why they call it "One happy island"!
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,If you like walking on the beach Para sailing Jet Skiing or tubing with out large crowds this is the beach for you. The beach is very clean and well maintained you will hate to leave. Rest here for awhile
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,The best beach in the Carribean! Large beach no children in our area great clear water a place to relax.
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,One of the top 5 beaches I have seen in my travels all over the world!! It is very wide and long. Beautiful white sand and calm clear waters.
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,Not overly crowded...beautiful and clean...had to wait for towel service a couple of times but not TOO bad!
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,The wind was so strong that the sand slammed into you as well as other guests belongings. Water was beautiful.
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,Great beach for relaxation but you not going to have restaurants or bars you will need to bring your won food and drinks .
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,Expansive sand -- feels like you own the white sandy beach! We read and played backgammon under the shade of our Bucuti umbrella. And we swam swam swam and walked the shoreline too.
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,This is a beautiful white sand blue-green clear water beach. Absolutely gorgeous. There's not a lot to see if you like to snorkel. If you love a beautiful Caribbean beach to relax and swim this is the place. The wind can be stong and whip the sand at you but that's only certain days and common at Aruban beaches.
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,Had a great time in Aruba visiting Eagle Beach. Beautiful and secluded area for snorkeling. Arrived with Ralphie our tour guide from ABC Travels during our Baby Beach Safari. Had a wonderful time.
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,just too windy over that side. Is very beautiful but you can't even walk along the beach without the sand blowing in your eyes. It's totally different just up a few hundred yards.
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,This is a very attractive beach. It is huge in length and there is plenty of parking (even some trees to park under). Lots of palapas beach chair and toy rentals. VERY windy in May
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,Beautiful sand gorgeous sunsets and not crowded. Cabanas were a great place to relax. Water was clear and pleasant to be in.
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,We didn't dislike any thing! We loved sightseeing shopping swimming & the food. Everything was GREAT!!
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,Loved the Fofoti trees clean and pristine beach. We had our photoshoot there and had an amazing time! Went Jet skiing and had a blast.
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,This beach is breathtaking. Pure white sand..crystal blue water. The wind can be a problem. Sand will blow and can hurt when it gusts about you..but the beauty is a marvel. I thought I was in a postcard. I highly recommend a visit to this beach
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,We took a taxi here from our hotel. We meant a couple from Canada and visited for a bit. We ended up leaving after just 2 hours to return to Palm beach. The water and beaches just seemed cleaner there and there was more shade available without have to pay for the hut and each chair individually.
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,Never had to wait for a spot on the beach just see the guard and they put your chairs / loungers out for you.
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,The surf and beach itself aren't as appealing as so many others. The surf isn't as peaceful and the sand quality is rougher than the many alternatives. Still spent several days there and found it enjoyable.
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,Well since the two beaches are only a few miles apart what separates them are crowds walks on the beach and waves. It's less crowed at Eagle beach but harder to walk on the beach and bigger waves. It's nice to get both beaches under your feet.
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,This beach is in the middle of all the beaches in Aruba it is beautiful sand is warm and mushy to the feet....loved every minutes of it. The water is emerald blue/green just lovely....very cool once in the water....the beach was clean no debris or trash. Relaxing in the lounge chairs and enjoying the water.
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,I love Eagle Beach and this trip was no exception. White sand and blue water. We were lucky to snag some free floaters from the hotel so we could really laze around in the water.
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,We have owned timeshare on this beach for 30 years. It is in a word gorgeous. White sand turquoise water. Perfect.
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,White sandy beach calming waters...what more can you ask for. In Feb & March it's really hard to get a hut and some shade but it never seems overcrowded. Nice little bar on the beach so feet in the sand and a drink in your hand..all I can say is ahhhhhh.
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,The water was very clear and clean . was our first time in Eagle Beach we love the place. We will go back.
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,The beach was beautiful clean very nice soft sand. Chico the man gave us our lounge chairs he was extremely nice we had a great time very clean very serene
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,We didn't have trouble finding chairs under a palapa any day. The beach was pretty quiet and the bar was conveniently located on the beach.
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,I have been to many beaches and islands in the Carribean. If you are looking for the finest white sand the clearest warm aqua waters and quiet relaxation--- it is for you! Not over populated at all! We saw many fish a starfish and a stingray (but we were looking). Perfect!
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,Nice public beach. Peaceful with no commercial trappings of Palm beach. Not crowded. Easy access. Perfect for an easy lay out in the sun kind of day. Not for people looking to rent jet skis para-sail etc. Go to Palm beach if you want that. This beach is just a simple nice white sand beach.
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,Still not my favourite beach on Aruba Island but definitely much nicer than Palm Beach. Without the so called low-rise resorts the beach definitely would be almost perfect!
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,I stayed at the Amsterdam Manor and that end of the beach is not crowded at all. It also has the tiny trees that are well known in Aruba. There are watersports available as well.
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,Palm Beach doesn't compare! Peaceful - no hustle and bustle here! None of the resorts sit right on Eagle Beach so it is not jam packed with excursion booths restaurants chickis chairs and tourists. The sand and the water are pristine...just gorgeous!
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,The swimming the beach and the pool. Many restaurants to choose from. Walking distance to all hotel casinos and shopping.
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,Beach parties during Soul Beach Music Festival were awesome. Beach is where the resorts and casinos are located.
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,Eagle beach is my favorite as it is not overcowded. To start in the am to walk along the beach is fantastic! We stay at the Amsterdam where plenty of chairs & umbrella huts are available at any time of day. Great bar & food area! everything is right there & immaculate!
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,Best beach by far. Plenty of clean sand to walk water is wavy but calm. Could use a few more of those huts though!
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,liked the lack of people the lack of vendors (at least right across from the hotel); disliked the intense wind (but that was seasonal)
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,The beach was quiet but offered many activities and water sports. We participated in the banana boat and jet skiing but witnessed Parasailing paddling boats tubs etc. All local but didn't attract much noise to interrupt relaxation
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,Beautiful sand beautiful water and ahhh-mazing scenery! One of our most favorite beaches in the world!
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,nice sand warm gentle waters. Caution that an umbrella or some source of shade is ESSENTIAL even in March. Otherwise you will fry to a crisp. Any spot I missed with sunscreen the sun found.
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,This is one of the best beaches if not the best beach in Aruba! Powder white sand and crystal clear water! The beach is huge so it's not crowded at all!
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,Near all of the other high rise hotels. A walk down the beach gets you to water sports palm thatched shops and places to eat.
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,We love Eagle Beach for it's white sandy beach and beautiful turquoise warm waters. Wonderful area in Aruba.
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,All likes no dislikes. Resort was convenient to beach bus stop and taxies were readily available.
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,Eagle Beach offers a great swimming experience. The water is calm and clear. The sea breeze is very relaxing and hypnotic. A great place to take a nap read a book and have a few drinks
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,What can I say white sand clear turquoi water cool winds beach bar by La Cabana and less crowds.
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,Loved everything and the staff is amazing. Planning to go back to this place in the next year. Great Honeymoon spot and for couples.
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,Beautiful Beaches of Aruba always enjoy walking the beaches in the early morning and enjoying the daytime swimming and sunning. Perfect way to relax.
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,We rented from Avis car Right across the street from RIU at the Mill Resort. Cheapest price I found for a 24hour rental everything included $50 and fill the tank after which was $10 I have the contact if anyone needs it
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,If you like crystal clear warm brilliant turquoise calm waters then Eagle Beach is the place to be! It is by far the best beach in Aruba for beachgoers of all ages! I've already been twice this year and have another visit booked in a few months!
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,The beach was beautiful. The sand felt so nice to walk on. Surprisingly the sand wasn't hot even though it was 90 degrees. The water a little cool but was extremely calm.
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,beautiful long and full of curiosities ;-) I really liked that beach. A bit far by foot from main hotels area but if you don't mind walking under the sun or waiting for the bus (one per hour) you will find a way to go there.
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,Eagle beach is the best beach in Aruba Large beach close to everything? Love the white sand and blue water 
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,White soft sand and clear blue water is what you will find at Eagle Beach. It has chairs water sports food and drinks too. The best part is you can watch the sunset from your chair!
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,we stay here with friends and love it.i wouldn't stay anywhere else but eagle beach it is so beautiful
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,nice beautiful public beach. which is were our wedding coordinator set up for us to be married. it was lovely.
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,Best beach clean no sea weed or rocks. Entrances to all major hotels. Chairs and umbrellas available.
g147249,d150447,February 17 2016,Stayed at Oceania resort right across from eagle beach. Beach is amazing. Soft white sand and very clean. Also the nice thing is it is never very crowded. Water is very clear and perfect for swimming. Pretty windy but all of Aruba is windy
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,eagle beach is the most beautfiul beach of the island... during the week its quiet and good place to relax but during the weekend you will have the local and some party at night....
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,There is nothing wrong with Eagle Beach but neither is it super special. A great beach to bring your chair and umbrella and enjoy the sun sand and water but not a great snorkel site. Parking free and convenient and given its large size not crowded.
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,Beautiful view crystal clear water and very nice beaches. A little bit more wind on this curve of the island.
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,This beach was right across the street from our condo. Nice sand...not too crowded. Could rent chairs on the beach but had to be up early to get a palapa.
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,Probably the best beach in Aruba. Water is clear and of a beautiful aquamarine color also free of seaweed (unlike other beaches around) white soft sand. We enjoyed some cocktails and the superb view from upstairs at jimmys ocean view bar. Parking is easy.
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,My husband and I enjoy the gorgeous sand and beach. The chickees right at the water and everyone is wonderfully amenable to sunning and enjoying ourselves.
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,Beautiful white sand beach! Lots of space to enjoy and on beach facilitiesd and amenities. Watersports food drinks chairs etc. all available for purchase or rent.
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,Maybe the expectation of #1 rating was the reason for disappointment. The beach wasn't all that special. Grand Turk St. John & St. Thomas just a few places with beaches that blow away Eagle Beach...but I guess specific to Aruba the beach earns it decent rating.
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,It IS one of the most beautiful in the world. We lov all the beaches in Aruba but have to agree with those who say nthis is one of the top ten in the world!
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,Yes it's a nice beach. Pretty. However I don't appreciate the chair rental people. Very annoying. I prefer the beaches up North. You can bring your own chairs and nobody bothers you. Also not a good snorkeling beach at all.
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,This is a truly beautiful beach one of the nicest we have seen. The sand is white and not hot under foot. When it's more windy the coral can hurt feet in the sea so take shoes just incase.
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,Watch out for the wind the sand can exfoliate you whether you want it or not otherwise great beach.
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,If you like the beach and the ocean you will love Eagle Beach! The water temperature is perfect and the sand is like velvet under your feet.
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,Warm blue white sand beach many additional atraction  para sail jetsky diving experiencies etc. being in the low rise area is not so crowded as other beaches  may be too windy in the march - may period.
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,We had heard how great this beach was. It is not as good as Palm Beach in our opinion. We went there in the AM and there was garbage on the beach.
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,White sand soft to the feel crystal blue water. In the low rise section. great to walk occasional fisherman. Watched Sea turtle return to the ocean at 6 AM
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,Loved everything about it other than the wind which whips you in the face but sometimes feels good with the heat
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,The most beautiful beaches in Aruba. The beaches at Eagle Beach are uncrowded and nices we have seen in Aruba
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,Just loved it! Convenient clean plus you do not have vendors hounding you to buy things that is not allowed here which makes it the perfect vacation spot!
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,We stopped at a quiet area and got to sit and enjoy the beach with hardly anyone around. Our resort beach was very crowded and this was a pleasant relaxing location. Warm water and great for those that don't enjoy the big waves.
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,Eagle Beach is our favorite place in all of Aruba. The water there is a beautiful color and the beach huts provide perfect shade. It's usually very quiet and serene. Love it!
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,whats not to like it was amazing beatiful white sand geougous blue water the huts all over the beach area  lots of outdoor activitys to do
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,Hotel resort not up to my liking at all! Musty hotel room with carpet loud AC we got here early afternoon so buffet was depleted no premium liquor when the amenities said it carried such just to name a few...
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,heard this was one of the nicest beaches close to the cruise ship. About 10 min cab ride. beach nice but not amazing. water a bit chilly which was surprising. VERY windy which we were told is almost always. Got sandblasted due to wind. Not enjoyable. disappointing.
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,My sister was staying at the Divi Links while we were at the Surf Club. We visited this beach twice. Very nice clean and lots of waves. Can't complain about this Aruba beaches. :)
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,Beautiful white sand and turquoise water! This area has a lot of the high rise hotels around it. The water is so clear and good for snorkeling.
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,Azure sea crystal clear and fine white sand perfect Quiet too at Bycsti area no screaming kids motorised waterspouts or vendors yippee!
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,Prettiest beach on the island!! Pristine white sand long empty stretches of sugary coast suitable for adults and children (accompanied of course by parents) alike. If you get tired of walking in the surf low-rise hotels are just steps away and offer the weary jogger instant refreshment. This beach can't be beat!
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,Clean Calm Nice Breeze Warm and Friendly service. Sand Bar is great all day and Especially at Happy Hour 4 to 6 and 9 to 11pm.
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,The water is crystal clearwhite sandy beachwater sports available for a fee.Bar right on beach.Easy access right across the street to restaurantsand barat LaCabana resort.Eveyone we met were so friedlymet two couples from Japan.Eagle Beach is rated one of the finest beaches in the world.Only dislikewas it was VERY busy the day we went there.
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,Eagle Beach is the most beautiful beach! Plenty of soft white sand (it's in the low-rise area and there's lots of room not crowded like other beaches); the water is clear turquoise warm and inviting. To us this is the most beautiful beach in the world!
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,Not crowded - perfect clean white sandy beach without the crowds. perfect place to just relax. The water is clear and the just the right temperature. Turtles hatch on the beach around June each year.
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,Liked the sunsets. not overly crowed but could be better taken care of was a little worried about stepping on glass did see some on beach here and there but thank goodness never had a problem with it. plastic cups and bags floating close to shore sad to see that.
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,very clean and beautiful sand and water. Cabanas available for free but you need to get there by 7 AM. They go FAST.
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,This is a great beach. Quiet and clean. We are staying at the Oceania and it is close to the bus stop to go north or south on the island. Very convient. The papalaus are usually free.
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,Water was crystal clear ocean floor soft sand- nice beach! Quiet great for couples relaxing. First chairs we rented were white plastic recliners- very uncomfortable so we switched to different ones with slats and they were better. We renter a blue beach hut and two chairs for $35 for the day
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,beautiful beach lots of people and lots to do if that is what you want nay not be the most relaxing.
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,We traveled the entire island and vistited all the popular beaches this beach by far is the most beautiful and safe. Baby beach was overcrowded and dumpy palm beach was ok too.
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,I didn't spend as much time there as I would have liked. Much less crowded than Palm Beach and the sand is whiter and prettier.
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,White sand and perfect water. It was easy to stay in the water and float away. The wind was tricky though and when on the beach the wind kicks up the sand.
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,Simply amazing and beautiful beach. Much Much better then the other beaches in Aruba.Baby beach is beautiful too but further to get to.
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,Stunning beach! Soft white Sandy beach! For the most part pretty calm with small waves! Can walk out along way before the water starts to get deep. Love love the aqua blue color of the water!
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,Loved the snorkeling there - lots of sea life and very quiet - lots of fun water sports in the area as well
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,Best beach small and not crowded yet! You won't find better beach staff anywhere on the island. LaQuinta has the best!
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,A very beautiful beach and the swimming was fantastic. Our only comment is "we've never seen so many cigarette butts"
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,Has everything rentals boats jet ski chairs.. bars resterants...everything..you could ask for...and really friendly service..
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,Beautiful beach. I literally felt like I was in one of those "Corona" commercials on TV. The sand is perfect and the water is crystal clear. I could have sat under an umbrella all day. The sunsets are absolutely gorgeous here as well.
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,Loved everything great restaurants fantastic beach friendliestpeople. Good shopping walk to everything and clean clean clean.

There are a lot of repeat visitors to Eagle Beach you can also take long walks . Water is warm and clean.
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,Eagle beach is where we have our timeshare at casa del mar for 30 tears. The surf is fantastic! Upper hotel the water is flat eagle beach has waves that you can ride and enjoy!!! Just beautiful!!!!!

g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,This is a very deep beach with lots of huts to set up your lounge chairs under. The white sand is awesome and does not get too hot in the heat of the day.
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,Very clean not crowded easy access with local bus service a great beach. There are opportunities for water sports. We enjoyed the Big Mabel tubing.
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,The beach was clean and the water was blue and crystal clear. I did think the water would be warmer but once you were in it was fine.
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,The Best in the Caribbean!!! Wide and long white powdery stretch of beach by low hotel area. It takes about an hour to walk one way from Divi Village to famous divi trees. Cristal clear very warm water . Coming back every year to enjoy it.

g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,The sand was so soft. The water so clear and turquoise. The wind was cool and kept one from getting too hot as they laid on the beach. So romantic!
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,This happens to be one of my best beaches ever to relax and have fun in the sun. Conde Nast votes this as one of the best beaches in the world I have to agree. The beach is long and so wide to walk. The water is calm and the atmosphere is always chilled here.
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,We loved our stay at the Bucuti and Tara hotel this passed week. Eagle beach is pristine. Gorgeous turquoise water. Crystal clear! Warm breeze every day. Beautiful white sand and the beaches are wide and quiet.
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,Eagle beach is close by to Palm Beach Aruba ehere the better hotels and resorts are located. Several stores are near and a shopping mall is accross the street. Most of the marine sports and atractios are located both at Eagle and Pal Beach.
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,White powdery sand. Turquoise see through water that made me feel like I was experiencing something spiritual.
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,Great Are most hotels are kid free so the beach is relatively quiet. Greta couples setting Plenty of Activity rentals But if kickback is your thing Beautiful white sand beaches to just chilax. Bar to lounge service is available or plenty of Hotel and Pier bars to get refreshments and libations.
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,the beach was clean and the sand was very soft The surrounding area is very safe and great for walking around. The water was a little cold. The weather was great except a little windy
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,The beach was so pretty and provided some great sunsets. Very windy though so expect to be sandblasted at times. No seaweed or jelly fish like the Gulf Coast of Florida.
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,Be careful there is an undertow in front of Manchebo. Families with children should consider the pool instead of the water.
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,Wonderful beach with warm water and plenty of sunshine! Fun watersports are available clean white sand and a bar for all types of beverages.
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,The beach is a great place to hang out in Aruba. Each hotel has its own area and you have to get there early to get a palapa. But its pretty and there are spots where you can snorkel. Be prepared for wind blowing sand around.
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,I like to refreshing and clear water with low waves. Playing in the ocean in the beginning of April is terrific fun. There are many places to eat lunch with logs of verity right on the beach. There is a walkway along the beach that makes for a good long walk or run in the early morning.
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,Tons of people lots of activity going on....boats jet skis parasailing jet packs jsut crazy busy!!!
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,If you go to Eagle beach rent a beach chair from the guy there who will watch your stuff while you play. The $10 per chair charge also gives you access to toilet and shower facilities at the Tulip Inn right across the road.
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,Great clean beach! Gorgeous water and sand (we saw them cleaning the sand). Nice breezes. Very relaxing. Amenities nearby.
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,Cleanclear water. Always warm. Great sunsets. There lots of people walking the beachmainly because it is so easy to walk in and you could walk all the way to Palm Beach if you wanted to!
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,Staff is very friendly and the front desk is awesome! The hotel desperately needs a general manager ... no one seems to be in charge since the previous GM moved next door to open the new RIU (old westin)
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,The water is absolutely gorgeous! The beach is very clean has easy and free access and also free parking. Nice soft sand and access to a variety of fun water activities.
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,The sand is so soft. The water is crystal clear. No seaweed jellyfish rocks or shells when we were there. It was amazing.

g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,The beach was beautiful and clean. Very relaxing. There are plenty of activities available like snorkling paddling deep sea fishing kayaking. The water temperature was perfect. It's definitely in my top 10 beautiful beaches to visit.
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,Loved the beach. From the Occidental we could walk at least 3 miles in either direction. Loved the ocean here - sandy bottom with roped off swimming area.
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,This beach is calm clean and wonderful. You will love to be there is a place where you can relax and swim as well.
g147249,d150447,February 16 2016,Beautiful long beach wide beautiful clear water. Great place to walk great for ocean swimming there are some restaurants on the beach.

g147264,d149093,February 11 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 11 2016,One or two of the many vendors are a tad pushy but just ignore them and they will leave you alone. Aside from that is a picturesque and gorgeous little beach to spend the day.
g147264,d149093,February 10 2016,By far the best Beach hands down! Fabulous white sand so clean and lots of surf!! Actually totally breathtaking!!
g147264,d149093,February 10 2016,This is a relatively small beach and not too busy. Gorgeous breakers and turquoise ocean. We had coconut cocktails on the beach and managed to haggle an excellent price. We will be back.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Back again to the Crane beach. The resort has solved the seaweed problem from last year. The beach is stunning. We spent a couple of hours hanging in the continuous waves that are refreshing and an experience. it does not get any better than this. Best beach experience at the Crane beach in my 4 years to the island.

g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Great beach even with all the seaweed on it at the moment. Make sure you slip slap slop though as its hot windy and cloudless down there.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Good for boogy-boarding although we just watched. Sun-loungers parasols and beach bar serving lunch and drinks.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,This is a beatuful beach even when there's heavy seaweed. The water is clear and warm the sand is soft as silk and the chairs and umbrellas are plentiful. We loved it.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,open to the public clean courteous change room staff. Swim with the sea turtles when the catamarans bring the cruisers in. they feed the turtles; bring your snorkle
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,This was my first trip to the Caribbean and the beach exceeded my expectations for how beautiful the tropics can be.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Steep entrance to the beach and stepping stone path over boulders. The beach was lovely clean and even had a vendor selling drinks. The sea was unbelievably blue I could have sat for hours just staring at it. Lovely place well worth a visit.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Blue water and white/pink sand. You must go. Good waves for bodysurfing/bodyboard. Few options of public parking.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,I keep coming back to this beach to enjoy the body surfing. The sand on this beach has a pink hue to it and remains my favorite beach. I have been to Bondi Beach near Sydney beaches in Maui and Hawaii beaches in California and the Panhandle of Florida but the Crane beach remains number one.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Lovely beach to relax on! What a natural beauty. Not too crowded and lovely to be able to order food from The Crane beach bar.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Beautiful beach under cliffs. Access via stairs or elevator. Lounge chairs and refreshments available. No rest rooms at beach--must go to hotel on top of cliff. Atlantic surf can be rough--swim with caution.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Juste arrived for a 17 day vacation at Crane Beach to find out that the beach is mostly covered with seaweed. Kind of ruins the experience for me. The seaweed is allo everywhere in the water I could see it fromage the airplane when we landed. I hear that the problem is not found on the est coast. So beware...
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,looking forward to the boom being approved for deployment on the rare occasions that seaweed is present.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,When we went to Crane Beach we had very high expectations. Unfortunately the weather had been very bad for days and the sea was rough and very very high and the beach covered in seaweeds. I'm sure it will look better at other times but I can't say it was one of the best beaches in Barbados.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,This is one of my all time favourite beach! The sand is beautiful and you can get sun beds on the beach. However the main factor is the waves! They are great fun and you always feel safe when the tide is coming in. :)
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Gorgeous beach with golden sand and amazing views around. Lovely cliffs surrounding the bright blue ocean. Worth a visit.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,White sand amazing waves and not too busy! Run at sunrise is just fantastic. Stayed at the Crane for 5 days and walked for a couple of miles to the other small - secret bay - whilst the water is low. Go!!!
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,One of the best beaches in the World to chill out. Great atmosphere hotel service on beach and loot overcrowded. Not a swimmers beach as it is more for those who like to body surf or jump up/down in waves.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,The view was just beautiful the weather awesome and the people very friendly. The water was rough at times but the beach was quiet to sleep.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,As large as the property it was never over crowded and the water and sand very clean. many area for beach chairs and family to stay together.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,The most beautiful beach. Only disadvantage lift to the beach seems to be inoperable a lot of the time had elderly parents with us so unfortunately could not access beach.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Considering this is suppossed to one of the fourth best beaches in the worldwe were dissappointed by what we saw when going down onto the beach.Yes it was clean and large but i prefered the beach which our hotel fronted in the Almond Beach Resort.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,The seaweed has turned this delightful beach into an unattractive one. People were coming down ready to set themselves up on the beach looking at the seaweed strewn beach and going away.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Just a lovely setting with a beautiful blue sea. Sun beds available. Need to be staying in the area. We visited from St James and it was about a 40min drive
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,love the beach but waves are rough; great for body surfing. Water if blue but if you are looking to relax in the water this is not the place for you. There are plenty of chairs/umbrellas with beach service. Due to the rough waves there are no water sport activities.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Fantastic beach nice clear white sand but be very careful if going into the sea it can be very strong waves. Nice little walk a def must. Found staff very friendly
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,excellent beach not very long for walks the surf was rough and we enjoyed watching the brave cliff jumpers.....beach service was excellent.... cold beer and bbq on the beach...
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,The beach was never over crowded and the staff was excellent. The water is crystal clear but the waves could be a little rough. Overall it was great.

g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Iconic beach with beautiful pink sand. Best viewed from Azzure at the Crane enjoying dinner and a cocktail.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Good for sunbathing and long walks. Not a a great place to swim unless you are a good swimmer. Great view and good photo op.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,The most beautiful beach I have ever seen! The sea has an incredible color! It's not the most calm ocean and a little bit far from others beahces but it will not bother you and totally worth it!
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Beach cleanup from the incoming seaweed should be a priority. More must be done around the entire island to clean up the dead seaweed debris and making it usable.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,the crane elevator made it much easier to get to than in the old days. but that is the beauty of the experience if everyone went there it wouldn't be as special.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,The staff are friendly the lounge chairs are cushy and the rum drinks are cool and refreshing. What more could you ask for? The water is a bit rough on that side of the island. I am not a big swimmer so I was okay with just laying there enjoying the view.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,It was suffering from a lot of sea moss but beautiful and pink and the service was exceptional. Free beach chairs! And loved the towel card idea. Always a fresh towel.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,I visited this beach last January visiting family nearby. On a nice day this beach is gorgeous! The waters are a stunning aqua blue and the sand super soft. There is even a small cliff from which you can jump into the water and plenty of waves.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Numerous pools/spa/fitness club restaurant beach access by elevator historical site all inclusive village good Consierge service. Needs more crop event activities.

g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Excellent employees great food and the best beach in the world. They have several pool areas and the gardening around the resort is great with a lot of attention to details.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Pan handlers selling items on the beach were a bit pushy. Some guy sells alcoholic beverages but not a member of Crane staff. Rip off prices and not a good drink. The current is quite dangerous on this beach. I would suggest you drive to the west of the island to safer beaches (St Lawrence Gap perhaps)
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,It's a good place to blob. Careful if you're not a good swimmer. The lifeguards I'm not confident about.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Pink sand in a private cove that you can only get to by stairs or an elevator! Crystal blue water prestine beach. Great drinks provided at the beach bar brought right to your lounge chairs. Very relaxing.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Stunning Beach with moderate to tough waves!!! Awesome views and great beach with stunning water!!

g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,I loved the powdery white sand on this beach. The waves were pretty rough but it was lots of fun. There are lots of lounge chairs with large umbrellas for shade. Great spot to relax or get in the action of the waves. Your choice!
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Pink coral sand soft as a pillow. Roughish waves kinda fun. Clean always available seats. Sometimes the elevator is broken :(
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,A beautiful beach just an elevator ride down the cliff from the Crane resort. Deck chair hire from the Crane staff is very expensive however other operators rent far cheaper. The Resort Restaurants send staff down to take your orders for both drink and food. The Beach is imaculate and safe however the Water can have a very strong current.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,We never stayed at the crane but did make a few hour visit when driving our rented car around this safe island. It's quite beautiful well designed very quiet and has beautiful pools. The elevator ride to the beach is different too. We never did it but we did relax at the pools and had drinks at the enclosed bar.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,

g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,The Crane Beach was so beautiful. I would not take young kids as it was a bit too rough but it is great for adults.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,This is a stunning white sand beach wedged between two cliffs. We rented chairs for 10$USD including the umbrella. The sea is rough I would recommend a visit in the morning as the beach is facing east - we stayed from 10:30 to 1pm. It is truly worth a visit.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,One of the nicest beaches in the Caribbean in my opinion. Majestic cliffs fine white sand nice water color and waves.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Beautiful beach as every beach in Barbados! This one is supposed to beach one of the best in Barbados - according to its citizens. I loved it it was awesome you can swim relax have a picnic... And as always enjoy the stunning colours!
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,The Crain is one of the most beautiful beaches I`ve ever seen! Crystal blue waters and also a Cliff where you can dive.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Lovely popular beach too many people for me prefer the more secluded beaches in Barbados. All in all a lovely beach with friendly locals selling drinks.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Don't leave Barbados without experiencing this....it has been voted one of the top ten beaches in the world...and from the restaurant on the top sipping a chilled glass of rosé eating lobster salad it certainly lives up to its name. Body surfing the waves with everyone from aged 8 to 75 is simply the best
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Beautiful beach with white sand and big waves coming from the sea. Visited only for a while but will surely get back when visiting Barbados next time.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Gorgeous beach. Accessible from a steep muddy road or through the grounds of the Crane Resort. The gatekeeper at the resort appeared not to want to let us in but we sucked up big time. The beach can then be accessed by elevator which is adjacent to the L'Azure restaurant. Beautiful pinkish sand but big waves and reputable strong undercurrents
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Absolutely wonderful! This beach was the best beach I've seen except for Bora Bora. I recommend this place highly!
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,This beach is absolutely beautiful! The remarkably pure white sand several different shades of blue and rocky features make it a great spot to admire the beauty of nature. Great for pictures!! Not only that the waves were really fun to play in. They were huge! Just be careful if you have small children
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Expensive sun loungers and pushy drinks sellers made this a beach we won't return to. Try bottom bay if you're willing not to swim (undercurrents) or Miami beach
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,This beach has strong undertows making it less safe for small children to enjoy. Also getting to the beach is hard. It's a very long way down from The Crane hotel and the elevator didn't work for us. If you drive via the public access there is very limited (no parking) on the cliff road. More hassle than it's worth.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,This spot is great to eat at (the restaurant at Crane) and then you can go down to the beach and body surf or Boogie board until you are exhausted. You can negotiate with the locals for some chairs and boards - negotiate hard and you will get a good price.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Very nice beach with good service if you stay at the resort. Nice sand that is just right and great waves boogie boarding or body surfing..
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,World class beach breathtaking waves cooling breeze.not suitable for children. Visit the hotel for lunch- 10/10
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,This beach is powdery sand with beautiful waters. The waves are tough here so wouldn't advise for small children. One of the few places in Barbados to look down from a cliff to the beach.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Pleasant to walk around or have a meal in one of the bars or restaurants. Some shops too Great sea view from cliff edge go on a sunny day to enjoy at its best. Can look a bit deserted.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Soft pink sands turquoise seas. Just beautiful. Don't buy coconuts on the beach as they're a rip off.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,There was a bar right on the beach as well as a fresh water shower to rinse off before ascending the cliff. There is quite a strong current so weak swimmers should be cautious.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Incredible. One of the most beautiful beaches I have ever seen. Supposedly rated frequently as one of the top ten beaches world wide and you can see why! Its located close to the airport and its well worth the trip for a beach day! Check out the beautiful Crane Beach Resort if you get a chance too!
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,One of the top ten beaches in the world. Just relax and enjoy. Incredible soft sand. Explore the Crane resort as well - very beautiful.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Crane beach and the Crane Resort are simply stunning. We wished we could have stayed a night at the Crane. We spent a day there and enjoyed lunch at the Carriage house restaurant enjoyed the pool and then headed to the beach for some fun in the sun!
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Surf is quite rough and the water is not suitable for swimming or for young inexperienced swimmers. The beach is not very long although it is wide. There are loungers and umbrellas available. It is picturesque with cliffs surrounding the beach. The beach is accessible from the Crane Hotel by stairs or by elevator.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,I ordered rack of lamb as I have done in many a Greek restaurant but received four lamb chops which were tough. Service was slow. The manageress of the restaurant tried to cheer me up even though I did not complain. Very astute.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Fun swimming in the huge waves. Great photo op as well. Took the bus and it was a fun trip. A must see while in Barbados.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,The crane beach is just amazing with beautiful pink sand.Its not crowded and theres loads of sunbeds.We stayed @ The Crane &the view of the beach from the main pool is breathtaking & its just perfect.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,We didn't stay here but visited the resort... just wow.... if you can afford it ...what a view and what a gorgeous place...
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Lovely white/pink sand with tiny shells. Good length to walk for some early morning exercise then a nice swim in the seam but be cautious as the sea can be quite rough and there is a strong current at times.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Absolutely loved the pink sand but was very cautious of what I considered rough water with regular undercurrents.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,The beach is pristine lots of chairs umbrellas and room. The ocean is a bit angry but makes for good fun surfing the waves. It's a beautiful location worth the visit.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Loved this beach. very quite. Water was a little rough but any beach on this side of island east will be rougher.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Beautiful sand and the beach was not packed during October. Waves are a little rougher on this side of the island so it's great for body boarding but not great for a calm swim.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Beautiful...... cud not of asked for a better day. Easily the best beach in barbados. Careful in the water tho as strong waves
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Crane Beach is really beautiful with soft pinkish sand and turquoise water. The waves can get a bit big for swimming but also great just to stand in the water and let the waves splash you.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Pink sand great people great views.. Waves were a little bit rough for me. Great rum punch on beach.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,You have to experience it. It's perfect. I would build my house in this bay and would be happy forever. Oh and don't forget to get one of the lush coconut drinks that the guys sell there - served in the actual coconut. Paradise.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,A great semi-private beach next to the Crane Resort. During low-tide the beach is pretty wide and the water is very warm.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,What is not to love about this beach. White sand crystal blue waters hot sun cool breeze and for the adventure seekers a chance to try some Clift diving :)
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Definitely one of the most spectacular beaches in the world and absolute must-visit on every visit to Barbados.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,-Beautiful beach! A must see! -amazing sand....it's pink due to the tiny pink coral fragments mixed with the white sand

g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Bit of a pain to drive there but worth the trip. Pink sand warm sea and decent waves. Best get to it via the Crane complex as there is a lift but out of order when we went had to use the steps. Went on a day when hardly anyone there. Beds and umbrella's available to rent.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Gorgeous beach. A must do trip. The sea was a bit rough when we went but on a calm day the water is crystal clear.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,This place is like a paradise...it's worth the detour...the waves are strong but perfect for a good thrill...a must in barbados
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Crane beach is one of my favorite beaches in Barbados. The beach is beautiful and long. Suitable for walking and relaxation. The waves were big and strong. Sometimes swimming there is impossible. But Crane beach is very nice for photo session. I recommend visit the beach!
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Although it was tricky to access Crane beach is beautiful. The waves are very strong as is the undertow so care should be taken.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Pink sand turquoise sea no crowds fantastic waves no one hassling chairs and umbrellas complimentary
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,I visited the Crane Resort on the insistence of my friend and I was so glad that I did. Firstly the view from the L'Azure was absolutely breathtaking. The meal was good. Service was exceptional The waitress was polite and very helpful. Definitely warrants a return visit. Breathtaking.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,The water is warm and soothing. The waters are a little rough but it still makes it an enjoyable day at the beach.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Absolutely gorgeous. If you are a Crane resident you can use the sun beds which make a big difference. Big waves to play in but there are some strong currents. A great bar located behind the beach too with awesome food.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,A world class beach on the south east coast of Barbados facing the Altantic Ocean.White sands and dramatic waves are overlooked by an elegant resort built into the cliffside. Isolated wilderness and luxury combine well here...
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Lovely pink sands but scary jelly fish. Many Portoguses Man O War jelly fish washed up on sands. These can give a very bad sting. Waves are high so not great for swimming.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Having stayed on the St James coast it was a fantastic experience to visit the opposite coast line. The sea is so different with large typhoon lagoon type waves - well worth a day trip
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Near the Crane hotel this beach has umbrellas and chairs for rent but access can be tricky. Also take note that the ocean here can be quite rough.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Try to get there in a sunny day. You can take nice pictures. There is a path going to the north in order to reach the beach. Take a look at Google maps first. You can drive without get into the hotel.There is a small street that you can park and walk over some wet stones at low tide.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Wonderful pink sand quiet brilliant for strong swimmers or stroll in the surf for those not so good - beware of strong current and undertow. Lying back and listening to the breaking waves is heavenly.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Stunning beach and strong sea waves - good for surfing or bodysurf No much else is going on around apart if you are stayng at the club which is like a village - all amenities ar there
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,lovely clean beach although quite small but lots of people swimming board surfing and jumping of point
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Loved spending the day at Crane Beach great service from the staff beautiful scenery and a lovely breeze coming off the ocean.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,This is THE beach one sees in the travel brochure. Pink coral tinted fine sand. Accessed by public stairs or through The Crane Resort this is one of the finest beaches in the world.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Although all beaches in Barbados are public Crane beach because of its location tends to be used mainly by hotel guests and nearby residents. Weak swimmers should not venture too far into the sea however as the waves are sometimes quite boisterous.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Beautiful white sand crystal clear water and amazing opportunities for pictures and family fun! Also an added bonus is that Cutter's Deli will deliver their fabulous lunches along with Rum Punch Directly to the beach!!!
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Beach is wonderful ocean is quite rough and difficult to stand up in but fun when the waves throw you back.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,This was most incredible and beautiful beach and ocean-view. The color of the water..the aqua-teal Carribean blue white sand and beautiful sunny days.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,We stayed in the South Coast but went to The Crane for lunch which allowed us acces via the hotel to the beach. The day we went it was extremely windy which made it feel quite cool. It was worth it though as this beach is beautiful and has very high surf. Would definitely recommend a visit.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,We were recommended to go to crane beach and wow what a great recommendation the beach is amazing so clean and such beautiful clear water. We can highly recommend a visit.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Came only for a few ours because i was cruising but it was worth it and truly is one of the most beatiful beaches in the world crystal blue water and white sand are and excellent combination pluss hotel services (with an extra fee and wifi too) in general a place that is a MUST in Barbados
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Great Beach: very clean/ was never over crowded/ amazing views But: tides can be a bit rough especially for children
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,This beach is amazing. But there was a red flag up the entire time we were there. The surf was high and the tide was very strong. Great for sunbathing but I recommend caution for anyone venturing into the water.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,A gorgeous beach that was voted one of the best in the World. Unfortunately probably due to this positive publicity it is now pretty crowded and not somewhere I would choose to go to relax.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,The beach is rated one of the best in the world. As an inveterate beach-goer it's definitely up there with Malindi Hermanus Hilton Head and ALL the beaches in Mozambiue. But the people make this place -- as does the tennis.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Crane Beach is a very large beach. The sand is beautiful! The views are amazing! Love this beach. Very secluded.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,We always visit Crane Beach when we visit Barbados and if you go you must access the beach down the lane and across the stepping stones. They have improved them now so it is easy. You must also take the lift the the Crane Hotel Shopping Village and walk around the hotel have a drink and sample the fabulous cakes
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,There is a private access from The Crane resort via a lift or a public access further down the road. You can rent sunbeds and umbrellas and they sell drinks along the beach. The Atlantic ocean does get a bit choppy so be careful. There is a lovely breaze on the east coast. Dont forget your sunlotion
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,A lovely big beach...not too crowded and easy to find. The sand has a lovely pinkish hue and the sea is crystal clear and warm. Beach beds are easy to hire and there is opportunity for food either at the Crane Hotel of delivered picnic style from Cutters of Babados.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,The crane beach is not easy to access unless you go through the Crane Beach Hotel. The beach itself is lovely but it is not the most beautiful one in Barbados.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Crane beach has the finest sand imaginable pink tinged and talcum powder soft. Sunbeds available for hire. We had lunch in the carriage house at the Crane hotel it was the best lunch best service and best value we had in our entire 2 month visit to this beautiful island.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,

g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,The view was as beautiful as I pictured. Though the water was a bit rough it was quite inviting especially when I ventured to the rock on the eastern side. Great cliff diving spot.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Fun waves wonderful silky sands. Friendly beach bar tucked away in the dunes. BUT overpowered by hotel that appeared to have suffered lots of extensions. Approach over concrete stepping stones that waves were making wet and slippery not the easiest. Parking facilities poor. Have been recommended to continue a little further South to Foul Bay.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Whilst just past the full force of the atlantic coast the waves at Crane beach are still active enough for some fun boogie boarding. With an interesting hop across some stepping stones across the rocks this beach is not disabled friendly but hey there are plenty of others. Beach side amenities are adequate and there are beachside sellers of refreshments.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,they tried hard to get rid of the seagras but had to deposit it at the beach (smell). they provide normally an elevator which was out of order but never mind the fiew staires.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,One of the best beaches on the islandwith a bar and grill within easy reach for lunchthe surf here can be a bit strong but it's certainly fun for all you wake boarders.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Beautiful and fun to play in the waves (not so sure I'd take kids there though..!) Beach bar was great and the guys came around to offer us drinks from time to time.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Crane beach is one of the best beaches on the island. It has nice waves for body surfing and excellent breeze.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Fantastic beach bit choppy but really great views. Dont buy the coconut cocktails they may be special but trying to charge us $10 US each is a real rip-off!
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,

g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,When you first see this beach you will say ' Wow ! ' It's everything a beach should be. White soft sand. Beach is wide and flat as a pancake perfect for beach cricket. Clear blue waters. All it needs is a propper beach bar !
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Crane beach is absolutely lovely please visit you will not regret it!! Lovely warm sea and soft sand. Cracking ;)

g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,the beach is totally clean and water is at the perfect temperature. It is not a beach for small children though it has big waves
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Can't understand why it's supposed to be one of the top ten beaches in the world. Haven't they seen the Maldives Sri Lanka Kenya Costa Rica etc? And you have to pay to go on the beach. The beach next door Foul Bay is free and free of people. It's called foul because the ship anchorage is not very good.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Great beach I was amazed to find that very people were at the beach very relaxing. Great views water is of an amazing blue color sand is very fine. One of the best beaches on the island.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,After a late lunch at The Atlantis we drove to Crane Beach. Walking down to the beach is an adventure over the stone pathway. Once there it is worth the effort a lovely beach to walk along barefoot in the surf.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Absolutely stunning beach fun swimming and great proximity to crane resort facilities make this a must visit. Really fun jump off the cliff is possible and has everything needed for a great day.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,great beach private low keyed and relaxing; can get drinks right there as well. One of the best views on the island. mostly used by Crane Resort guests.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,The crane beach is spectacular beautiful pink sands and azure blue water! If you are lucky you will be able to watch turtles swimming close by. A lift takes the strain out of the walk back up the cliff wonderful way to pass a relaxing day.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,White sand crashing surf really beautiful beach. Not the calm Caribbean sea but wow! Loungers available easy access from the road or via The Crane
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,they sell good coconut drinks- however once they offer green and white it got weird!!! We like to have fun- not be stupid.. Top beach on my list
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,This beach is wonderful! The waves are great to play in and there is always a perfect breeze... not to windy and not stifling hot! There are always lots of loungers with umbrella's available whenever I've been there. We go to this location every year and it's always been an excellent experience! I would recommend this resort to anyone.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,The beach is beautiful and clean. You won't get too much swimming in since it is fairly rough. Don't arrive hungry - no food is available!
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Crane Beach is my favorite beach in Barbados! The water is bright blue there are good waves to swim in and beautiful white sand. Walk away from the Crane past the road/driveway to the beach for a totally deserted area.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Gorgeous pink sand beach. Very picturesque location. Clear blue water fairly calm. There is a neat little walk at the far end of the beach up a few steps that lets you look out right over the sea. Don't miss it if you are on Barbados!
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,

g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,One of the many great beach on the southeast coast the Crane will blow your mind. It is a PERFECT beach. Great waves cliff diving the Crane has it all!!!
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Great beach great waves. Relatively isolated with facilities at the Crane hotel. You can walk to a connecting beach to the east that is almost always deserted.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Another beautiful beach with stunning pink sand great waves for fooling around in and a cliff for the boys to jump from down side no wash room facilitys or refreshment take along a picnic.

g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Picturesque beach with nice small waves. There are some people trying to sell you stuff but they aren't too aggressive. Take photos!
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Fabulous - expensive but worth it!! Service is a little slow but it is worth the wait! The cocktails are great too!!
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Pink and big with just the right amount of waves. Loved being able to walk down the beach and explore the cliffs and caves. Quiet but has food and drink service. You really need to stay at the Crane to go to this beach otherwise it is hard to get to.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,We returned to the Crane Beach resort in December 2011 with friends & family to see the gospel choir on a Sunday morning! We enjoyed a great breakfast & the festive gospel choir. Afterwards we spent the day on the beach and enjoyed the waves of the East Coast. Well worth a visit!
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,We went back here multiple times this was one of our favorite beaches and spots on the island. The locals selling coconuts with rum was yummy and enjoyable. The cliff walk along the ledge is beautiful we walked it and took so many photos. The beach is amazing.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Lots of white sand. They rent loungers if you are interested. Good for pictures. We didn't swim however it was a good place to swim as we saw lots of people in the water. Wished I had on my swim suit!
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Great service. Stayed fro 7 days in a unit with its own magical garden pool jacuzzi gazebo. A little home away from home.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,The towel and drink service was the best part! And also watching people jump off the cliff! The beach is private so this was also a plus!
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,When we were in Italy a few years ago at the Lido in Venice the beach was beautifully looked after. Such a shame that the Crane Breach is not looked after at all
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Beach is absolutely stunning! Little debris easy to get in an dout. Definitely try a coconut drink from Ray Ray.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,What a lovely beach so clean! and the sand really is pink! The sea was much clearer than i had expected and lovely and blue! However be careful when swimming as there is a very strong current here! Great lift to take you down to the beachA beach not to miss out on!
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,

g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,dramatic view from the hotel above access by elevator! Fantastic powder white sand beach with a good surf for body surfing or boogie boards.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Everyone talks about the Crane Beach. Well the Crane it self is lovely and the restaurants are great. I love the local vendors that come to sell their wares it isn't like Oistins or the Gap it's done very tastefully. Oh back to the beach. Whenever I was there I found the beach to be rough and lots of seaweed.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Beautiful to take pictures! water is nice beware this beach has waves. Its worth a visit.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,The beach provided a couple of hours great fun messing about in the big waves. The beach is split in two informally - comfortable and clean for The Crane Resort whilst the other half is less clean and full of beached seaweed which attracts a lot of flies. Still worth a trip though.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Wasn't crowded sand is soft and pink colour there were waves just big enough for body-surfing.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,

g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,You have to see this beach to truly appreciate it. the water can be a little rough but the setting is spectacular. Stroll the white sand and let the sun revive you.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,if you go on sundays you can have the wonderful breakfast withe the gospel chorus. Great beach very luxurious.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Worth a visit beautiful blue water and a fantastic place to just chill
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Rated amongst the most beautiful in the world the beautiful pink sand and cliff backdrop make this a truly beautiful place. Getting a little too busy for my taste nowadays. Shallow beach with extremely powerful breakers great for boogie boarding.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,The Sunday lunch was amazing and the Crane Hotel. The view from the restaurant brought tears to my eyes. One of the 10 best beaches in the world. White sand azure seas fabulous facility to stay at. Every year we visit Barbados and every year we visit Crane Beach
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,This is a wonderful beach and the complex has been well developed . . but it's not really related to Barbados - it could be anywhere. It would be a shame to be stuck here for the duration of your stay - you'd miss the joys of the island
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Biased because I live 2 minutes away but the sand is unmatched on the island pink and white hues and powdery soft. The ocean itself provides a bit of a challenge because the beach is on the atlantic side and exploration will uncover many sea caves in the cliffsides .
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Pay around $30 Bajan to go through the hotel. This is redeemable at the cafe and also the beach bar for drinks but not sunbeds. There is a lift to the beach. Stunning beach but quite rough so paddling is best.

g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,A bit secluded with a good path down to the beach. Part of the Crane resort but not too many people. Umbrellas and chairs made available. Bring your own cooler. No under tow. Medium waves.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,The beach is excellent if you want to sun bathe then it's a great spot swimming is a no no water is too rough with lots of under currents and waves crashing hard the view from above is fantastic.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Great beach right beside Crane Resort and Village. Absolutely great sand (like flour) a little rough sea but still a great swim. Rated top 10 in the world don't miss the opportunity!
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,I would highly recommend visiting Crane Beach on your trip to Barbados. The secluded location beautiful cliffs and great waves made it a really fun spot to spend the day. Given the rougher waves it might not be an ideal spot to bring young children unless you've got access to the swimming pools at the resort adjacent to the beach.

g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Beautiful pink sand beach nice waves for surfing and boogie boarding. More quiet than the west coast which is great!
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Crane beach is stunning with palm tree fringed sands rolling surf and clear blue water. It can be accessed either from The Crane Resort cliff lift or stairs or by steps at the far end and then scrambling over some rocks but well worth the effort ! One of the most beautiful beaches in Barbados !
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,My spouse loves this spot...........the japanese food was ridiculously expensive and I left hungry............poor service..........to boot. imagine training going on in high season?
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,We did not stay at Crane Beach Hotel but would do so next time. The beach is absolutely beautiful and the restaurant was great. I had salad and could not have wished for more. Beautifully presented and tasted fabulous.The wine was world class.

g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Amazing beach great little bar and great coconut drinks. The water is very ruff...so if u like waves this is the place to be....and make sure you take a stroll up and down the cliff wonderful views
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,We stopped in for a bite and a swim but were surprised by the amount of sargassum sea weed on the beach. Between the smells and the fact that it was in the water the swim was called off. Crane staff was working to clear it and I hope it is gone before long
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,This is a beautiful beach tucked under the Crane Resort. Being on the East (Atlantic) coast the waves are strong and plentiful providing lots of fun while in the water. The first one hit me like an uppercut to the jaw. The last one which I tried to ride in threw me to the bottom. It was awesome!
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Even if you aren't a guest of the Crane Resort you can get public access to this beach and I suggest you not miss it. There is a little tiki bar there and it has the best Maui Maui I've ever had. Also the locals make you rum drinks in real coconuts.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,You have to be careful when swimming but its worth it. beautiful white sand and very natural. Has a good beach bar and grill and other facilities.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,An absolutely beautiful east coast beach however  not a safe place to swim. Access if with many stairs down to beach and once there not a lot of amenities. Finally the east coast is very rugged and not over populated . If you stay in that area  it's a long way to anywhere. Not for us.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Never stayed here but visited the beautiful clean beach. Great swimming snorkelling or just relaxing
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Stunning beach - fantastic colours - worth a stop just to take a look and feel the soft sand between toes. Appart from one fisherman (fishing from the beach) we were the only ones on the beach that morning - very beautiful and worth a photo stop
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Absolutely loved this beach - ledges and rocks to climb a cavern to explore long shoreline warm water not very crowded plus PINK sand. Definitely worth a visit!!! Can't wait to go back :o)

Lots of love to Tallman And Drew Day MARSHALL!!Respeck I'ya!!! These big men work hard and ALWAYS have your back when you require it makin sure your vacation is perfect

g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,My wife and I visited the Crane in 2005 via RCI (a Timeshare exchange Company). At the time this only had one eatery.The staff were friendly and helpful.The rooms are something else. See picture. The beach from the terrace was to my mind great forget the sunbeds on the beach the ones around the pool will do.

g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,What a great day spent at an awesome beach. Water is very ruff high and strong waves. Be aware that there are some guys that try to sell you coco water and other stuff. A bit annoying. but the views WOW!!
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Wonderful pink sand beach considered one of the best of the world by USA Today readers. Very suitable for couples looking for a romantic spot.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,What a beautiful beach but very hard to find it looks like you are driving down someone's driveway you can get food and drink.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Not as amazing as the reviews. Even despite the seaweed. Don't get the hype. May not return since the other beaches are just as good if not better.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,The beach is stunning and feels so secluded. There's a small cliff that is safe and easy to jump off of. However the beach is basically run by vendors. If you don't want to be bothered by them stay closer to the far right side of the beach. Overall definitely a must-see when in Barbados!
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,We were just here in June and the seaweed was under control. We stayed at the resort but went to investigate the public access. If you are not staying at the resort: the public access could be treacherous. The beach is worth it!

g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Another fabulous stay at the Crane. Seaweed still a problem but that's nature and shuttle to Copacabana worth it as lovely beach there and chance to walk into Bridgetown along the beach for free! Nice to see lovely staff again Susan at the Carriage bar and Errol in L'azure also Watson hive of information really made our trip.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Quiet relaxed all the services you need and none that bother you. Water is fine best for swimming - sandy bottom few if any rocks. We stayed at the Crane so were there every day.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,This is a beautiful beach at a wonderful old now renovated hotel on the Atlantic side of Barbados.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,My husband and I were able to walk the length of this beach one morning and we had the entire beach to ourselves. The white sand was beautiful although marred by the presence of the sea weed (However the seaweed is seasonal)
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Being that the beach is on the Eastern side of the island the caribbean beaches have suffered because of the Seagrass invasion so please don't hold the Hotel at fault for this occurance. Crane tries their best daily to clean up the seagrass but no one can stop nature.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Wonderful breezes from the Atlantic Ocean - the beach is kept immaculate and compliments the wonderful Crane Hotel.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Beautiful water seaweed needed cleaned up a little. Elevator down to the beach was pretty fun- never seen that before.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Beautiful beach and fantastic service. We had a minor issue with seaweed but the team were working tirelessly to remove and return to normal appearance.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Mother nature saw fit to bless us with abundant amounts of sea weed. Unfortunately we didn't appreciate the gift. The Crane staff tried to keep the beach clear working each day to rake and clear it but ti was just a lot more than they could keep up with.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Stunning beach amazing hotel with ocean view and a plunge pool. staff were very pleasant and the food was amazing. you can't go wrong with any restaurant their love all their fish dishes.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Great scenery clean great people. More calm than the other beaches in Barbados. Make sure you get a coconut!
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,I am not sure if it was my expectations but I was very disappointed. They did have a seaweed problem but I still would have been let down. Carlisle Bay had more pink sand than here. We only stayed for an hour or so then moved to Paynes Bay.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,The beach is beautiful with strong breezes pink sand & carved cliffs. Yes it does have some seaweed issues but The Crane Resort has a crew of men and a mini machine to clear the beach everyday. Beach is also nice for hiking around the coast.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,A little rough for swimming but really good surf. Lots of undertow lost my new sunglasses in a rogue wave that took me under but thoroughly enjoyed it. Try the beach grill - great lunch by all in our group
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,We had the pleasure of visiting this beach in March. It is a beautiful beach unfortunately it had alot of seaweed after the first two day. But still it is beautiful. Couldn't go out in the water because of the seaweed. Towel service was great. And the bar/snack shop was good. And convenient.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Nice beach if you like beaches but a tad windy and seem to have a seaweed problem. The sea also looked a bit choppy for swimming although some people did.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Seaweed growth is a major problem. Elevator leading to beach broken. Towel service could have been better and more options as to beach chairs. I like th fact that Cutters delivers to the beach.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Stopped here as one list indicated it #23 on top 100 beaches in world. The Crane property above is spectacular and the road access has these great round pavers across the craggy rocks to get onto the beach. You can definitely see the pink grains of sand on this beach.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Nice beach however you have to bring your own cooler with drinks as the beach bar is very limited. Sea is rough so surfing the waves is a must. For the really crazy jumping of the cliff edge is a must.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,very big waves and lots of seaweed on the beach all beaches are public in barbados so expect to see some locals
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,The Crane beach turns into the Giant Landfill. Seaweed everywhere. The rotten eggs smell. No swimming. Nobody cleaning. Rental owners hide information about the Crane beach condition and charge high rental prices. We waste our vacations.

g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Trouble with seaweed. 12 feet high on the beach. Clean up consists of 8 guys with 4 wheelbarrows moving from one side of the beach to the other. No removal. Stinks..
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,If you get chance you should visit this stretch of beach. It does have public access if you look hard enough!! If you are even luckier you will be greeted with the opportunity to buy a really strong cocktail in a coconut husk.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Heard so many good things about this location but when we visited the surf was up too dangerous to enter the water and there was seaweed everywhere. Definitely not enticing so we left and had a beer at a little bar up the street.
g147264,d149093,February 9 2016,Very private beach for residents of the Crane. Nice beach lounge chairs and umbrellas. Attentive staff to bring you rum punch.
g147293,d215733,March 12 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 12 2016,The beach off of the Royalton was very nice even though it was full of people. You could walk for hours either direction. The sand is clean and very soft.
g147293,d215733,March 12 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 12 2016,Variety of chairs and beds. Great beach with options for sun or shade time! Everyone loved our beach time!
g147293,d215733,March 12 2016,Just picture-perfect! The palms the sea (some sea weed yes - but hey it's natural!) the sand (so fine! recommend not to drop your iphone into the sand... twice) the breeze... An amazing place.
g147293,d215733,March 11 2016,Beautiful beach! The multi colored water and clean sands were breathtaking! It was beyond what I had imagined.
g147293,d215733,March 11 2016,This beach is beautiful but in recent years the beach is being washed away and has become so narrow. Currently there is a little bit of a problem with seaweed
g147293,d215733,March 11 2016,Friendly people a ton of restaurants to keep you away from cheesy resorts. Walk the beach for a day and you'll have minor harassment and you'll meet tons of cool people from around the world who know this is the place!
g147293,d215733,March 11 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 11 2016,The sunrises at the beach was breath taking the beaches were clean. Loved the option of either relaxing on the beach or at the poolside.
g147293,d215733,March 10 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,Our resort was right on this fantastic stretch of white sand. The sand is so soft and you can walk for miles. The surf can be rough but also fun. No weeds or rocks just soft white sand and blue green water
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,Our resort shared what looked to be about the same beach! this place is paradise and so much fun sun and relaxation!!!
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,Beautiful breathtaking beach white sand turquoise water cool breeze :) one of my favourite beaches in the world!! Water sports if you want it or just simply sit down & enjoy the view!!!
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,I'm pretty sure this waster beach and it was great. I highly recommend staying in the Royal Service portion with the Paradisus because its more spacious otherwise it looked a bit crowded. Great for walking up and down the beach with friendly but not aggressive beach walkers selling things.
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,Safe Excellent Amazing Sunsets Dominican People are honest hard working and made our stay the best ever!
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,Breath taking view great for just chilling with a book or watching the sunset long walks on the beach
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,Really happy with this beach. Heard lots of great things and wasn't disappointed. Haven't met nicer folks than in the Dominican. So helpful friendly and genuine
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,BEAUTIFUL BEACH ! turquoise water warm water white sand everything was clean !!! the locals can not pass a certain line so you do not have them in your face trying to sell you things
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,Beautiful beach under the palm trees. The ocean is clean great for snorckeling and diving. the sand is clean fine and white
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,We were staying at memories splash resort. This beach is a complex of warm water cold drinks coconut trees and white sand. What else could you ask for while laying in shades as you stare upon these beautiful trees that have grown out infertile sands creates amazing atmosphere you could only dream of back home in Toronto.
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,We just saw the place nearby not the beach. It was a nice shopping area. Mall shopping centers American food
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,Very good experience definitively I want to go againg its amazing and clear beach I like so much Dominican Republic is amazing
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,Beautiful beach with lovely coastal views. I have never felt such powdery sand before Great beach for families and plenty of watersports.
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,Sargassum seaweed took over at the rate of 1 ft. per day. Impossible to swim. Mass seaweed removal is needed.
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,Bavarian beaches considered one of the best in the world but I think sometimes need cleaning plastic bottles that had many ....
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,Gawjuss! Loved it! The sea really is that colour! Plenty to do if you want or just chill out. Perfect!
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,Visited amidst a hurricane watch/warning. Lots of seaweed and ocean debris all along the ocean line. Skin became itching and very sore after swimming. We walked along the the beach quite extensively it is dirty and not tended to and some areas are desolate. Not recommended to walk at night - no lighting. Saw very limited security/police presence.
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,The water was very calm and clear. The only concern was the seaweed. They clean it up every day. There were plenty of chairs and plenty of wait staff... very serene
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,Great beach with white sand extremely well kept and clean. The water was warm just the way I like it!
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,I love the beach no shells or rocksyou just walk right in...no sinking sand either...the big minus is the seaweed.
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,Very beautiful! Lots of fun all types of water sports from scuba diving to parasailing a very clean and inviting beach with plenty of beach chairs.
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,The beach is beautiful. The water was nice and warm. BUT they have a seaweed was a little over powering in spots.
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,Sandy beach with nice water but SEAWEED!!!! I hope the government of D.R do something about it!!!! SEAWEED everywhere so we didn't go in the beach as much.
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,Bavaro beach is lovely. Unfortunately there is a lot of seaweed most days. The further south you go on bavaro beach it get smaller and smaller as they have had diggers in to remove seaweed and it is not a good sight. People staying in the royal suites grand palladium have virtually no beach at all
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,The beach is fine (long with coco trees and nice sand) but you need to be lucky to avoid the seaweed season.
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,White sand Crystal clear calm sea great place to unwind and choice of food all in once place. good entertainment through the day and evening
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,This beach was a few paces from our hotel. Clean cute huts water was incredible. I recommend saving a few pieces of bread from your meals to feed the fish.
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,Went to Bavaro Beach for a 50th Birthday for a Family member. 11 of went we had an excellent time.. The men golfed a couple of times while the ladies enjoyed their time on the beach. Food was amazing!! Beach was Perfect!! Would def recommend this resort.. We didn't want to leave..
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,Wonderful sandy beaches lovely warm sea excellent facilities  take time out to have a walk along the beach. Get up early and watch the sun rise.
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,Nice beach. Choppy at times and lots of seaweed but overall very nice. No vendors randomly walking through which is nice.
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,It's ok nothing really special especially with the seaweed problem that's going on right now in the Caribbean.
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,Beautiful beach. The aquamarine water is picturesque and one of the finest places to relax I have ever been to. Plenty of water sports to enjoy.
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,...it's just that kind of season! The hotels are doing their best to clean up but it's still great to walk!
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,I've been to a lot of beaches Bavaro is the quintessential vacation beach white sand tropical foliage and palm trees . Lots to do and great people watching. Surf is pretty mild so easy to swim in with decent water colors. Yes seaweed is a huge problem. I can't wait to go back when the seaweed goes away.
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,The most beautiful place ever! When booking a vacation you can't beat this place the sand is like sugar on your feet and stays cool!
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,The beach is beautiful and we walked out onto the sand bar. It went pretty far in to the ocean. There were many of us out there to enjoy it.
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,Lots of seaweed but still a wonderful beach with excellent shade and fun free toys provided for the kids to build sand castles
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,Nothing but wonderful things to say about this beach. There was a lot of seaweed but they worked hard all day trying to clear it for you. The water was beautiful and the beaches were beautiful. Can't wait to visit again soon!
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,Seaweed everywhere. Not enough chairs/umbrellas. It was pretty much so annoying and gross that we only went on the beach briefly to take some pictures. Otherwise we cooled off in the pool.
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,The quality of the beach itself is good. There are restrooms in the area and sporting gear to rent. But just about 100 yards in the water there are plenty of recreational boats which completely obstruct the view!
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,The resort is located in a nice place very close to the ocean. The staff is very friendly and the food fresh and very good. Many activities during the day and evening. I recommend it.
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,The seaweed was overwhelming. I didn't spend nearly as much time in the water as I expected because there was just too much seaweed. It really took away from the experience.
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,Can't recommended.Very much plagued with seaweed.Some effort to clean but result is not good since just one machine with two worker was there.
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,Lots of seaweed but otherwise the beach was the main attraction of Punta Cana. We would have appreciated some motorized water toys (jet skis etc.)
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,Bavaro beach is gorgeous and long. It's great for running or long walks. Seaweed season is a bit of a downer but the beach itself is great.
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,I thought I was going to have a relaxing beach day for a couple days but unfortunately the seaweed has taken over. Sands are pretty water seemed ok but so much seaweed has washed upon the shore. The workers were there day and night trying to clean it up but it was still so much.
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,Fantastic place for small children (4- up) safe clean and low warn water levels allow for children to set in the lapping waves and play.
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,The beach was great lots of good restaurants and bars but there is a huge seaweed problem plaguing the beaches of DR.
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,Clearly one of the worlds best beaches white sand emerald ocean. Staff cleaning beach and grounds always
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,The beach was gorgeous you don't have a single minute of peach though. The 20 minutes we were there we had 40 people try to sell us something.
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,Beautiful beach and enjoyed being topless! The seaweed was bad but other than that its beautiful. Crowded but good!
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,It was a great vacation; everything was perfect you couldn't asked for more. Loved it will returned back anytime.
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,It is one of the most beautiful beaches in the caribean always a thrill to see and go there it is clean goes on for miles with lots of shops and resorts to visit while walking along and very safe for tourists love it always will
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,Gorgeous sugary sand crystal clear water that's great for snorkeling and a constant calm breeze that makes it easy to relax in full sun.
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,Great beach and lovely water. Can get a bit of seaweed thrown up if the sea has been rough as this is where the Atlantic collides with the Carribean
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,this was very good and the sea is the best I have visited there are so many hotels but they all seem to be very caring to the tourist lovely people lovely place
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,This beach it's spectacular the water is blueish the sand is white there so many palm trees the workers who maintain the beach they work so hard to keep it clean from seaweeds I did enjoy those walks in the morning and the views from my room it's a real Caribbean beach love it..
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,Bavaro Beach had gorgeous white sands and the water was beautiful. There was a lot of seaweed but the staff at Iberostar Bavaro Suites worked tirelessy to try and remove it; however you can't really control mother nature. Overall good experience on the beach.
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,Beach itself is gorgeous long white sand beach with tons of relaxing chairs shadow palms. Service at beach is outstanding-a lot of waitresses cleaning staff. We always could find a perfect spot for our beach experience -but we are early "birds"- at 7am -tons of preferable spots close to ocean and under the shadow
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,This time of year the beach has lots of seaweed but if you swim out a little the water is nice! The beach is nice as well.
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,this beach is beautiful can walk for miles. Seaweed was an issue this trip. Mother nature seems to be in turmoil. Did not bother us. We have been here before and this is one of the prettiest and cleanest beaches we have seen.
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,The seaweed was overwhelming and made the beach experience less exciting. I am hoping this is just a fluke of our travel and is not how the beach is normally. Also there were no seashells on the beach or in the ocean:(
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,Nice clean and clear waters white sand friendly staff at every hotel make this a great beach holiday destination.
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,We visited this beach on the Booze Cruise!!! It was absolutely beautiful!!! The water was crystal clear!!!
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,We stayed at the Royalton Hotel at Bavaro Beach. It was so beautiful and I can't wait to go back. The casino was a little small but I loved that atmosphere. The beach is simply beautiful and the waves were calm while we were there. Plenty of water sports to enjoy.
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,We went here as part of a trip and it wasn't quite as good as described. The drive up to and the edge of the beach was full of rubbish which is somewhat off putting.
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,My expectations about playa bavaro were huge. As I first arrived to the hotel I went straight to the beach. I was expecting a light blue crystaçine water but as soon as I got there I saw the reality. The water was full of algas. This was very disapointing for me.
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,Beautiful beach unfortunately there is a lot of sea weed to contend with. the ocean can be a little rough.
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,Took a "Boogie" excursion to this beach and it was so much fun. Beautifully calm turquoise blue waters. Had lunch on the beach (included with excursion) and bought some inexpensive Larimar jewelry
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,When we where there the water was very warm but very cloudy and full of sea weed the hotel would clean it up every day but at times of the day the sea weed was so intense you couldn't go in the water.
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,this time was not a great experience with beach due to seaweed abundance was all over...but 3 out of 4 times visited wasn't bad
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,Jessie's service was wonderful we would definitely come back on another vacation just because the service and the people that were there
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,Best beach here we lone Dominican Dominican republic especially for this beach specifically amazing white sands clear waters
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,The water is gorgeous shades of blue. Exquisite soft sand and lots of tropical trees makes this beach postcard perfect. I'm surprised at all the negative comments regarding the seaweed.... duh its an ocean. And there is huge daily effort to remove the seaweed from the sandy areas.
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,Bravo beach is so nice great waters and nice while sand beach were stayed at barcelo that was on the beach
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,Facility was clean. Workers were very friendly and awesome! Management was another story. Went through Interval. Had to attend the sales meeting and when we said no to a $150000 investment we were treated horribly! Night and day. Will never go back based on that experience and will never vacation at another Palladium facility.
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,Beach was nice but seaweed was awful. Couldnt get near the water they say it is like that fir hurricane season
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,The beach is beautiful but busy with solicitations to take pictures with creatures and buy something. Otherwise soft sand and beautiful water.
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,Very long white powder sand beach we walked (strolled) from the Bahia resort all the way to the Hard Rock Hotel - took a good hour each way. Set off one day with the aim of getting to the market stalls but turned around as it was far too hot!! Didn't get any hassell from the vendors on the beach.
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,Amazing beach with great snorkeling loved this beach. We walked the south side of it and really loved it.
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,Quite a bit of seaweed but it was cleaned up quickly. It left a sour smell in the air as they were cleaning it up but it went away soon after the clean up trucks were done.
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,Nice beach to go to when staying at one of the resorts. Be aware of the seaweed. The staff is pretty good about cleaning it up.
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,Unbelievable experience. Top notched. Will be back! I truly felt that I was in a Dream. This staff was remarkable and professionals.
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,More sea weed on the beach than I would prefer. The kids didn't want to get in the ocean as much after the sea weed kept washing up to shore and against them.
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,Fantastic beach a lot of people complain about the seaweed but really that's ridiculous. ..... its like going into a forrest for a walk and complaining about the leaves???? A fabulous Beach indeed!! Love it every time I go there!!
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,Super clean and safe area with a lot of restaurants at walking distance. The beach perfect it is just suger white but a little bit noisy sometimes. Cool night life non stop.
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,Bavaro Beach has the most beautiful white sand. Sun rises are spectacular. Brought my sons family this year and he his wife and his 3 girls got up early to watch the sun rise and created great pics. The water is crystal clear with jade green tint. You gotta see it!!!
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,Bavaro Beach is just truly beautiful! The sand is fine and the water is a gorgeous blue/green color. We went parasailing at Bavaro and it was just an amazing experience!
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,Had a wonderful time want to thank the crew for all the entertainment..want to know the name of the caption so I can thank him..
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,Although August is seaweed season - the beach was well maintained and cleaned daily. The beach was picture postcard and peaceful.
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,It was on the beach in mounds! However trucks and scoops worked 30 hours straight and had it all cleaned up! Awsome job! Beautiful!
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,Bavaro Beach is one of the 10 best beaches in the world and I must agree ... the water is warm in summer but still refreshing ... the color is amazing! Yes there is sea weed depending on the time of year but that happens all over the islands. There are miles of beach to walk and enjoy.
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,The water was not how I expected it to be. From looking at pictures from friends the water looked very clear blue & green but I found it to be very very cloudy from the sand & way way too much seaweed in the water and especially on the beach I was quite disappointed in the beach.
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,We had such a wonderful time here !!! Will definitely consider returning here. It has all you need for a perfect vacation !!!! Great suites great pool  wonderful restaurants etc....we give it 4 Stars !!!!
g147293,d215733,March 1 2016,Great beach perfect blue waters and nice long area to walk and explore other shops and venues. Have to write 100 words.......not much more to say. If nearby go for a walk
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,Great beach with lots of water sport activities and very safe for kids. Fun vacation for all ages and beautiful sunset..
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,Very clean clear waters silky sand bar closed too early plenty of shade hotel server Santa was awesome!!
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,with the Ocean water such a special color the waves never ending and the sun and breeze..being on the beach here is like being in a postcard! picture perfect
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,White sand bright blue water and frilled with friendly people. Bavaro Beach is truly one of the most amazing beaches I have ever visited!
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,This beach is so beautiful. It's like a tropical paradise. Crystal clear water beautiful palm trees and white sand. The beach is very clean and well maintained. You occasionally get a few vendors selling things but a simple 'no thanks' and they leave you alone. Really pretty beach. I want to go back!
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,The weather was fantastic. The water is really as blue as it is in the pictures. You are treated like royalty when you are there. A great experience.
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,not enough cover for some people. I found it could be insanely hot however picking your times is beneficial.
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,beautiful beach but constant barrage of peddlers takes enjoyment away beautiful white sand with narrow beach
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,The beach does have alot of sea weed along the water line and as you enter the water which does ruin it but gets cleaned every few days.
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,Most amazing beach! The water and view is breath taking. Just like any country you'll have to fight off the guys trying to sell pictures of the iguana with you... or a monkey!
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,Beautiful clear water. Calm perfect for all ages. Plenty of shade with palms and cabanas or bask in the sun. Many water activities to choose frm. However no jet skis available per regulations.
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,Bavaro is a nice beach white sand turquoise caribbean water palm trees but due to the hotels it's crowded and you can't really get far out in the water since there are a lot of water sports activities.
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,The beach was wonderful.There was plenty of shade if you wanted to get out of the sun. The water is shallow and calm. Great beach for floating. There was a lot of seaweed though.
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,Wld be gorgeous were it not for all the seaweed. This may be seasonal. Sand was beautifully white and soft.
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,Loved everything about it but they don't have jetskiing. Beaches were not crowded at all. THe weather and location were simply marvelous.
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,The beach was the best part of our trip. It was beautifully serene and refreshing. At night the beach looked like something out of a romance movie. It was perfect. If you're traveling with children I would totally recommended this beach.
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,Beautiful beaches! Take precaution as the sand will burn your feet if you are walking barefoot. Also there can be a lot of seaweed on the beach.
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,A really nice beach there is always a lot of seaweed on the beach in the morning but they always clear it up its unavoidable. I do feel sorry for the people who have to clean it though
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,The beach was beautiful and the water Caribbean turquoise but the week we were here (August 5-11) they were struggling with MAJOR sea weed issues. They had pay loaders removing it from the beach. In all fairness I have heard this is an issue right now many places but it was slightly disappointing.
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,Loved the beach!I ahve to say it's by far one the best beaches i've every visited. It's nice and clean.
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,Gorgeous beach! The people are friendly the water is calm and blue and the sand is white. There is a little seaweed but the beach is still great.
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,Beast beach EVER! Fine white sand wonderful water with waves that are great for couples and families alike.
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,I have now been here 3 times.. I love Bavaro its a nice place to relax and watch the boats and gets a good tan.
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,Very stunning clean  beautiful scenery with great choices of activities including soccer hammocks and water sports .sand was so soft and clean sandles are needed as the sand gets very hot in the mid day sun. All on the beach front with showers handy alongside .stunning scenery .
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,Beautiful beach second only to Negril's Seven Mile Beach which is my benchmark to this point. Seven Mile Beach had far more vendors bugging you since it is very close to the town of Negril whereas Bavaro Beach had a dedicated vendor area at the end of the beach.
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,Very clean and well kept beach. Lots of activities. We went parasailing and had a blast. Pretty economical. Peddlers left you alone if you politely said no.
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,The snaps don't do it justice. Blue sea blue sky and soft sand as fine as you'll get. My wife just loved it and it now looks like my usual 2 hr flight will be replaced by this destination again. Would t complain? Oh no.....
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,Beautiful long stretch of white sandy beach which connects several resorts in this area. It is worth taking the time to walk this stretch.
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,Not what I was expecting. beaches were not as clear as appear in pictures full of seaweed. No AC! only in rooms. The city excursion was better than the beaches. over crowded.
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,Excellent vacation spot. Breathless is a great hotel they offer good food nice pools and commodities and great entertainment. Staff is exceptional especially the E-team.
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,You can be lazy and catch a tan. This beach has a wonderful vibe to it day and night its beautiful.
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,the beach is beautiful and has lots of palm trees the surf was rough when we were there and there was some seaweed. But a powdery sandy beach. The beach vendors did not bother us at all
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,Currently the swimming is affected by Sargasso sea-weed. Cannot be helped and they clean regularly . Pity..the beach itself ..white sand and broad is beautiful .
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,The stay at Chic resort was simply royal getting up every morning headed to breakfast looking out over the beach and waters was a Spa all by itself so relaxing!
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,The beach was beautiuful and the sand silky white. However there was so much seaweed that you could not get in the water. Locals stated this is very unusual but we were there for 6 days dump trucks and front end loaders all day every day trying to clean area up.
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,Very nice beach with white powder sand except for all the sargassum seaweed found where we stayed. They need to do more to help this problem.
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,On our trip there was so much scratchy algae or seaweed that it made swimming uncomfortable. It filled the beach. They felt like stiff plastic plants. (July 25-30 2015)
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,The beach is perfect! Sand as soft as powder ocean is cool. There is some seaweed but it's not enough to ruin some's day!!!
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,Bavaro beach is a beautiful relaxing beach. The sand is soft. There are plenty of activities to entertain all the family.
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,One of the best beaches I've seen...white sand pristine water palm trees....absolutly beautiful. The beach is wide enough to acomodate the tourist and it's usually very well maintained.
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,What's better than getting some Vitamin D listening to the ocean waves and all the Rum you could possibly want?! (All-Inclusive) Great location!
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,The beach is watered at Now Larimar daily and the whole beach is raked of seaweed several times a day! Beautiful views with room for all!
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,Beautiful and quiet beach. Very very peaceful ....I was there for my hubby's 40th. We stayed on the adult side but walked from the 'family side' though the 'adult side' to the 'local side'
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,We love Bavaro Beach. The hotel try to keep the sea weed away from the beautiful beaches and are constantly cleaning up. We always return to Bavaro Beach the water where we have stayed is calm for swimming. Recently we stayed at the Majestic Colonial and the service there was excellent.
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,We were exposed to this while we were at the Riu Bambu Hotel. Is this a private beach or public beach. It should be advised that nude bathing is allowed so that parents can make a choice to stay here or not. To late to find this out after you have done paid for the trip.
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,Beautiful Beach excellent resorts love the all inclusive resorts in the area great entertaining nice dining !
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,Geared up for families No quiet areas if you wanted to relax hotel entertainment poor and overcrowded in the lobby on evenings
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,Beautiful beach with palm trees and soft white sand sea weed is becoming a problem though but most of the resorts try to clear it up security is tight on the beaches so you feel safe
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,The beach was clean and beautiful. The sand was soft enough to walk upon without shoes. The only issues we had was finding chairs and people get very possessive over them. However this is a typical issue for most popular beaches. Also not much shade from trees you need to get there early if you want a hut for shade.
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,Beautiful relaxing beach. A lot of boat traffic in the afternoon and late morning. Seaweed a little annoying but is ok if cleared off frequently. Beautiful sunrises and sunsets!
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,I totally enjoyed this resort. The food was excellent with multiple choices. I would definitely stay here again.
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,Overall beach and water is beautiful...white sands palm trees nice blue water. Some areas depending on the time of year I suppose has quite a bit of seaweed.
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,Bavaro Beach is one of the best beaches in DR indeed! White-soft sand clear water clean and safe beach.
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,Bavaria Beach was stunning to the eyes despite the seaweed that came in with the tide. Many people were in the water taking advantage of all the water sports it had to offer.
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,Simply sublime - white sands clear blue water palm trees. It had it all! A long stretch to walk along lots of water sports available.
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,Beautiful white sandy beach. Many areas to sit under huts. Service (drinks) available at all times. Safe Security always around.
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,Love the beach In July there is seaweed though cleaned up every morning by staff. December water clear and beautiful.
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,Lovely beach  spolled by the endless seaweed being washed up. .Not what I was expecting at all as I was led to believe that this was the 1 of the best beach areas to go.
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,I was very disappointed with the beach. The beach was filled with seaweed. And to top that the water was filled with seaweed as well. The water temperature was nice and it was a little wavy. It was not a place where I spent a lot of time. After one time " pool here I come"
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,The beach is beautiful with plenty of options for seating. There was seaweed on the beach but workers tried to clean it as much as they could each day. Not much they can do about nature. The seaweed was not really a problem. Make sure you have sunblock!
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,A beautiful beach! Lots of Palm trees and the water is so pretty! The sand is white and not grainy making for long walks on the beach a pleasure! The sunsets are awesome here such a great place to go and enjoy and relax! I could live there!
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,Pros: Whitesoft sand and clear warm waters. Hotel worked everyday to make sure they cleared the bit of seaweed seen. Cons: Bit of seaweed but it's a global change.
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,Needs some cleaning up . I was not real impressed. Tour photos were not up to date. More seaweed every day!
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,I love the temperature of the water but I like hot things. My hubby would have liked a bit cooler. The clear blue waters are gorgeous. Unfortunately there was a good amount of seaweed. The sand is a beautiful white with red grains all throughout.
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,Best time spent Best reauaturant Vento .toy find good welcomed person active and tray to help lovely as Cesar Luis &Aila R. Working also in gabi clubs
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,Breathtaking beach with a great ocean view. Very clean and peaceful. Relax in the sun or shade listening to the relaxing waves and feeling that ocean breeze!
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,Like any other beach in the Caribbean. Lots of algae in the area at the time of our visit. This was the norm for most of the beaches in the area. It's nature.
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,White Sandy Beach Seaweed in the morning; cleared by the afternoon. Obscured view by Wedding Gazebo Soccer goals & tall trees.
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,beautiful location a place to rest and enjoy yourself. Not a lot to do off the resort but fun for families
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,The water was warm and pretty clear  even do there was a lot of weeds that made it dirty. The hotel did try to keep up with the cleaning of the area
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,Amazing beach we stayed on Bavaro beach for a week and loved every minute of it! Would definitely recommend.
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,Beautiful beach. Our first night was the beach party and we got there just in time for all the festivities. Lots of fun dancing and drinking and enjoying the entertainment!!!
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,This beach was breathtaking. We took a buggie ride that ended at this beach. Absolutely beautiful!!!
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,I liked this beach. Nice and wide and clean. Lovely sand. Worth going to for the day. I found it better than my hotel neach.
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,Went with a tour group and had a great time. The beach was super clean and the water was warm. Great for kids
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,Lovely beach and white sand. We went here for a snorkeling tour and the area was so lovely and clean!
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,I was very disappointed piles of seaweed!!!! It was gross!!!! Up side hundreds of beautiful fish. Go there when their is no seaweed
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,The palm trees that line the beach are absolutely gorgeous. The seaweed is annoying but beyond that all else was beautiful.
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,There was a lot of seaweed being washed up onto the beach everyday. The hotel staff would clean up every morning but was having a hard time keeping up with it.
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,We loved the beach long walks along the beach in the morning before it got to hot .In our resort Ocean Blue and Sand my husband booked one of the photographers so we got very nice photographs in the resort and on the beach . There is plenty to do plenty too see at the beach
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,Very nice beach but not sure what the hype is all about. The seaweed was 4 feet high and the vendors were enough to make you crazy. Cancun River Maya is just as nice and cheaper.
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,This beach was nice and clean. It was such a beautiful and relaxing site from our room. We even got some very beuatiful pictures for our memories on this beach!
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,Great beach near most of the resorts but you have to deal with seasonal sea weed. Not as nice as Macao or some of the remote beaches we visited on excursions.
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,From the snuba to the speed boat it was a awesome time!! Eric from the crew was very patience and allowed me to gain my nerve to go 20 feet down to the ocean floor.
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,We travelled to Bahia Principie Punta Cana Esmeralda is where we stayed second trip had a wonderful time food location weather staff was great the staff here go beyond there call of duty to help make your staff comfortable.
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,The beach had way too much seaweed. The water was cloudy. Water was warm. Nice place to relax if you do not mind little green things around you...
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,We liked the beach because they had activities but alot of seaweed. the waiters on the beach were very attentive.
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,Clear water and beautiful white sand this is a wonderful beach! The water was much warmer than the water at the resort pools!
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,Another great beach! The water was beautiful and the beach itself wasn't too rocky. You could swim and the temperature was perfect.
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,Fantastic beach!! We have visited this beach on 4 occasions and it is really one of the nicest beaches you can find. Weather was gorgeous!
g147293,d215733,February 29 2016,The beach is the best thing in the area. Nothing else is worth going to. Save your money and enjoy the beach or go on a party boat for the day of fun in the sun.
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,The water and sand were absolutely beautiful! Seaweed was a bit of a problem in some areas. I didn't get in the water because it was too cold.
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,Take advantage of the beach! Did some local shopping but the vedors will NOT leave you alone to look.
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,Great beach can walk for hours! Sometimes windy it's still nice to swim in the waves. Can be busy at times make sure you get there early
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,The sand is white like powder. The water is crystal clear. You can walk and have the beach to yourself. The water is very calm.
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,We went on an excursion from this beach. It was really a lot of fun and well worth the money spent.
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,Very beautiful property. Great staff made the check in & out process easy. I would definitely stay here again.
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,The most amazing beach! White sand so it is great to walk on not hot and no rocks. Have traveled quite a bit no other beach compares.
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,The beach was nice had several restaurants and shops right there. The drinks was great and food was amazing and was decently priced.
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,Bavaro beach is beautiful. The water is calm and blue. Coconuts readily available for those of you that love coconuts.
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,This is where most of the resorts are located. nice beach and water but unfortunately experienced seasonal seaweed. Poor guys cleaning the beach couldn't keep up with. Winds settled done the last day we were there and that seemed to help out tremendously.
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,Bavaro Beach is one of the most beautiful beaches I have ever been to. The Paradisus has lounge chairs with umbrellas all across their beach and it is very relaxing.
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,loved the beach went during excursion and would have loved to spend more time there with out being hassled to buy this or look at that
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,There are no words yet invented to describe how magnificent this beach is. Cliffs white sand amazing water. It's fantastic!
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,No one told us that the seaweed is ridiculous! The staff said it was normal there was a foot tall pile extending about 5 feet back from the shore line for our entire stay. The hotels try to clean it up but they can't win the battle. If you don't mind swimming with seaweed go for it.
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,Justo as the specialized magazines say...no waves. But the proximity to the river makes the water a brownish-green. In sunny days ir becomes turquoise beautiful! But don't expect the wonderful Carribean blue.
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,Bavaro Beach is perfect for long walks. When when think of a caribbean beach this is what you think of. Tall palm tress that stretch for miles. Pretty colors of blue as you look out of the Atlantic Ocean.
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,Bavaro is an icon of great beaches in DR it has a lot of good AI resorts and was the starting place for the AI boom in the island a few decades ago. Sad to hear about the Algae the government is working on it.
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,Nice but too much sea grass on the beach wich is not look good! The sea tempretaure is fantastic and clear!☺
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,I was pretty excited to get to Punta Cana and experience gorgeous water and all I found was a beach full of seaweed. Workers werer on the beach all week raking and having front end loaders empty the seaweed into dump trucks. Yes front end loaders and dump trucks. That is how much seaweed was on this beach last week!
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,Went to 3 beaches on this trip and this was the best. Sand was better here with not as much seaweed. Some good water sports too.
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,Too much seaweed making it hard to enjoy the water. The temperature was nice and sea was mostly calm with minimal waves.
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,Beautiful beach too much seaweed. Great temp. Soft sand. Gentle wavesnot enugh covered seating for all guests. Beach bar was great
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,I spent a lot of time on this beach during my stay in Punta Cana. The water was clean warm and turquoise in colour. The beach had NO seaweed beautiful white sand no garbage lots of chairs in and out of the shade and no bugs or flies. I will be back :)
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,very relaxing slightly more expensive but well worth it only 4 people on our trip and we had a great time relaxing and drinking and the boat staff was wonderful
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,Strangled with seaweed. No swimming at all. Be prepared to not enter the waters due to the large piles of seaweed all over the beach and in the waters
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,The beach is beautiful! However the vendors on the beach will try to sell you something every second you're there. The only places to eat are the resorts on that beach. They are pricey and crowded.
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,Bavaro Beach is beautiful the sand is like flour and the water you can walk right in it is warm and the waves are amazing
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,As for me i love nature and visit the beach at night and is so good to feel free and secure for there was security every were and were happy to do there job
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,We started and ended our stay in Dominican Rep at this place as it is so beautiful sandy and great. Lots of nice places to eat lots of attractions souvenirs shops but also silent places if you do not like crowd.
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,Full of seaweed and kelp. It smells as well. We were told that it is bad from jan- sept. So go elsewhere if you want a nice beach. This was unswimmable!!
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,Very beautiful beach with natural palm trees and powder white sand. Crystal clear warm water with gentle rolling waves.The only problem is the amount of sea grass we experienced in the water during our stay.
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,The water was beautiful and Bavaro is one of my favorite beaches. This time there was a lot of sea weed. The hotel Iberostar Grand did their best to clear as much as hey could so we could enjoy the beach. Will visit again.
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,Beautiful beach with plenty miles to walk or relax in a cabana or hut. The beach events make the experience even more enjoyable. The number of weddings and various setups were perfect.
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,The water is full of seaweed. The beach is totally lined with seaweed. The resort we stayed in had a bar on the beach which was nice.
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,Absolutely loved the beach!!!! The sand was white and the water was a beautiful blue. Loved waking up every morning to the beautiful scenery.
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,blue sky white sand <3 we was not expecting much when we snorkeled by the beach but we still saw some fishes which was quite surprising.
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,Yes there was a lot of seaweed like previously posted multiple times! But wasn't it better than being at work? Didn't they work diligently each morning raking it up? Didn't you still have a great time? We did!!!!
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,Beautiful and natural beach. Look past the sea weed and you will see beautiful torquise water natural palms and the whitest sand anywhere.
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,seaweed and bulldozers ruin the nice sugary sand and coconut palm covered beach. Alsothe water is not turqoise like the photos it is mostly brownish.
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,Beatiful place to relax take the sun and a drink. Long beach. White sand and great people. Is a beautiful beach with many things to do. Good for couples in honeymoon. Good for families. And is good for have fun in the night. A lot of discoteques restaurants and bars. Highly recommended.
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,There was way too much seaweed and coral washing up on shore. People were cutting their feet on the coral/rock in the sand. Very windy too!
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,This beach is huge one of the main beaches and there are so many day trips and activities to keep everyone happy and entertained.
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,We walked up and down this beach from our hotel. Very nice early in the morning and late afternoon. Definitely more seaweed than desirable but all part of Mother Nature.
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,Alot of seaweed on shore and in the water.Seen better Beaches in the U.S. Very disappointed!!!! The hotel was nice.
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,Nice white sand beach with no rocky areas.. Some seaweed problems if the beach is not cleaned daily.
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,A great beach beautiful water & gorgeous sand. Its an easy beach to walk on as it doesn't have much of a slope one of the nicest.
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,This beach was COVERED in seaweed... it freaked me out the first day but I got use to it by time our trip ended.
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,There's no music or stress they bring you drinks all day long so nothing to complain about. The sea is nice and cooling but bear in mind that there is a lot of seaweed.
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,and when you get to the water it is so thick and gross you cant swim. Shame on them for having those pictures of beautiful turquoise water
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,Beautiful place white sandy beach crystal-clear water had a blast had a great lunch with great people I suggest you try to negotiate a deal for for the catamaran especially if you have a large group which we did 26 I would definitely do it again when I go back next year in 2016
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,very clean beach always raking any seaweed that washes in lunch onthe beach is wonderful as well love love it !!
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,Lovely resort with great gardens and sport facilities Pool was huge with most rooms overlooking pool We got upgraded to suite with a see view which was amazing Casino on site and right next to wildlife park Food was good with a huge choice of styles Entertainment was really good
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,White soft sand and clear water! Plenty of sun beds and lots of palm trees. The beach stretches for miles and you can stroll along enjoying the scenery and views of the neighboring hotels. Very tranquil place to be.
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,Food Service Rooms Beach Club Premium shopping was fun exciting and will be returning. Casino has less than experienced dealer girls. They are not vegas.
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,This is a beautiful beach with soft sand and gentle surf. There are a string of resorts each with its own area for bar service and restaurants. It's a very nice place to sit and relax and enjoy the sun.
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,Great beach but there was a ton of seaweed. It was pretty cool how far out you can go yet the water was still shallow. There was a 'natural pool' close by (shallow water far from the shore)
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,Nice beach not expectional. Some vendors they were not bothersome. A little bit more drink service would have been nice. but otherwise ok.
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,Nice cabana porches for shade good attendants drink service. Manuel was great! There were seaweed blooms 2 ft. high along beach before you could get to water. They brought in bull dozers to cart it off 2 days after we complained. Still did not help. Average Caribbean beach. would not use it again
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,wonderful area very clean and very swimmable no hassle from the locals truly a great place to go with your family
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,There was a lot of seaweed that was pretty scratchy! Nice sandy bottom though! The water is nice and warm and the beach is nice and sandy!
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,We were able to see this gorgeous beach when we went on our snuba/snorkeling excursion. It was clear waters great company lots of music and swimming.
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,Bavaro beach has high quality white sand and turquoise water. There are multiple spa and golf resorts located so multiple options available.
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,This beach is by far my favorite in the Dominican Republic! Gorgeous water white sands and palm trees. What more could you possibly ask for??
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,Nice clean beach fine sand water is warm as bathwater and isn't rough at all. The hotel we were in had plenty of bohios close to the waterline so we never felt crowded. Very sunny and hot. Rained a few times but mostly quick showers.
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,We vacationed in Punta Cana on beautiful Bavaro Beach. The water was perfect temperature the sand seemed endless. It was calm enough that even novices could enjoy kayaking and sailing there. If walking on the beach is your thing this is your place.
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,Sand and warm water everywhere!!! No shells no rocks some seaweed when you venture away from the resorts. Had a great time!!
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,beach is long - 2 miles of a white sand and you can freely walk the beach. it is well maintained regardless of the hotel
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,The lounge area by the beach was awesome but there was a ton of seaweed being washed ashore. The water was also too cold for me to swim in but ok to put my feet in!
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,The beach was pretty weather was fantastic. The only downfall was sea weed that came in and couldn't be successfully removed. They just couldn't keep up. A little too much selling on the beach.
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,My husband and I loved walking down this clear and white sandy beach. It wasn't crowed at all and the temperature was to die for.
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,The charm to these beaches is that you can walk along them they aren't chopped up by the resorts. The seaweed can be a bummer but they do a good job cleaning it up
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,Beach is wonderful. Waves are not big - perfect for small kids. There is seaweed. The resorts do clean up some of it but it wasn't a problem for us. In fact my son enjoyed playing with the seaweed in the water !
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,Beach too much seaweed in sea and beach. Would return to DR but another location and quieter hotel. People very friendly but vendors a bit of a pain but went away when told no.
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,It is one of the most beautiful beach which I have ever seen. I was here two times and definetly I would like to come back. Caribbean is a Caribbean...paradise on the world.
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,One of the most beautiful beaches in the area clear and clean water miles of beaches white sands but be carefull it's very hot.
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,Bavaro beach can be walked for miles water is clear and calm no undertow or big drops to worry about
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,Nice white sandy beach but there was sea weed washing off at the sand which crew tried to clean everyday. Wasn't too crowdy when we visited so lots of beach chairs were available. There is bar and snack available close by.
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,Too much seaweed and very busy. However the staff of the hotel made it very nice to be there. They would get to know you and make sure you had whatever you wanted.
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,We stayed at a resort along Bavaro Beach and it was absolutely breath taking! There was little to no rocks! We walked along there for a while and never came across any sort of crazy creature! We even sat in the water and had some drinks without any issues. I would definitely go back to this beach again!
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,This beach is really nicely kept . Every day staff off the nearby hotels are even removing the alges brought in by the sea. Also a nice location for sunset and photography. You can walk for miles and the beachis not crowded at all.
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,Nice wide beautiful beaches with lots of palm trees but shorelines and waters edge is nothing but seaweed. Water clarity was not great due to all the seaweed and we have never seen NO FISH!! We love to snorkel but nothing to see where we were
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,This is a beautiful beach with powdery white sand. The staff at our hotel was routinely out picking up seaweed to keep it aesthetically appealing to patrons.
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,When we went the beach was full of sea weed. It was unbearable to get into the water. Employees stated that there were a lot of storm and that was the reason for the sea weed in the ocean. Over all the sand was smooth
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,Beautiful clear water. Super white soft sand. Nice breeze. I had been in August. It was too hot and humid. I will be back but not during the summer months.
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,Incredible beach with turquoise water but with a LOT of seaweed (like mountains) if you want to swimming maybe it is a good idea choose playa de arena blanca or others near to main resorts like Grand Paladium.
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,beach was nice but there was too much seaweed not sure if it's normal on this time of year - the hotel tried to clean it but it takes days to finish
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,Well it was a very busy beach - slight traffic from bus tours and boogies. Small diner shops and dogs. The dogs were non-aggressive but just be aware in case you don't care for them. I love them but didn't go close. The view was beautiful. We didn't swim because of choppy waters.
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,The beach was nice but there is a lot of seaweed in the water and that washes up on the beach. The water is not the sparkling blue that I have seen in other parts of the Caribbean but it was pretty. Also did not have the white sand like I was told it would.
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,This is without a doubt one of the best beaches that I have ever been on! Loved it! The swimming is fantastic just sand on the bottom. Always windy so there are nice waves - makes it fun.
g147293,d215733,February 28 2016,Another fine beach in D>R> no rocks or little pieces of shell to stub or cut your feet just soft sand and great walking and swimming
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,if you are looking to take a walk on the beach this would be the place to go...nice white sand and blue water
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,The beach was beautiful but it did have a lot of sea grass. They did have a tractor go through in the morning but by afternoon it was full of grass again. It was still beautiful but if you'd be bothered feeling it was against your leg while your in the ocean it may not be the beach for you.
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,This is one of the 10 rated most beautiful beaches in the world. Very clean refreshing water. The sand is white soft and oowdery there are lifeguards along the beach at the various resorts.
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,The view from your beach chair will stay with you forever! White soft sand a light breeze & crystal blue water make this beach heaven on earth! The palm trees make you feel like you are in your own tropical oasis
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,We stayed at the Iberostar Grand. I highly recommend and we will definitely be going back. This is a great property and is well maintained and the staff was great. The food was great but we enjoyed the buffet more than the themed restaurants.
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,The sand was the perfect white sand beach that you look for on a vacation like this. There was a large amount of seaweed and the water was not as crystal blue as we had expected it to be. There are a lot of people trying to get you to go shopping or parasalling
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,Always enjoyed this beach It is so long  you can walk for hours seeing different resorts and shops along the way and a few bars what a great place.
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,Absolutely beautiful beach!! The water is so blue and the sand is white! We had a great holiday on this beach :)
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,Nice safe area to stay in for DR a must stay at Ocean Blue and Sand. We loved it all the rooms look the same no bad rooms
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,Clean beach but some seaweed. The sand was so fine and the water was so clear I loved it. The waves were minimal.
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,Beautiful beach. Some areas the ocean is a bit rougher than others but still swimmable. Some hotels do a better job than others cleaning up the seed weed. It is the ocean after all. Lots of palm trees which gave shade if you wanted it. My husband and I walked some of the beach. I highly recommend this beach.
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,Amazing beach. White sand and quiet .There are places to have a drink few palm tress to lie down. This is a must visit !
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,The beach here is beautiful with clear blue/turquoise water. The waves are gentle here with soft white sandy beaches. There are palm trees all the way down the beach. Its a picture perfect beach.
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,The beach is clean and the water a beautiful blue. Perfect temperature at all times of day! One of the most beautiful beaches I've seen!
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,What I liked was the pina coladas on the beach. We got waited on under the tiki-hut. What I disliked most was the push for sales and marketing of their timeshares.
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,Nice clean and relaxing beach good for kids and familys frendly staff coconut fresh per request water is warm but not too much shower available on every beach
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,Awesome beach had been there 3 times the last 2 years and is always beautiful. A little bit of seaweeds during summer but all around you will never regret. Will be there soon again.
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,Nice clean beach and not too much people in february. I felt safe. Nice for walk beach is very long. Nice to look in other resorts.
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,Beautiful beach. Not all the beaches in Punta Cana have been great when we've been there. We always end up on the ocean side instead of the Caribbean side. The resorts are great but the storms wash a lot of junk onto the beaches and though they work hard to keep them clean it's hard to keep up.
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,must stay on Bavaro Beach very soft white sand. you can dig as deep as you want and it is all soft sand. Nice palm trees on beach. beach is wonderful!
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,One of the best beaches I visited. Benn here many times and always enjoy it. Just a little too much seaweed.
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,Love love love beautiful water soft sands and at many times tranquil for bobbing around up to your neck! The color of the water is amazing and ever changing very clean and clear even in deeper water.
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,By far the nicest of beaches in the Dominican. The white sand leading to the beautiful Caribbean water. Very refreshing after a nice walk along the beach.
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,Great soft white sand. The resort had perfect cabanas towel service and food and drink at the beach. The only slight negative was the large amount of seaweed and grass. The Carribean has the warmest water and best beaches and this was on par with the best.
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,Excellent Beach warm white fine sand. Somewhat private but you can walk for a few miles seeing condos and other resorts. Best beach in Dominican.
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,Very beautiful beach the most known in Punta Cana. With very nice and kind people. The best beavh i ever seen.
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,Nice water palm trees hotel facilities and animation games. There are also lots of tour operators selling trips and other activities.
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,lots of vendors. all friendly and most not too pushy. remember a few names(most are" Cheapie Cheapie (insert quirky name here)" and drop the names when the next one tries to stop you. worked for me. beautiful beach.
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,The beach and sand was pretty nice to lay out to get a good breeze. During our stay there was a lot of seaweed don't like getting in the ocean with that around my feet and legs.
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,Swimming was nice and the sand was clean but there is seaweed everywhere. Not just on the beach but in the water which can make swimming kinda frustrating.
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,Beach was pretty but definitely way more seaweed than we would have liked. If you are looking for a pristine beach than this may not be for you. The sand was like white powder but the shoreline and water just too much seaweed.
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,This is the popular beach of the hotel guests. This beach is dedicated to the hotels infra structure there are chase lounge available shadow by palmeiras and a lot of things to do paraglider fly boat rapid boat radical boat pirate boat caiaque paddle boat and a lot of representative sales to tours.
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,Our hotel room was only a 5 min stroll from this beach you could join in the activitesbeach areobicslearn to dance the merengui and the bachacha or just laze inthe sun and drink the lovely local coctails
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,This beach was packed with seaweed. The water was calm but the seaweed made it almost impossible to enjoy. There were cleaners on the beach to scoop it all into one big pile but as soon as they were finished more seaweed was added.
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,We stayed at one of the RUI hotels and we were on Bavaro Beach most of the time... It was beautiful and clean totally recommend it.
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,The beaches are great and very clean. The weather couldn't get any better. Great staff at the beach.
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,To much seaweed and spoilt by shop sellers......😁 beware being ushered into a shop and paying over the top for tat! Do not go alone.
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,The beach was full of seaweed their was piles of seaweed on the beach. I t was not cleaned at all. I have never seen anything like this before.
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,Beautiful beach. Only drawback was the large amount of seaweed in the water. The water is beautiful otherwise and felt good
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,Friendliness of staff. There was excellent selection of food and chef willing to prepare what might have not been at the buffet.
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,The beach was lovely however the shoreline is full of seaweed and disguised rocks (they look like sand). The water is warm and you can walk out to sea a fair distance and still be able to stand up with no problem. Free kayaks and catamaran rides are an added bonus!
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,The sand was amazing. A little too much seaweed but I hear that's seasonal. Water was warm but refreshing!
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,Super beach soft silky white sand lovely ocean! Lots of sunloungers and shade. The odd bit of seaweed but thats nature didn't detract from the overall ambiance of the beach experience.
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,Amazing water Pretty weed free Just beautiful. Wave action is very calm. So clear it is easy to see fish and feet even in several feet of water
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,The beach was pristine and gorgeous! The water temperature was perfect it was like walking through a postcard.
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,I know it is not something they can control but some days the sea weed was overwhelming. Some days it was manageable but others you would go in only to run out again.
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,Very beautiful beach clean soft sand clear beautiful water. We stayed at the barcelo dominican beach and had a great time at their beach
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,There is a ton of algae in the water and on the beach shore. Try to visit a different section of Dominican Republic to enjoy the atmosphere better.
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,Liked... beach and the parasailing and other water activities offered. Did NOT like: being approached by men/women trying to make deals haggle etc. I want to be left ALONE. If I want something i will ask you. They are very determined and I appreciate their desire to work but it got annoying.
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,I can see why it is one of the most beautiful beaches in Punta Cana. The water view is gorgeous. The sand is light coloured and soft. It is a very relaxing beautiful beach. It goes on and on and on
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,great beach! beautiful sunsets palm trees everywhere lovely. Friendly and (not pushy) vendors and great place to just hang out and relax
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,This is an amazing white sandy beach! It's clean with clear waters and ideal for relaxation. One of the beaches I've visted so far.
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,But the food is horrible!! I could not find anything good to eat but Spaghetti. They need some lessons on seasoning the foods.
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,The part of this beach we stayed on was absolutely beautiful. White sand and blue water. Was there mid June. Water was warm and calm. Good bit of seaweed but did not hinder a good time on the beach or in the water!
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,I went to the "Adult Only" and I loved the quiet. No running screaming children cannon balling in the pool. It was just adults talking and relaxing. The food was sensational. You couldn't want for more! I would recommend Bavaro Beach to anyone looking for a fabulous time!
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,Bavaro Beach is definitely one of the most beautiful beaches I have been to with stunningly beautiful sugar white coral sand that never gets hot warm water and entertainment with watching people do water sports and hotel entertainment.
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,We stayed at the Bavaro Princess Hotel and Spa right on the Bavaro beach. The beach was well maintained clean and the water was crystal clear. Glad we stayed at this hotel on this beach!
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,The beach is beautiful and they are always kept clean of seaweed. The water is crystal clear aquamarine and warm.
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,the beaches of Punta Cana resorts are exquisite. powdery sand nice small waves and clear blue/green waters. the resorts work very hard to keep the beaches free of debris and sea weed! that take lots of work and effort and it gets done so you and i can swim and enjoy. it was awesome
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,Beautiful powdery white sand which endlessly stretches from left to right!!!! One of the best beaches I've had the pleasure of visiting :)
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,We experienced the beach while staying at the Barcelo complex. Absolutely beautiful! Soft white sand lined with palm trees and clear turquoise water. There is a fair bit of seaweed but they make an effort to clear it up and it doesn't prevent swimming or snorkelling. There are quite a few varieties of fish to see straight off the beach.
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,Our resort was located on Bavaro Beach and we wouldn't have had it any other way. The beach is well maintained and not too crowded even in high season.
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,As always a great place to visit. Almost everything is all-inclusive. Watch out for the stalkers trying to sell you touristic packages.
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,Loved the powdery white sand and clear blue ocean water. Walked for miles never ending beach paradise!
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,The people were so friendly and accommodating. A fun filled relaxing vacation! The beaches and water are absolutely gorgeous. My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our 10th anniversary get away.
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,This beach was great. Due to storm activity there was some seaweed in the water and the beach but our resort did a good job cleaning the beach.
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,No waves! White sand and green/blue water. We loved every inch of it. It's not easy to find but its worth the effort!! You can spend the whole day there are local restaurants souvenir shops tour boats. Look for bibijagua market or beach if you don't want to miss it.
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,Bavaro beach was very nice although the last few days we were there we noticed there was a lot of sea weed on the beach but it could possibly just be the time of year and the tide. Overall it was beautiful!
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,You can stroll along the beach for hours and admire the views. The beach is very long and at most of the hotels well maintained. The problem tend to be traders who try to sell their products and services but fortunately usually are not too pushy.
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,This rustic beach is nothing to write home about ! Sand and more sand. You are brought there to catch the boats for the Dolphins Cruises and other water related excursions.
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,Nice to walk along and see the other resorts. I think we made a great choice. Felt very safe walking at 6 am. Great for pictures! First time in DR and loved Bavaro
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,Blue waters and white sand! No complaints on the beach whatsoever. Very nice and clean beach and the algae is controlled.
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,Love my evening walks up and down the beach for as long as you can go popping in and checking out other resorts.
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,Liked the beautiful scenery and the water changing colors sand is beautiful but few sticks and dried seaweed on beach was annoying.
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,Simply Amazing! The beach is really beautiful and that is a perfect place to relax and enjoy every moment of your holiday! I do recommend also coming to the beach in the evenings when it gets less busy!
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,But it was rough waves. Southern side of island was extremely calm. The water was like glass over there: smooth and clear.
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,This beach goes for miles and while theSargasso weed is abundant moststretches are cleaned by the hotels. There are no rocks or sharp objects to hurt a tenderfoot like me We are walkers and loved the long dailystrols
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,This resort was okay upon arrival but that was quite the opposite my ipad was stolen on the very 1st day I think they have a master key for the safes
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,The water is beautiful and it was so much to do on the beach. I took Salsa classes and participated in a kickboxing course. It was pretty intense but very fun. It's something for all ages to partake in
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,This is a very pretty beach. Silky sand and lots of beach. In June there is a lot of sea grass and seaweed in the water and on the shore. Nobody clears it but that would make a huge difference if they did. It wasn't pleasant to swim in it.
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,I have seen loads of them but bavaro beach is one of the nicest and most beautiful ones..delicate sand and palm trees and so clean..can not wait to come back and see bavaro again!
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,Public beach with many sales people but amazing water with clean sand. Be away of seaweed sometimes. Not as clean or white as Caribbean side.
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,Great beach. Need to visit the Scuba Caribe and ask for Zacharias  he was very kind and extremely knowledgable - well worth the cost.
g147293,d215733,February 27 2016,Had a great excursion booked on my bday Thnks to Zacharias !! He was very personable and professional! Had a great time!
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,What beautiful energetic welcoming people! Perla Felix and Sandy helped us adjust taught us to communicate and helped us have a fun stay. They never sat still and always had something to offer us. From Spanish lessons to yoga to volleyball. We loved being around them and already miss them! ¡Gracias a nuestros nuevos amigos
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,What an excellent beach. Of all of the places I have been to in the Caribbean this is the most beautiful. White sands and blue water. You can walk for miles in either direction and it is safe as it is covered with tourists and resorts. This is a must see beach.
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,If you're there how can you not enjoy the beach? Water is a good temperature after a bit of adjustment and the sand is great. Our section was not too crowded but that appears to vary by resort. There is a fair amount of seaweed on the beach even though they clean it every morning.
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,As good as any beach I've been to. Many areas have palm trees for shade i.e. Barcelo Bavaro beach resort. It is so flat I've run miles on it. Barrier reef gives protection from waves. Some erosion at Ocean Blue and Sand property. Great sand. Usually minimal undertow. Saw one review that called it a top 10 in the Americas.
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,Best vacation we ever had!!!!! Can't wait to go back!!!! Great resort pool beaches staff food drinks etc. The only I would like to go to an adult the next time. To many little kids.
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,Excellent beach !! Needs more chairs and beach waiters to bring you drinks !!Water is clear / no seaweed .There always cleaning and raking the beach daily .Well maintained !
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,The beach was awesome and the cookouts were good. There was also a restaurant on the beach along with various activities that you could par take of
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,Great beach. If you walk round to Hard Rock Hotel it's even better. Clean sand and crystal clear waters. It's worth the 15 minute walk from the hotel.
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,This was such a beautiful place. We saw all kinds of sea creatures including different types of fishes a sea snake and a white sting ray.
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,Bavaro Beach at Paradisus Palma Real was absolutely gorgeous clean and very safe with several security guards staffed by Paradisus.
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,Nothing I didn't like about it! had servers filling drinks lots of little huts for shade and had no waves. Was a very good experience
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,Absolutely beautiful green/blue warm water and awesome white sand beaches. You can't ask for a better beach to relax on.
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,Great for body surfing as the waves can get pretty big. The water is also quite cool so that's nice. But if you want a peaceful relaxing swim you might want to stick to the pool. Or venture up to Macao beach which is a short taxi trip away but a way better beach and less rough.
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,What a beach! Beautiful white sand sparkling blue/green water and warm. Definitely the star of the show! Will miss the view and hope to return again.
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,The beach is beautiful. Clean and we'll kept. Plenty of seats even in the shade under the beautiful umbrellas!
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,STUNNING! clean and beautiful. The water isn't too choppy so you can stay in all day. The are fun merchants that had cute things to sell. I did not find them to be too pushy. Loved it!
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,The beach was clean white sand so relaxing not busy just beautiful! We had the most relaxing and enjoyable time on this beach.
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,Lots of vendors trying to sell their wares. Got tired of saying no. They are just pushy to be annoying but not aggressive. The beach is clean-clear blue water and nice sand. Just the picture perfect you want when on vacation. Seaweed is up to mother nature (lots of it depending on what part of the beach you are on)
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,My husband and I were here for 12 days. We absolutely loved the beach. We stayed in the Playa Turquesa condo and the beach was always pristine. Loved the consistent ocean breeze!!
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,Right next to Punta Cana... beautiful clear blue water. They offer so many excursion near Bavaro beach.
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,Beautiful beach with white sand. Very popular many resorts are at the beach. There is a lot of seaweed growing in the ocean so some of it is floating in the sea or at the beach. Due to sandy nature the water is not very clear but still very nice to do all the seaside activities including snorchling.
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,The coastal breeze is always blowing and the water is beautiful. You can't find a better beach anywhere to swim linger or simply look at.
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,The beaches here are so beautiful. The water is so calm. It's also so blue like turquoise. The sand on the beach was so soft and white.
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,Liked cleanliness. Didn't like vendors. Too many people trying to sell stuff. No that's all that I can say.
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,The water is great and the beach is white sand and there are all kinds of things to do. You can get gear to snorkel sail boat kayaking all for free just have to reserve.
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,This was our second time at this Resort Iberostar Bavaro absolutely beautiful!! We all loved it! The staff is so warm and friendly from the morning servers to the beach Staff the bar tenders etc. They are always smiling and dancing so happy!
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,I mean what can you say? It's an amazing beach. Absolutely loved it. Dying to go back. Loved the snorkeling off the beach.
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,Absolute paradise. The waves were not too strong in June the weather was perfect and water was clear.
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,Great Beach! Not much sea life by the shore but if you go out you may see a sea turtle of two! Water is room temp which is nice and sea weed is minimal.
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,We went to this beach as part of a day trip ..It was just stunning with crystal clear blue water that you can just see the bottom for ever..Had some nice waves to make it fun and it was a bright sunny day..Could not have asked for a more beautiful beach to spend some time at...
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,Blue water soft sand under your feet no rocks shells. Lots of tiki huts for you to lounge under to be out of the sun and plenty of lounge chairs. great for walking on too did a 2 mile walk one day.
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,Nice beach but it is open to the general public and you are subject to frequent interruptions by vendors.
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,Pristine warm crystal blue waters and white sand for miles! I just visited for a couple of hours but from what I saw it was fantastic!
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,Really nice beach plenty to do excursion wise from parasailing to scuba diving to driving your own speed boats. The waters are warm and so clear you can see the tropical fish beneath you :-:-)
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,Clear blue waters and nearly white sands. Seaweed is kept a minimum and some days practically none existent.
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,This is a very nice beach. It has a lot to offer around it too so be sure to check. Bavaro the city has some nice shops and Beron another city is also close by.
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,Great sandy beach with bars along itlovely ocean.Didnt like the irritating sales people going up and down the beach all day trying to sell us trips and local trinkets.
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,This is a wonderful resort especially for couples. The beach was nice and clean the food was excellent and the customer service was exceptional. I will recommend getting a room on the ground floor as it is more convenient.
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,Beautiful serene beach w/ plenty of palm trees throughout the walking distance! White sand clear water!
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,We had the opportunity to enjoy this beautiful beach when in Punta Cana..The blue clear water is just amazing!
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,Perfect waters but be careful. Our taxi driver stayed and waited for us for three hours. It was worth it. A lot of local souvenirs can be purchased there as well.
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,Be aware that sea grass washes up in the mornings and or collects in spots in the water. It has quite at odor at times but attention to clean up and removal is prompt.
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,The beautiful sandy beach has palm trees scattered through out making it unique and beautiful. Great walking beach as it goes on and on.
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,Snorkling was truly an experience to remember. The 2 guides on the catamaran were excellent hosts and the fish we saw underwater were indescribably beautiful!
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,Most beautiful beach of all my travels thus far. Soft white sand as far as the eye can see and very clean. I was disappointed to find most sand in Hawaii was imported but this natural white sanded beach is amazing 😆👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,Did not see any seaweed when we stayed. The beach is like The Bounty adverts. My wife Carol got taken out to sea on a Catamaran whilst we were trying to launch it. Immediately there were 10 different languages shouting instructions how to turn the boat around it was hilarious!
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,Medication and item was stolen from my friends room the management did nothing to help. Will never recommend this resort. We had a party of 27 women.
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,The beach is beatiful I just didn't like that there are a lot of algae on the sea and in a big part of the beach Thanks God in our Resort area it was just on the sea and not every day. The sea is calm is very good to relax.
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,clean surf not too strong but there is surf. People Dominican not pushy selling things as much. Hotels on beach offer pools and Bavaro Beach all inclusive includes airfare transfer to and from airport food and drinks for great prices.
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,The beach is very nice. The sand is soft and thick. The water is gorgeous. The drinks are plentiful. At times there was too much seaweed in the water and washed up on the beach. However one of the nights we were there a truck came through and cleared it up. We truly enjoyed the beach experience.
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,Beautiful white sand beach with lots of activities to do. You will LOVE it!! This is one of the best beaches in the area if not the entire Island.
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,If you want to see a beach like on a postcard visit Bavaro Beach! So beautiful! White sand crystal clear water a soft breeze.... can't ask for more heaven on earth!
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,Activities galore on white sand beach. Parasail ultralight rides snorkeling tons of seating bars small sail boats & on & on. Beach is in a reef that slopes very slowly stays moderately shallow out quite a ways. Nice-nice-nice!
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,Very pretty not a huge beach some underwater rocks water wasn't as clear as expected. Water was calm lots of palm trees to rest out of the sun.
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,Walking early morning by the shore feels so good with the breeze from the ocean it's a wonderful feeling stress free
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,Food was probably the best in the buffet. Its always fresh and the chef makes it in front of you. The resort very beautiful. The negative side is the rooms. Flod almost everyday from the sealing. And cacaroches big ones. If i dont mind it then go thre
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,a very nice beach if you like swimming in very rough seas the beach can get very crowded by the hotelsso find yourself a quite spot away from the crowds its much better.
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,A nice beach but surrounded by resorts so nothing to do other than to walk along the water and people watch.
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,lots of room ! very wide and clean but get to the beach early cause the chairs are taken .............
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,Very clear water (green-clear not blue-clear). Lots of seaweed washed up each day but it didn't bother us.
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,One of the best beaches ever! We were here for a week and the water and sand are incredible. The Dominican people are very friendly and the beach is always fun.
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,Plenty of water sports.sun loungers etc lush white soft sand walk for miles very safe for children. Very clean like being in paradise.
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,Fifth trip hear and it was dirtier then we have ever seen it... Punta Cana used to have freshly scraped beaches.. no twigs seaweed large shells garbage and now it does!! Shame on them
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,This is one of the best beaches we have ever been. Well worth going to. Long beautiful soft sand and lovely palm trees. Amazing!!!
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,This beach is amazing! Great view very clean and just breath taking Absolutely gorgeous. The sand is soft and clean!
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,Absolutely georgeous sand beautiful turquoise sea. Great for swimming in and feeding the fish. There can be many people walking up and down - its fabulous first thing in the morning or before the sun goes down.
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,We stayed at a condo right on Bavaro Beach. Sand is nice some seaweed. Waves aren't too strong nice for good simmers. Water is a little murky due to the sand. Very warm like bath water. There are security men at each resort so I felt very safe walking along the beach at night. Always a nice cooling breeze.
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,great rides to and from the island.....the food was good but I didn't like swimming so close to the gas powered and pollution of the boats.......saddened me to see this the boats also ripped up large fan coral and other parts of the reef that flora was lilttering the beach access
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,Everything the service was very friendly and so accomendating to us!!! Made sure you were taken care of .
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,There was a lot of seaweed when we were there. They did work to clean it up. Water was cloudy close to the sand. I just expected crystal clear waters but that looked to be out farther. Still it was very calm and fun in the water. We were not bothered by wildlife in the water.
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,Beautiful beach and white sand. Very warm water in general but can get a little chilly in the later afternoon hours but you get used to it. Went snorkeling but didn't see much I would probably book a snorkeling excursion that takes you out somewhere.
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,Nice beach  friendly staff lots of activities. Room are clean but would need to be refreshed . Menus of restaurants need to be revised to make sure translations make sense in all languages. Restaurants dress code for mens is strict (long pants and closed shoes only)but not reinforced for woman's (shorts and tank tops accepted).
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,great beach to walk or run on no seaweed and not as rough as was stated in some reviews lots of activities to do if you wanted to rent some of the water equipment
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,Lots of people watching good food. Some of the merchants are pretty pushy. All in all a decent trip definitely worth seeing.
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,excellent beach pure white sand with palm trees scattered all around for shade the sea is excellent for all kinds of people young and old
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,Beautiful and clean beach. Lots of options for activities. Not crowded. Beach at Bavaro Princess was more spacious than other areas.
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,comfort  high quality service very good restaurants amenities beach and pool la Brisa restaurant Mexico lindo restaurant
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,Loved the big white sand beach and the blue water. I Could do without the seaweed but the rakers did a great job cleaning every day.
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,Nice and clean Beach  good for rest and good for fun  there is always something to do if you want  people friendly  easy to make friends 
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,Lots of beach and the water was warm. there are lots of beach activities too. seaweed was a small issue and there is always a little wave action but not enough for surfing or boogie boarding.
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,I stayed at Barceló Bavaro Beach - Adults Only and the beach was so beautiful and peaceful. The breeze that flows from the Beach is perfect. I could just lay out at the beach all day long and be alright. The water is clear and so pretty.
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,By far one of the worlds best. Te sand was so soft and clean...the water was so blue and clean. Amazing place to swim or walk.
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,Some parts of the beach are filled with seaweed while others are not. The beach goes on and on so you have plenty of miles to walk and see.
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,Enjoyed the beach and the personal service from the staff of the hotel and plenty of chairs available and activities.
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,Light sand so it did get hot but not too bad.. Seaweed would sometimes be overwhelming but they would come and rake it up early in the morning
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,The only thing I didn't like was the seaweed that has washed ashore. I wish that was cleaned away but other than then Bavaro Beach is an expansive Beach is absolutely beautiful with white sand and turquoise water.
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,Fab walking beach UNTIL you meet the dudes who want you to buy something. Some of them are soooo persistent that we turned around!
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,Powered white sand beach with fun loving people from all around the world. Had a great time at Genesis Bar & Grill for a bit to eat and a cold beer. Great music and watched the locals dance. Loved the entertainment and memorable moments.
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,white sandy beach  no waves  very calm ocean great for family and kids to enjoy. i wnr there with family on vacations and i will definitevely can reccomend bavaro beach.
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,Beautiful beach with an unending coast line. The water was extremely clear and beautiful. The currents were sometimes strong and in some spots it was deep.
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,Miles of beautiful warm turquoise water and palm coastline on the Atlantic where many resorts are located.
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,lots of seaweed water not very clear. sand was nice but the beach area was smaller and the water was not so great.
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,Bavaro Beach was beautiful especially when getting away from up north where I come from........the friendly supportive staff where I'd stay was always sweeping up the algae/seaweed that comes w/the territory. Caribe Club Princess was my stay. The staff is very hard working & always trying to please the customers. The beach was great!!!
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,This beach is one of the nices beaches in the Dominican...there's even shopping...parasailing not much snorkelling those but that was ok...
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,way to much seaweed to enjoy swimming. Had to navigate around the seaweed that eventually washed up on the beach
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,This beach had the nicest sand and clear aqua water the temp was really warm in May lots of seaweed would wash ashore most mornings but the resorts cleaned it up real quick nice to swim and very clean not a lot of vendors to bug you!
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,The Beach is so long that a walk first thing in the morning is a must. There are many hotels along this stretch so it does get busy but there is room for everyone Lovely golden sand and either gently lapping waves or lots of big waves it is different every day.
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,The beach is beautiful. Wonderful place for a vacation. I loved it. Crystal Clear water and nice beach breezes.
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 26 2016,This beach is the nicest beach I have been on. The sand is nice and very clean. Nice and long for beach walks.
g147293,d215733,February 25 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 25 2016,This beach will allow you to sunbathe or swim all your cares away. The soft sand between your toes and the crystal blue ocean allows you to daydream catch up on a good book or do the water excursion of your choice with ease. I will definitely be going back again.
g147293,d215733,February 25 2016,It is alwasy a great idea to see how the natives live. Being in the resorts is not life for the natives. We went to the school sugar cane fields cigar makinghorse back riding a village and had lunch with the locals. It is a great trip
g147293,d215733,February 25 2016,The sand was amazingly white and smooth the palm trees were so beautiful the water's reflection had different shades of blue.. Everything all together... breathtaking ! Just one thing.. In order to get the best experience it could be less crowded.

g147293,d215733,February 24 2016,Beautiful beach with many palm trees. It feels more natural than beaches in other countries because of the lush vegetation.

g147293,d215733,February 24 2016,The ware is warm and beautiful. There alway seems to be such nice people to meet there. I have to say that the beach seems to have undergone some erosion over the past year. I hope that it doesn't continue to get worse.

g147293,d215733,February 24 2016,The sand is like powder the sea weed can be off putting though swept continually a net through the sea would improve it. Enjoyed the chat with the lads on the Shopping Arcade good fun bargaining. Could describe it as lively noisy or vibrant.
g147293,d215733,February 24 2016,Amazing how the beach and first part of bed in sea changes daily. One day you can walk straight into sea sand is flat next day ruts appear.

g147293,d215733,February 24 2016,Lots of waves which can make it fun. The water temperature is good especially with such a hot day. Once you get in if you're a beach lover you'll have a hard time wanting to come out.
g147293,d215733,February 24 2016,Great beach that was soft and beautiful. Lovely to enjoy The waves were sometimes strong but manageable. You could walk out a good distance.
g147293,d215733,February 24 2016,It was OK but you can find better beaches. Lots of people in this area of Punta Cana. Excellent resorts... with SUPER pools! I prefer other beaches to this one.
g147293,d215733,February 24 2016,We love walking the beach and did about 4 miles a day. We'd take a little dip on the way and loved the swells.
g147293,d215733,February 24 2016,Waves and more waves! Fun in the surf. Soft and clean sand. Hotel took away seaweed. Water area was smooth on bottom. No rough stones or shells.

g147293,d215733,February 24 2016,The water is very rough here with the strong currants you can be pulled in the water but the beach in general is beautiful.
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,The softest smoothest sand you'll find. Almost white in colour with no shells or grit. Even out in water> SO NICE. Sure some debris gets washed up but resorts keep it relatively cleaned up.
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,Incredible beach with a great area to walk and the sand is like sugar. The water changes colors depending on the time of day. Just incredible.
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,Just make sure you chose a sunny day and low tide as sometimes the waters get too murky or high to see the animals properly. Excellent staff and quite clean!

g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,I loved the beach a lot of people said the seaweed was really bad but I have to say it wasn't it was so clean I am assuming the workers were out there cleaning it up every day. The sand was so very soft and white the water was such a beautiful colour. I will never forget it. Amazing beach!
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,

g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,Great beach with great views. We were rarely interrupted by vendors and the weather was excellent. The availability of lounge chairs were limited and you had to get early as most were taken.
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,The beach is a solid 5 star as having seen beaches in Jamaica and Mexico Bavaro beach is still our favourite one can literally walk for miles on white sand beside the most beautiful aquamarine sea.
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,It was nice to walk the beach but you had to fight off all the sales people trying to sell and draw you into their stores or Time Share places.
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,Great beach with soft sand. Lots of seaweed if the hotel doesn't clean it! The sand does get hot so make sure to where shoes!
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,We loved the beach views - just ocean and sand for miles. We didnt love the parasailing and helicopter tours all over the place.
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,Clear warm water. Clean beach with plenty to do. Watch out for that wicked sun. There are a few vendors on the beach but a sharp "no" takes care of them. You can walk for miles.
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,

g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,A lovely beach the water was inviting and you could walk for a great distance it was free of insects as was the area my wife always has to spray herself to keep the bugs away but not here. The sand was lovely to walk on great setting.
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,nice and clean .. maintenance kept seeweed and debris cleared every day .. gret for walking and not to many vendors selling letting you enjoy the scenery and waves..
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,Loved the paradisius resort everything was great the staff the food and the beach was absolutely beautiful pictures do no justice....
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,Best beach i have ever been to- i think they spray the beaches with insect repellant- the water is gorgeous and blue green and just amazing.
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,Pretty windy while we were there creating a lot of debris in the water along the beach. Workers kept the beach cleared. Water is gorgeous
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,Traveled to Secrets Royal Beach on Bavaro Beach and it was a great place would recommend to anyone.
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,Spend seven days right on Bavaro Beach in Catalonia Bavaro and hands down one of the best beaches out there. 25 minute walk on the beach would take us to a little town where you can enjoy a great food and super friendly locals.
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,Lots of boats in the water all day long. Noise prevented it from being a relaxing experience. Lots of seaweed on the beach but they did rake it up every morning.
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,The beach was steps from our Resort and Palm tree dotted with plenty of places to sit in the shade or the sun. Water is not as warm as other Caribbean beaches but very calm water and great sunrises.
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,Been to Bavaro Beach 4 times and every time we go it never cease to amaze us just how beautiful a beach can be. No boat shoes needed here. The sand is soft and the water is warm. Will make you dream about it when you go home.
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,The Mrs. and I went on two excursions based at Bavaro beach. One day we went snorkeling and diving in the ocean and the next day we went horseback riding on the beach. Great time.
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,Nothing like a riu palace and you can hit all the Riu if you get a pass for the palace great people and I would come to the bavaro before the punta cana one
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,Lovely wide beach with beautiful clear waters even with the odd large wave! We loved having a walk along the beach and spotted some lovely natural lagoons when the tide was out.
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,don't dig your feet into the sand as many sand mite are nesting and beware the strong current in the ocean I was wiped out a few times 
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,beautiful tranquil beach with calm seas - ust be careful of locals so keep your valuables safe even though it is a private beach.
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,Nice clean turquoise color water no sea weeds. Perfect water temperature. No big waves when we were there this past March 2015. Perfect beach!
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,This is a beautiful place - long golden beaches turquoise seas swaying palm trees - you can just relax or swim or walk for miles - it is idyllic. For the purists the only negative is a lot of seaweed but you just avoid it and don't let it bother you.
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,I could not get enough of this beach! It was particularly well kept around the Ambar Hotel section and the water was unbelievably clear warm and blue! The wash can be quite strong so young children or inexperienced swimmers should be looked after.
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,The beach was just fabulous it was clean No SEAWEED - the sand was soft and white. The water was very comfortable. Little waves - easy to get right in.
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,Liked the friendly people...liked the pretty beaches...rooms were terrible a lot of problems with our room from the moment we got there the staff was very friendly and helpful
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,Beautiful beach a bit rough because of the boats but that is minor compared to the beauty of this beach
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,This is an excellent beach in most places. I've been out on it in front of Dreams Palm Beach Iberostar Grand Paraiso and Hard Rock Punta Cana. Great for walking but watch out it is topless. :)
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,Lovedd the beach! It was clean of seaweed for the most part - and if it wasnt completely clean you constantly saw workers out there attempting to collect it all! We walked the beach daily up and down along the
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,Bavaro beach is one of the most beautiful beaches that I have ever visited. Our family would return to Punta Cana just because of the blue waters and soft sand.
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,Water was a bit putting off because of the sea weed. The walks were super and the beach was very safe. No hawkers
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,The beach view was wonderful but the seaweed was horrible. Regardless we had a wonderful visit and the service at Paridisus Palma Real was wonderful!
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,Bavaro Beach is a gorgeous white sandy beach not too far from the airport. We walked for miles and met so many people from all over the world. A lot of guys were body surfing and many people were swimming.
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,Paradise is the one word which best describes beautiful Bavaro Beach in Punta Cana..the people are friendly and not too many vendors as well.
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,Although not as impressive as the beach in Playacar Mexico This beach is very nice. It is clean Plenty of Palm trees for shade and the ocean lovely shades of blue. There is seaweed each morning but this is cleared up by the hotels. Worth getting up early to watch the sunrise .
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,Easily accessible nice place to walk the beaches watch or participate in all the water activities going on but can get a little busy at times as in most good beaches.
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,we had a great time. A relaxing holiday. Good food choices lovely beach friendly staff. Good entertainment plenty of lovely sand sun and sea....enough sun beds for everyone....lots of lovely cocktails to try...
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,We spent Easter week on Bavaro Beach. It was our first trip to the Dom Rep. We will definitely be going back.
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,Service people food everything is great I read bad reviews but people like to complain about anything. The place is great and some employees do not speak English but they try really hard to help you.
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,Warm water that had a lot of algae/seaweed. It wasn't in every location so you could still enjoy the water.
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,Sandy clean white and attractive beautiful beach. I was amazed by the beautiful beach that I had the opportunity to be around anfd walk on daily.
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,The hotel chain Iberostar cleans up the beach everyday to keep an echo friendly environment. White sand and a lot of space gives everybody the opportunity to enjoy this beautiful place.
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,You can walk for miles. Some vendors but not an issue. White sand and beautiful ocean . Colors amazing
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,Clear water soft white sand family friendly except the ONE topless lady who didn't respect the cultural norms not to go topless.
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,i have been to Cayman Negril Bahamas and Bavaro beach ranks right up there with the Cayman! the beatiful turquoise water is breath taking
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,walking on the beach and in the ocean was like a foot massage. The water was very warm and crystal clear blue.
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,Room was very clean beach was kept clean. Lots of greenery. Food was great and staff were vey friendly. We would definitely go back.
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,Beaches are packed and not a lot of room. Hard to exercise on beach. Water is beautiful but there are prettier beaches.
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,Very beautiful beach. Enjoyed our day there. The beach was very clean and enjoyable. Nice area of Punta Cana.
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,Had a bit of seaweed wash up but Catalonia resort staff worked hard all day every day to keep it at bay and did a great job!
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,The beach was awesome and so was the pool area as well as swim up bar. Though the resort is large and you may not be near the beach the shuttles are constantly running  you don't have to wait more than 5 minutes
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,sea weed is unstoppable. ocean is strong lots of boats around so dirty water and smell from gasoline is pretty bad
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,Yes and yes. This was a great beach! The locals don't go here but it's fun to see all the hotel guests try to achieve the perfect skin burn. Funny funny.
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,The nicest beach i have set my feet on! beautiful fine white sand with no pebbles or stones. Beautiful clear water.
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,Beautiful white sand beach. Among one of the most beautiful beaches in the world..you will not be dissapointed
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,I am speechless. This beach is beautiful. It was a bit windy and water was a bit rough. There was some seaweed but overall the experience was awesome.
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,Sand was great good waves and great water. Vendors were around all the time and took a while to go away.
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,Beautiful Turquoise water. Stayed at Vista Sol on Bavaro beach. Very secure. Felt safe the entire trip. Enjoy!!
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,No rocks rolling little waves very little seaweed warm blue water and sand and soft and smooth like brown sugar.
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,Over the years visited several times Bavaro Beach resorts last one was December 2014. One more time we were pleased. There is no wrong with this beach weather was perfect warm waters clean and white sand. Just the perfect joy.
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,Loved this beach its now on my fav list of beaches and you must check out the shopping on the beach if you like shopping like I do cute little shacks right on the water like a flea market!!
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,beautiful very walkable sand that goes on for several miles in each direction along with beautiful water
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,hard to get a chair unless you marked it by 7am otherwise people had them all reserved resort itself was beautiful and very well kept beautiful colors
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,Felix at Scubacaribe set up the perfect ocean package. Our restaurant experience with Luis Mareno Fransisco and Jose Alberto were the best waiters. Pache the pool bartender was fast and fabulous. Our room was beautiful and pristine. We'll definitely come again! Many thanks to all the staff for their friendly exceptional service.
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,Bavaro Beach is lively and beautiful and fun! We had a great time and met so many people from everywhere.
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,Very relaxing great service for the bar close to a restaurant we didnt have to leave the beach all day.
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,The view at the beach was awesome. We liked the fact that you could walk a good distance without too much hassle from local merchants.
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,Loved this beach because I could be comfortable in the shade. Had great service for towels drinks and making sure I had everything I wanted.
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,The beach has the finest sand I have ever experienced. While there is a daily cleanup of sea weed the water is warm and gentle.
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,Sugar white sand and turquoise warm gentle water..... What more do you want :) Oh yes the lovely palm tress for shade - Check
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,Beaches are very nice and lots of water sports activities. Snorkling is great. Needs a clean up a bit in the beach area
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,This beautiful beach offers not only sunbathing and swimming but also excellent conditions for fitness walking or jogging (and it is really used by hundreds tourists this way). Inclination of the beach is very gradual fine-grinned sand is firm in the wet zone – perfect for barefoot. You can do for your health!
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,The problem for tourists renting condo apartments in other words not staying in all inclusive hotel is the following : there is almost no public beaches for these people to bring their chairs blankets and lay on the beach. Most areas of public beaches are occupied by locals who rent chairs per day for a way too much price!
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,Best beach in area Was very nice and close to water. Not much sea weed and. Picture view of ocean we thought it was a fake view
g147293,d215733,February 23 2016,Beautiful beach but some hotelswerent as clean on the beach area as the paradisus was. Meaning seaweed and localswere very annoying bugging you when we walked by shops
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,The beach itself is beautiful perfect ocean and white sand! But if you stray from your hotel area the local shop owners will be very aggressive with you trying to get you into their shops.
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,Food was great weather perfect people couldn't be nicer to all of us would come back for sure they always knew are names five of us
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,You won't need an umbrella as the beach is full with palm trees .sparkling clear water ....white Sandy beach just gorgeous!
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,I do not think there's much you can add to what's have been said about Bavaro Beach. The place is a paradise lots of people lots of activities. You can not go wrong with Bavaro.
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,Best sand around but beware if you are a sea shell hunter.... there is a reef a ways out so the waves are not bad and the shells are hard to find
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,soft sand crystal waters and blue skies made getting 10000 steps in a breeze. An every moring pre-breakfast ritual.
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,You can walk forever on this beach and never get tired of the beauty!! On the far end around the point the waves are rough and it's not recommended to swim but it is lovely to watch them roll and crash. On the other side near Majestic Elegance it's calm enough to swim.
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,This was the beach our resort was on white powdery deep sand. There is a lot of seaweed in the water but the guys on the beach kept it cleaned up as best they could. Water could be a smidge cold but it was March after all.
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,Beaches and water are beautiful. The waves were fun to play in and just float up and down with the surf. Lots of fun activities if interested. Nice huts with shade if preferred.
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,The many people offering Massage shopping items and different attractions are sometimes a réal négative
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,Too many people bothering you. We stayed by the pool. Much nicer time. Close to food and most importantly the bar.
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,The blue/teal color of the ocean is breathtaking. There is quite a bit of seaweed that washes up onto the beach but our resort was good about cleaning it every morning so it wasn't as big of an issue. Nice sand good waves. Would visit again!
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,Beautiful Sands water is amazing! Lots of room on beach doesn't fall off like in Mexico. Our favourite Beach of all destinations
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,Very safe. No people trying to sell you a bunch of stuff. Tourist police walk along the sand. Not too overcrowded. But not too many dining options.
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,Has seaweed in mrnings but the workers are up early to have it raked up.white sand para sailing available.
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,Beach was awesome rum was fantastic resort was well maintained but the food left much to be desired!
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,White sand beach very safe lovely swimming turquoise sea something for everyone watersport facilities
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,Only visited when taking a Day trip by boat out to Snorkel and Scuba. But the Sand was perfectly white and not to much seaweed. There was a mall on the beach (pretty cool - although did not go to it) - Seemed like lots of ways to keep occupied
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,Bavaro Beach is absolutely beautiful! Clear water clean sand. We walked 5kms to the left of the hotel and 5kms to the right. Saw many other resorts but nothing like the Bavaro Princess.
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,Probably one of the best beaches I've ever visited...it is comparable (close but these 2 edge out Bavaro Beach) to Turks and Caicos' Grace Bay and Aruba's Manchego Beach!
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,Nobody tried selling on beach which was nice. The sand was very white and nice. Sports employees got tourists involved if wished in fun activities on beach. Took the water aerobics which was good. Very safe to walk on beach during day. Did not go at night.
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,We have stayed in many resorts on Bavaro Beach during the last 20 years and all of them were appreciated. We are beach people and spent a lot of our time in the ocean or walking the clean white sandy beaches with the waves lapping at our feet. It was heavenly!
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,Loved the fact that the staff cleaned the sand of your feet and chairs. There were always enough chairs and palapas for everyone.
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,Quietrelaxing great staff warm weather decent food great drinks pool and buffet staff could use some more English lesson's
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,This is a very popular beach. There is always seaweed; however the beach is beautiful. You always have an Eastward wind blowing off the Atlantic.
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,The beach is so beautiful water isn't too rough. Even though there are resorts along it it isn't too crowded as all the chairs are not too close to the water.
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,We walked 5 miles roundtrip to the North and about 3 miles roundtrip to the south of our hotel Bavaro was the best!
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,Beach is beautiful but there is a lot of seaweed. The beach wasn't that busy when we were there. When we were there the kids from spring break we partying but left by the weekend so it wasn't too busy.
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,The beach was beautiful! Wear sunblock the sun is powerful. The water was beautiful and was very refreshing. We had a great trip and loved wiggling our toes in the soft powder like sand.
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,Amazing white clean beaches no rocks gorgeous scenery. There are lightly breaking waves that give it that nice relaxing sound and enough to play in the water a bit. Very enjoyable! :)
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,We have been to this beach many times in various resorts. We love the waves and to be able to walk miles. It is definitely our favourite beach.
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,The beach was fabulous. Stayed at the hard rock and had plenty of seating. Wait staff was hard to flag down just as they were by the pool but the views were worth it. Clean BIG beach barely any shells. Plenty of space to walk on the beach or play sand volleyball or soccer. Amazing!
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,Great place to meet people from all over the world but if you want a quieter beach this may not be for you.
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,Enjoyed it tremendously.... nice package beautiful views beautiful and friendly people great experience!!!! Bring underwater camera for the great experience you'll have with snuba and snorkeling.
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,Hours of walking on white sandy beaches with turquise waters. Walk by shops beach taverns and Caribbean street
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,Great beach beautiful water and lots of chairs and activities. Very few solicitors trying to sell goods
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,Too many vendors bothering you to buy trinkets. If you say a polite no they should take that as a polite no and move on but they don't.
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,Nice looking beach with plenty of sand and sunshine located in the touristy section of D.R. The problem with this beach is when you enter the water a thin layer of sand camouflages the rocks underneath the sand which can be quite painful when stepped upon.
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,A beautiful beach to enjoy for a week. Water was warm & I loved listening to the waves crash. Seaweed is abundant but doesn't bother me. A good beach to play & boogie board in.
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,This is not the crystal clear turquoise waters that you dream of. The water was really gross the beach is just okay. The worst part about Babaro - the solicitation! I was offered both sex and drugs. Never again!
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,We stayed at Ocean Blue and Sand in Bavaro.The beach is long and curving but nothing special.Wave and quite easily knock people overnot so good for small children.Aronnd midday the sea starts to bring in lots of seaweed that then lays on the beach.If you are hoping for lovely calm waters gently lapping the sandforget it
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,My wife and I stayed at a resort on this beach. It was clean soft and the water was warm. The hotels do a great job at keeping the non-hotel vendors away and overall we weren't bothered too much. Once of the best beaches I've had the pleasure of staying on.
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,Beautiful beach even when they do not clear away the seaweed! When we were there in Feb it was lovely clear turquoise water.
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,awesome beach just perfect for jumping waves. we had a lot of fun! we brought tubes and used them to play in the waves!
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,I spent most of my time swimming nice big waves nice temperature no obvious life not a single thing comes to shore not a shell not nothing but seaweed but it was not too too bad. too many Helicopter tours directly overhead. loud and not relaxing.
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,BEAUTIFUL! Sand is like icing sugar. Pictures cannot capture the glorious colours and the feeling you get when you are there!
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,the only thing I enjoyed was the beach the water is amazing right by the pool its a shame that the customer service sucks
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,This place was an absolute paradise. Any time you have your toes buried in white soft sand looking out over calm crystal blue water life is great !!!
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,The sand was soft and white the water was warm the view was breathtaking and the service top notch.
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,This is the most beautiful beach. . .post card perfect. The water is calm and inviting. The sand is warm never too hot.
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,Nice beach but a lot of vendors hounding you. Bring ipod to listen to so they dont bother you. Great beach for a walk!
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,The beach was very clean. The only drawback was that they really did not have staff going around to order drinks. Food was good in the restaurant. Snack shop was just ok. Good security on the beach.
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,Amazing beach with white sand and blue water I enjoyed because of long stretched walking area less crowded and very few hustler's. Not the best beach though compare to other Caribbean beaches.
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,Every detail was there. Great food and Wonderful People.the Adults Only was Great for peace & Relaxing. you can go to the Family Side & take in the Restaurants and the Water Park is lots of Fun. ❤️ You would Not be disappointed.
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,fun relaxing beach. lots of local sales guys selling anything you can think of... that was annoying. tell them no thanks with a smile and most will leave you alone. lots of seaweed too. was't expecting that.. water is warm and clear. beaches are nice smooth sand. tons of all inclusive resorts.
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,service was excellent staff friendly customer service GREAT and the BEACH was awsome ..Food and drinks special....
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,The waters are baby blue with white powder sand under your feet palm tree's galore and the soothing wind coming off the waters are so refreshing and calming Life's a Beach
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,Beautiful beach fantastic way to wind down with a walk down the beach with the sun on your back & a quick dip in the crystal clear ocean.
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,There was nothing to dislike. Just love it here. This is our second visit and by no means our last. Such choice in food as you can dine at the adjoining hotel too. Entertainment is nightly and first class and there are activities going on all day every day.
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,This beach is absolutely beautiful. We have been to a lot of beach resorts but Bavaro Beach is one of the best. The coral sea weed is heavy in some areas but just scooch down the beach a few feet and you can avoid it. This probably has to do with the time of the year as well.
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,Beach is stunning. Breathtaking. Turquoise ocean white sand (which is so soft because it is made of seashells). We stayed at Hard Rock Puntacana so our area of this beach was not a good swimming area but I will never forget the beauty of this beach!
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,It was one of the most beautiful beaches we have visited soft silky and sandy beach with emerald green water and miles and miles of interesting views from the beach.
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,The beach was perfect clean wonderful time with great friendly people who made sure you were having a wonderful time
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,lovely white sandy beach great for a long walk and the sea is warm great for the kidsat all so there are some shakes were you can buy some gifts
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,Beach was cleaned every day of sea weed and garbage beautiful and very large beach with lots of beach walking white powdery sand
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,Seaweed is in abundance - but the water is very clear - not good for snorkeling since not many fish in this area
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,a beautiful long beach of fine white sand extending into the warm clear turqoise warm ocean with gentel waves lapping the shore.
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,We were given wristbands and the security guards did a good job protecting our resort section of the beach.
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,Beautiful!! Food and service were fantastic. Everybody part of Paradisus treated you like a jewel. Very safe and enjoyable every single event throughout the day
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,Perfect sand just easy to go in always some place with no see weed and the temperature his perfect great place to go
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,since the waves were so far the beach was dirty  and I got sand flea bites.there was never 1 chair available. no music or entertainement we only went to the beach once. since it was not interesting.
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,Bavaro Beach is beautiful with white sand and is miles long. We have never reached the end of this beach in either direction. In some areas there is a lot of seaweed but the resorts clean it daily. It is a pleasant and safe beach to walk or run.
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,Beach for as far as they eye can see with white perfectly clean sand as beautiful as Miss World!!!! - just avoid the traders!!!
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,The beach is nice but it is a little crowded. And if you are not staying at an all inclusive resort there really isn't anywhere to sit on the beach. There are also a lot of people trying to sell things.
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,Bavaro Beach was very nice but during February there was a lot of seaweed. The workers keep cleaning it every day but could not keep up. We were able to swim just in some areas. The waters were calm and it was very relaxing just to sit by the beach and enjoy the nice breeze and the palm trees.
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,Among all the other beaches we saw Bavaro Beach is the most beautiful beach we have ever been! Sunrise was amazing sunset was perfect.
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,highly reccomend it - really white caribbeat sand and turques ocean! we anjoyed the location every day. thank God the weather was good. swiming daily! all was super!
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,Softest sand I have ever felt! Beautiful water and a constant breeze blowing made it paradise!! Sat on the beach all day long every day!
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,The beach area at our resort was full of seaweed and the water was very murkier for swimming in even though crews were out every morning cleaning. To get the beautiful crystal clear waters we walked down the beach about 15 minutes to enjoy swimming in lovely water.
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,Very nice beach very long great sand wonderful water and abundant activities to do. Parasailing was great but I was only able to overcome my fear after about 6 drinks.
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,There is some good snorkeling around the broken up reef. Coral is dead but still plenty of fish to see. Beach is very well maintained.
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,The number of people trying to sell you something detracted from enjoying the visit. There was a stark contrast from the many luxurious resorts which ensured that no outsiders could sell their wares with our permission. Outside of the resorts you were on your own and that was very apparent.
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,Dominican Republic has the most beutiful beaches. Bavaro is one of them. White sand blue cristal water. Excellent for family vacations couples friends. Bavaro have a lot of good All Inclusive Hotels.
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,Very clean. Waves were not bad. Short walk to local markets. Not the best snorkeling. Not very deep for swimming.
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,This beach is fantastic. Beautiful and soft white sand and the water is warm. It is quite rough though (which makes it fun to play in) so you must be careful.
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,There were plenty of places to lounge. You had the choice of beach swimming or pool swimming. There was food around the corner or swim up bar. Awesome weather where you can actually enjoy the beach without getting over heated.
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,the beach was beautiful. some days it was pretty crowed but it was spring break. lots of shade and sun so that was good for us as we spent lots of time there. bar close and food too! LOVED it!!
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,came here on a day trip we booked the beach and sea was amazing would of liked to stay a bit longer but was on a buggy trip so had to rush sadly
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,All I can say is PARADISE you won't be disappointed at all it's got to be up there with the best beaches only one downside for some people could be that the sea can be very choppy but this added to the fun for us jumping the waves
g147293,d215733,February 22 2016,We went here on our honeymoon! Beautiful grounds and very clean. Perfect postcard pictures. Check out the parasailing vendors on the beach. Great views!!
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,This beach has a lot of seaweed but it is nice if you get a kayak and go farther. The water has a nice temperature and some places are really shallow and good to swim
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,It was a rainy day when we visit the beach but still beautiful. We only had 2 days in Punta Cana. But I really need to go back.
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,Love this beach because of the packed sand the length which makes it great for really long walks if you want while stopping to go in for a swim or play in the waves along the way. Very clean! We have returned here several times over the years for this reason.
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,Bavaro Beach is by far the cleanest beach in Punta Cana. It is an amazing stretch of beach with Flea markets on both ends.
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,Too much seaweed. The staff made an effort to clean it up every morning but it was just too much. Overall nice place to go and relax.
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,we loved this beach. gorgeous. great for snorkeling. excellent view of the ocean and the water was warm
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,One of the best beaches DM..great for long walks. Just be careful if you are walking by yourself to not walk in deserted areas as I have friends that got mugged of all their personal belongings from locals hiding in the wooded areas in deserted stretch of beach between resorts.
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,really nice beach and it is good for walking and a lot of people even run on this beach and also good for snorkling and swiming
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,like: food beachpersonnalservice disliked: room can't sleep office in block i stay room not very good for a price I have 15 travels I make with Transat or Nolitours so check your room do you have when you make a reservation...
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,You walk is endless there! You walk on nice gold sand. And no wind ! Quet breeze and beutifull tropical birds flying above you. Just a paradise...
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,a lot of seaweed and if they had a rake on the back of the tractor it would be better overall the ocean was warmer than the pool
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,a very big beach area but could use more chairs when busy season and dislike the peddlers on the beach should not be allowed
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,The beach was nice to walk because of its length. Lots of nice scenery too - both human and surroundings. The market is high pressure but great items for sale. Our hotel was here ironically we didn't spend as much time on this beach. I suggest checking out other beaches regardless of country. No complains on this one.
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,It was outstanding great sand and surf views spectacular water clean and just the right temp.very relaxing w yet plenty of activities.
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,Good View terrible hotel staff and accommodations! Our credit cards and cash stolen from our room safe boxes! including our friends from different room! the same thing happened to them!
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,Traveled with a group of friends and partied everyday and night. Fun time. Beach is beautiful and the pool is great. The bars are very accommodating. Even with a rainy day we rode the tram all around and met the neatest people. And stopping at the bars for refills.
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,Beautiful beach you can walk for miles & never reach the end! The colors of the ocean were gorgeous. So clean nothing washed up but a little seaweed each day.
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,Lovely place to stay especially if you bring the kids and grandchildren. Food is not so great. Love the idea of staying in adults only and visiting the kids by trolley. Nice golf course.
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,warm clear waters. can go out far and can swim easily. beautiful white clean sands. Stayed at Bavaro Princess All Suites and Spa Resort and their beaches beautiful especially Platinum Beach. Local dancers and singers on the beach and vendors but they don't haggle you.
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,way too busy on the beach and water poor access via the roads town is authentic good insight into how the locals live
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,The beach is stunning but the waves can be very rough on windy days so children should be supervised and check the lifeguard flags
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,This is an excellent beach. You can take long walksswim feel a nice warm wind or just lay down and take in the sun rays. You can also snorkel and do boating.
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,At Barceló Bavarro resort.....incredible stretch of beach with pure white sand mature palm trees wide beach area and lots of room to wade out in shallow water.
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,The Caribbean Sea had calmer water. Waves too choppy at Bavaro Beach. Couldn't sign up for any water excursions because of the waves. Sunlight was good... Great trees.
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,Miles and Miles of white sand. Perfectly safe for walking swimming. Very clean. There are markets for souvenirs if you are looking for them. If not interested in purchasing just keep walking by. There were no issues.
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,I absolutely loved this beach! The green water was the most beautiful I have seen. I also felt very safe on this property day or night.
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,the most beautiful beach and sand I have ever seen. there wasn't a rock or shell anywhere. You could walk and see for miles.
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,We won a trip to Hard Rock Punta Cana... this beach was GORGEOUS and so much fun!!! Gorgeous sand and clear water!!!
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,Beautiful beach clear water nice white sand. Security was present. Ran into a few local peddlers but they weren't aggressive. Just acknowledge them and say no thank you. Felt completely safe
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,This beach was very nice! The sand is soft and you can walk out on the sand bar which is a lot of fun! There were tons of coral reefs around which you could swim overtop of with a snorkel and mask! I loved that there were trees on the beach that provided shade throughout the day!
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,A Beautiful Sandy beach that is great for walking and jogging. Soft sand and many all-inclusives and hotels along the way. Water clearer in some areas more than others. Some areas have an abundance of seaweed.
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,Beach was great cleaned everyday of seaweed and visible security. Lots of free water sports and snorkeling was good. Friendly staff and very comfortable.
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,Long stretch of beach which you could walk and see all the different resorts along the way. Soft sand and warm turquoise water just beautiful!
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,The South East trade wind constantly blows at 20+ knts. The water is rough and swimming is not pleasant.
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,Soft sandgradual decent to crystal clear water. Great for beach walking and sunning. Great for the little ones to run and dig with their beach toys
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,Nice sand and clean beach. Not as nice as some of Cuba's beaches but very nice. Waves are great for the kids and boogie boarding. Lots of beach front and you can walk for hours if you wish.
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,All the resorts were great at cleaning the seaweed form the beach daily so one could walk the beach easily
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,relaxing but safe to swim the only dislike hassle from people wanting you to shop i just said no thank you and carried along on beach
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,Bavaro Beach was picture perfect. Clean white-sand beach clear blue water and great activities. We stayed at the wonderful Barceló Bavaro Premium Deluxe Resort and had wonderful accomodations with friendly staff.
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,Needs to get rid of local peddlers! I was offered drugs cigars massages with optional sex by drop dead georgeous young women.
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,Long stretch of beautiful pretty clean  turquoise water beach. Great for walking. Water clean and not too deep great for just bouncing around.
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,Idyllic looking beach with palm trees and white sand. Watersports available (some free at our hotel.) Water a bit murky for the first few metres then clears Fantastic weather!
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,Beautiful white sandy beach that stretched as far as the eye could see. Felt safe when taking a long walk.
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,Where we stayed there was almost endless beach to walk to the left or to the right. The beach to the water walk was very smooth no staggering or abrupt terrain.
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,Great for snorkeling! Amazing white sand beautiful palm trees and clean! You can put a towel down on one of their lounge chairs and it stays there for the entire day no one touched our spot!
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,Loved the palm trees...loved the white sand and the turquoise water...beautiful. Loved watching the parasailers. Loved being able to get paella cooked right on the beach. Everything was so clean and beautiful.
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,Liked everything about the beach. it was clean and had no seaweed on it. You could walk miles up and down the beach.
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,Beautiful cool white sand warm water easy to swim. Staff at Royalton worked very hard to pick up any seaweed that washed up (which was minimal).
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,Bavaro beach is the most beautiful beach Ive ever been too. Ive traveled most carribean Islands and none compare to the pink silky sand and calm blue/green water.
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,Nice but always lots of waves and water gets dirtythey do clean the beach of what is washed to sure witch is nice.
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,We had a blast swimming with the fish offshore. Watched Humpback whales surfacing from our sun chairs.
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,nice beach to walk along and people watch or just watch the surf but not very idyllic. there are some beach shacks where the locals sell their wares. didnt see much of the seaweed that alot of people on tripadvisor had mentioned.
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,Too many sunbeds very close together but what do you expect for a complex housing 9000 guests!! Use of foul language by a large number of people so unnecessary!
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,Clean white great walking beautiful blue not too windy and lots of activity and action along the shore. Little shops too.
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,Beautiful sand and water and never too busy. Water was rarely to rough to swim in and they cleaned the seaweed off the beach each day.
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,The Bavaro beach is excellent for swimming water sports or just taking a long walk at sunset. I liked the way the mountains peek through the evening haze. This defines vacation...
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,beautiful Sandy beach. Walking every day was an awesome experience. Weren't bothered by vendors like a lot of beaches. If they did approach you they were courteous of your time and would always say thank you.
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,Very nice sand and sea is so warm . Just i dont like the local people always disturb u for selling something
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,Turquoise water warm a lot of seaweed can be rough crazy undertoe love the ocean just go and enjoy.
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,Walk for miles and miles of great sand warm surf many shades of aqua ocean..Full of tourists mostly but you never have that claustrophobic feeling.
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,beautiful sand great walk for miles down the beach. Tons of people though but worth the walk for some great photos and warm waters.
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,Waters were too rough pretty much every day. We could not let our kids play in the water as the waves knocked everyone over.

g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,Bavaro Beach is coconut tree lined with beautiful sand and wonderful warm water although not always flat it is just what you would expect from a Caribbean island.
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,Beach was good but seaweed a small problem maintenance clean everything good water was turquoise at some places and water warm no Waves lots of fishes
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,A lovely beach to take a long safe walk along the water. There was nothing to dislike about it. It was kept clean of seaweed so walking near shore was easy.
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,We came here for a day from Sanctuary Cap Cana - we wanted to check it out. We ate at Langosta Roja (Spanish for Red Lobster) close to Jellyfish Beach. The food/service was amazing!!!! Definitely would go back. The water at the beach can not be beat - so clear and the most beautiful aqua blue I've ever seen!
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,Beautiful beach and scenery and water. The workers try to keep it very clean as sometimes massive amounts of seaweed wash up but hey that's part of the beach scene!
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,Its a nice beach nothing else I have seen so many other beaches much better than this one. I would not go back to the Dominican Republic I thought it was paradise well it was a simple beach.
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,Typical Caribbean beach white sand warm water lots of water sports both free from your hotel and motorised ie parasail banana ringos to pay for.
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,Punta Cana is a great spot to enjoy the beach and the warm waters of the Dominican Republic. The locals are great to tourists and the beaches stretch for as far as the eye can see !
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,The beach was not nice at all this year. A lot of bad things in the water But the Barcelo bavaro beach was great
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,Great place many attractions definitely worth a visitWide choice of resorts and hotels and a lot to do or just simply relax
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,Some seaweed by secrets and now end but still beautiful. A walk either direction is a little different.
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,Long beach we walked for hours and just enjoyed the tropical feel. Sandy and picture perfect this is a beach meant for long lazy days relaxing. Would have stayed here for months but had to go home........
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,we love the long stretches of clean white sand beaches bordered by the turquoise water! Not so many people that you couldn't walk and talk no topless either!
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,Miles of white sand and palm trees; just what you always dreamed about. Lots of daily walkers fun beach bazars where you can haggle for souvenirs.
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,Sand was amazing water was great but no chairs the French tourist would take two chairs. also we were bombarded with locals selling souvenirs to the point we got mad one day.
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,Clean picturesque lots of water sports offered. A slice of heaven. Bring your sunscreen and you will be set for the day!
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,This is by far the best beach is all of DR. We have spoken to many people and this stretch of beach is tge best. You will not be disapointed.
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,Had a lovely time! The beach is absolutely stunning and there are a hundred activities you can book directly on the beach. Recommended!
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,Very crowded Beach. If you want a lounging chair early rise! Bars were a little too far when you wanted a beverage but we didn't mind..
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,Great place to visit great seafront location plenty to do if you want plenty of beach bars for food and drink
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,I think you can walk the entire beach we did a couple of miles. Tropical weather sure beat the Midwest.
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,During this time of the year (February 2015) seaweed on the beach is higher than usual. The water was a little cold and not crystal clear as I imagined.
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,soft pure sand no rocks or shells amazing warm turquoise water with shallow slope and easy surf for hanging out in. Most wonderful beach I have ever seen!
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,Not as pristine as Macaou Beach but very active great for walking big waves close to attractions like snorkling Dolphins the pirate show etc. quite a bit of seaweed sometimes.
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,This beach is exquisite. Water is perfect temp for swimming. I especially appreciate that the resort buildings along the beach are low and don't dominate the landscape. Most beaches are deep and unobstructed.
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,While popular it's generally not over crowded even during the day. The best is in the morning. There's a few stretches that seem less wavy and some parts have quite a bit of weeds.
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,Great beach for enjoying the day. Can get very crowded best to go early depending on the resort. Water is rougher than southern coasts. There is supposed to eat more fish here but our dives only found smaller animals
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,Bavaro Beach is beautiful white sand and the waves are gorgeous! We spent a lot of our vacation down at the beach and loved it!
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,Beautiful white sand. It is a long beach that literally allows you to walk for miles in either direction. It is safe for families and singles to walk with many resorts on the beach front.
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,This is a lovely beach - one of the nicest in the Caribbean...great for playing in the waves but leave your snorkel gear at home unless you plan an excursion as this is not a snorkel site :)
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,When in Punta Cana Domican Republic try to choose a hotel located on Bávaro Beach if you really want to know and fell the real Caribbean Sea.
g147293,d215733,February 21 2016,people everywhere can walk for ever was somewhat choppy for swimming but OK beach venders were present but were not overwhelming no thank meant no thank you
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,Bavaro Beach is just beautiful for a long walk. There are shops along the way where you can make deals on lovely sarongs and other items. One evening almost dark we were advised by security it was not the best idea to walk in the dark. We trusted his opinion and stayed in.
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,Bavaro beach was picturesque! Seriously one of the best beaches I have ever been too! No stones seashells or anything sharp to hurt your feet on. Simply amazing!!
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,Beautiful soft white sand  light blue water.. vendors aren't that pushy either .. I loved waking up to this beach every morning. The water was only a little rough one day after it rained.. but still nothing as rough as some of the state beaches I've been too...
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,Beautiful resort fantastic staff. If you love comfortable and clean rooms walking among gorgeous greenery and enjoying white sand and blue water this is the vacation for you.
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,The beach near the Iberostar Grand Bavaro has a lot of seaweed. If you walk closer to the Bavaro and Dominican the scene goes from spotted to clean and beautiful. The water is clearer and the sand is soft and white. There are vendors but they are not pushy.
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,the beach was very beautyfull. we had a period with a lot of seeweed But that is the nature no control on that and he rarely happen according to the people that visit often the sand was nice long beach It was very nice.
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,white powder sand great place to walk. It's a long beach with no stones/gravel. Hawkers were sometimes present but understood the word NO.
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,Enjoyed the beautiful fine white sand / easy for walking. Hot days with lots of sunshine. Light wind and cool down nights.
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,The beach is great for a long walk. the sand is amazingly soft. Always felt safe. Some vendors but not too pushy.
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,We love the beach and warm weather in February. Don't mind people selling stuff. They were okay with being told no thank you if you weren't interested.
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,I liked all the food all the entertainment the people and the beach. loved the hot weather. didn't like the room service.
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,Great beach for walking. Very safe and lined with resorts and plenty of things going on in the area. Plenty of chairs and Tiki huts provided by the Palma Royal. Area to swim was roped off.
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,The beach was beautiful. The water was so warm. There was not a lot of seaweed. I can't wait to go back!
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,Bavaro beach was unusually plagued by weed. Our hotel were excellent and cleared this away. Others weren't so good. Otherwise a lovely sandy beach. No pebbles or shells
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,Lots of sand and surf Best: Ocean waves and the beach is huge in length and a good distance from the water.
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,My husband and I walked up and down Bavaro Beach many times beautiful beach nice turquoise water fairly calm can't wait to return!
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,Beautiful beach great sand blue water pretty waves great coconuts lots of sun...worth visiting. you will like this beach
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,Great beach I heard complaints that there was lots of sea weed but we didn't notice much at all. Powedery sand and sunshine!
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,clear blue water sun perfect to relax get a wonderful sun tan lots of things to do deep sea fishing surfing restaurants other activities we really enjoy it
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,gets very busy midday and will not get a close spot near the beach if you get there late. Nice location would definitely stay there again.
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,Very crowded and it's hard to get a chair but the beach and water are beautiful and clean. Always an attendant cleaning the trash off the beach!
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,Beautiful hotel beach facilities food just the right place to enjoy holidays. The only annoying point is the loud animation team on the beach when you want to rest (but they are really friendly)
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,Bavaro beach was beautiful! The weather sights and atmosphere of this beach was perfect! At times I snuggled up with a book and other times with my friends and chilled! This was a beautiful back drop for pictures!
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,Spent 2 weeks relaxing on Bavaro Beach. This is a very beautiful Beach and very clean. A lot of seaweed in the mornings but the hotel staff do a great job of clearing each morning.
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,We stayed at Presidential Suites Punta Cana located in Bavaro and the beach was the prettiest we've ever seen
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,its just clear clean smooth sailing. out of the various area's our beach was the most free of seaweed and such.
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,One of the best travel experiences of my life. We will definitely return soon with all the family. This was always something we always wanted to do with the family. This has been the closest I'v been to paradises.
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,Must go here this place is beautiful white sand and stunning coconut trees. Nothing to complaint this is rate as one of the world top beach and I see why now.
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,Great for running walking and just relaxing in the white powder sand. The Platinum private club area is worth it the bar service there was beyond amazing.
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,Bavaro Beach was wonderful. Clean and warm and this was the first time we ever went to an adults only beach. It was great. Highly recommend it!
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,Scuba diving was good and the master divers were great. There is a ship wreck and some awesome caves for divers to explore.
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,great waves and beautiful colored ocean clean and white sand was great always a drink when you need one
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,Love the beach played volleyball for hours walked the shore everyday I was in country and enjoyed every bit of it
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,What's not to like - beautiful blue warm water. Plenty of sunshine to go around for all. Not a huge beach but big enough to walk and enjoy.
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,Lovely beach soft white sand and you can ride / run / walk for miles. There were a lot of seaweed but still a lovely ocean to swim in and great waves to play in.
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,over crowed for sure. must get chairs at 6am every morning way to many people on this beach that's for sure. Stay some where else 100%
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,The beach was very nice to lay on or go for a walk. There were other resorts along the way. Felt very safe.
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,Like it Steps from our room to miles of beach that were not crowded or had many vendors. Disliked some seaweed in the water
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,Loved it.... Nice to run on. good for a nice walk. A little sea weed but nothing too major. would go back in a heart beat.
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,No dislikes and liked everything about the place It is like being in HeavenIf you want to relax you can if you want to do something you can there is nothing to dislike about this place. enjoy your self and have fun and do what you want to as long as it's legal
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,It was a very long beautiful beach. Great for walkers and hikers. The seaweed was bad the first three days but they cleaned it up.
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,Everything you want from a beach. Very nice with perfect water and sand. Even the shoppers can find some locals with turist shops in one end of the beach.
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,Seaweed is there but certainly not an issue for us. You can walk for a long way and eventually reach the vendors. They can be intimidating but just relax and enjoy.
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,We went on the reef excursion here. Swam on the reefs ocean kayak snorkeled got to hold a stingray. Very relaxing day. They had a wide variety of activities to choose from. Paddle boarding kayaking snorkeling even a massage as well as healthy drinks and snacks.
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,Food selection was good but food was not that good for a resort like this. I would expect a little better tasting food in a luxury resort as this
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,Food was greatservice was fast.wings and nachos were great.staff was always quick and willing to please. I was extremely satisfied.
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,The beach was awesome very clean lots of chairs and very relaxing whether you wanted to be in the sun or shade or a little of both :-)
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,The beach is pretty standard. I guess it change from one resort to another. The specific one where we stayed was pretty dirty.
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,Loved the beautiful blue and warm waters! Also this beach is protected by the reef so on windy days the waves break far away leaving it calm near the shore! I did dislike that nudity is allowed as it is something I am not used to.
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,Lovely beach soft white sand and you can walk for miles. Shame about the seaweed but still a lovely ocean to swim in.
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,The sand was white and fine...the water was clear and clean. I loved the morning waves! There wasn't a day we didn't swim in the ocean...and spending time walking along the beach was romantic and beautiful.
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,We have been to Punta Cana several times and have never experienced the seaweed that we did this week. Apparently some offshore storms caused the seaweed on the beach to be heavier than normal - and we can attest to that.
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,Powder sand was great but where we were is was very crowded. Stay away from the areas that have entertainment as they are very loud
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,Were staying in an adults only hotel therefore appeared much livlier but if we were bringing our grandchildren it may be a good place to stay
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,not too many people in January. Good time to go but a little breezy . need to bring own towel with u to beach as the hotel towels run out very quickly even when hotel not full. Hotel was Grand Bahia Principe Bavaro
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,lovely white sand beach turquoise water and shady palms. The water can be rough but it all depends on the weather. We encountered lots of seaweed but they had crews out to clean it up.
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,Maybe it was the time of year but there was lots of sea weed washing up. Other than that the sand was very fine and the water was clear and beautiful turquoise/green. :)
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,The sand was like talcum powder and the sea was as warm as bath water that was a beautiful turquoise colour. Very clean and barely any seaweed washed ashore.
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,You can walk this beautiful beach for miles ! This year there is a lot of sea weed but it is still amazing . Great water to bounce in the waves!
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,we stayed at the Iberostar Bavaro a few times and just love it there....the water is calm and perfect...hotel staff was attentive and fun so if you just need to chill outhtis is the place...
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,Beautiful beach... Beautiful Water... Beautiful sunrises... After a storm...the seaweed really adds up.
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,We were in an "adults only" area and it was very nice. The property only allows the locals to sell their wares once a day on the water so were weren't constantly bombarded. The small shopping district was fun. Lots of security at night - so we left before sundown. Felt safe the entire time.
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,Highly recommend this beach! It's clear and perfect to spend a vacation on! They have markets and many water sports to do on the beach too!
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,clean white sandy beach the water is clear there are locally run huts along the beach and you can walk for miles.
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,The colors of the water were beautiful. There was quite a bit of seaweed one day but the resort quickly took care of it.
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,nice beach but lots of weeds...they do not clean very much therefore you have to step on the weeds to get into the ocean....
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,I like the workers Ciarisa...Wilson ...Yolanda ...food was good and people were very friendly...weather was great ...and there were many things to do
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,White soft sandsome bad areas of seaweed.A bit contested in areastoo many people hogging up cabana shelters and then not using in a timely manner.
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,The beach is beautiful but could be windy at times. Depending on the current and wind there might be sea weeds on the beach. Some resorts will clean up in front of their own area but some not.
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,Wow I finally got in the water. It was so crystal clear. Beautiful. My husband and I had a blast at the beach. We will definitely make this our vacation spot next year.
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,Beach/Sea Water full of Sea weed/Grass it's on the Atlantic Ocean so The sea is very rough most of the time.and windy many beach pedlars pestering you selling trips ect.
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,Loved the beach! There was a storm one night and tons of seaweed the next morning but 10 guys worked hard all day to clean it. Been to many beaches and this one does rate high on the list. Just make sure to have a really good resort to relax in.
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,Nice people nice music nice food and the staff always happy and friendly.all restaurant are very good but I recommend Pescador(chef Carlos Fernandez) and restaurant Gaucho. I recommend the people to see every night the very nice musicals
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,The water is crystal clear and the sand is like baby powder. Great beach for relaxing or enjoying water sports.
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,Stayed at the Paradisus. Awesome beach - just beautiful. Surf varies from smallish waves to pretty big depending on the weather.
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,Best Beach in Punta Cana. Will come back 1-2 times a year. There is plenty of room to walk miles in either direction and enjoy the scenery
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,Beautiful beach. White Sandy beach. Weather is always perfect. Will highly recommended. Looking forward to come back.
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,From afar it looks gorgeous but if you decide to swim in the ocean your suit will be full of sand by the time you're done and you will have sand flea bites all over you
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,great friendly people great cool white sand beaches. We could walk for miles without burning our feet!
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,This is by far one of the best walking beaches in the Caribbean. Few areas with traffic....however that adds to the enjoyment if you like people watching.
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,love the beach you can walk for miles enough chairs during day kept very clean not a lot of vendors on beach
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,Water was crystal clear. Waves were calm so easy to swim in. Some seaweed washed up on beach day before we left. Beach in front of Magestic Elegance seemed to be the best.
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,Great activity with lots to do!! Speed boating snorkeling  and snuba diving.. What's better then that?!
g147293,d215733,March 10 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 10 2016,The beach is warm and beautiful but be aware of broken glass. Watch where you walk. Probably boaters throw bottles in the water and the glass washes ashore.
g147293,d215733,March 10 2016,We have enjoyed swimming in the sea for hours and walking white sand beach. There are some local stores and bars close next to Barceló Bavaro Beach hotel
g147293,d215733,March 10 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 10 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 10 2016,Had lunch and sat on the beach. Very quiet and relaxing before the fun began and the boat picked us up.
g147293,d215733,March 10 2016,This is the most amazing white sand beach I've ever seen. It goes on for miles and is all the purest white sand you can imagine. The water colours look like post cards and every photo could be it own post card.
g147293,d215733,March 10 2016,Food average device good drinks weak but all you have to do is ask for a shot on the side and you can fix it as you like. Awesome resort and a wonderful time. Will be coming back for sure.
g147293,d215733,March 9 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 9 2016,Bavaro Beach is beautiful and is perfect if you enjoy walking on long white sandy stretches of beach. It does get very busy as it is an extremely popular area to visit and many large resorts are situated here.
g147293,d215733,March 9 2016,Beach is fantastic....water temp around 82 degrees....great for snorkeling or scuba diving. We wore shorties Scuba Diving but it was hardly necessary.
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,Love the beach at Bavaro Princess All Suites. Sand is amazingly soft and waves are awesome. Lots of room so that not everyone is sitting on top of you. The ocean is fabulous.
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 20 2016,Picture perfect beach. Good place for a long walk with the occasional swim on the way. The center/east part of the main beach is where you find restaurants and bars. The west part has mainly all inclusive hotels but also the most beautiful part of the beach.
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,A great long sandy beach to walk and see the different hotels/resorts along the way. The beach is very clean and the resort workers clean the seaweed off everyday. The other great thing is that there is basically no one bothering you to sell you something. Total paradise with a nice Trade Winds to keep you cool in the sun.
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,We enjoyed Bavaro Beach. A little seaweed never hurt anyone. It was gorgeous and so lovely to walk on.
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,The beach goes on for miles and has white/reddish powdery sand. There is always a comforting breeze all day long! The only issue is that when then are strong winds a lot of seaweed gets swept onto the beach(but that is mother nature). Most resorts clean this up daily so it really is no big deal.
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,Awesome week. Fantastic weather 15 minutes of a "sprinkle" on Monday 15 seconds of a "mist" on Wednesday...Perfect!!! All Resort Staff were incredible. We will return no question cannot BRAG enough about this location Thank You for making such a memorable vacation.
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,Great beach! Very clean and not many locals trying to sell you things but when they do they don't bug you 24/7.
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,Right outside our hotel beach was pristine. If we walked west not only did the beach erode but we got very wet too. I liked that there wasn't anyone trying to sell you stuff either unless you went near their store.
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,Great swimming and a nice walk too! The water was warm and the beach was clean. There was a barrier to ensure you are safe not to go out too far with the strong tide.
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,The beach was dirty hard to walk decent distances without having to traverse dangerous obstacles and just seemed run down. We've been there several times and in some places it's great but this one was not.
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,lovely and warm water. No privacy or quiet and hard to stay out of the second hand smokers everywhere.
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,IFA Beach was the cleanest from Seaweed. The next 5 resorts up the coast never cleaned the seaweed from the beach
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,Lots and lots of seaweed day after day and I do not mean a little but loads of the stuff. There is a Lovely Little souvenir market on the beach and some good Bargins but haggle for everything e.g. they wanted $20 for 3 shell that after negotiation I got for $8.
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,You can walk forever along this beach. There is a market along the way where you can browse and purchase local goods
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,We stopped here briefly on a dune buggy tour the view was breathtaking. We bought some cigars from the locals held an iguana took some great photos and saw a few people get married on the beach. The water is so blue.
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,liked; fine sand and not one rock to find.disliked seaweed but the workers clean it up every morning
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,You could go for a long walk along the beach and view all the resorts. A beech with some coral reefs to snorkel at within close proximity to our resort would have made this beach even better.
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,Handicap boardwalk and lounger once we found the boardwalk it was a big help . Staff should point these features out.
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,One of the best beaches I've seen. Clear clean water white sand goes on for miles. Perfect for sun sand swimming snorkelling parasailing watersports.
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,Warm in the 80's. Ocean is a little rough on the Riu resort beach. The island is basically a coral reef. No seashells to hunt. Landscaped with small and large trees for some shade.
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,White sand beautifully clear water. V Busy and a lot of water sports to do. All boats going passed are doing activities and playing loud music so not the kind of beach for a snooze. Jellyfish restaurant is really nice!
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,Excellent beach and pool area with an in the pool bar nice furniture and service. The beach and pool area is very well maintained and enjoyable
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,Been to Mexico so many times and can't find a beach like Bavaro. We always come back to the Bavaro Beach for the white sand turquoise water and miles of beauty....
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,Killer waves  nice sand wide open area reserve beach chairs early around seven in the morning. Many nice girls....
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,Beautiful beach. Lots of loungers. Cleaned often. Faucets to rinse feet off nearby Soft sand. Clear water.
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,Clear blue water very tranquil and peaceful the locals are very helpful and there's a lot of water sports and activities around.
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,This was a nice beautiful beach with crystal clear water and sugar soft white sand. Some areas are a little dirty with cigarette butts and straws.
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,Jose Abreu of Amstar has been taking care of us as if we are family. He will do anything for you with great follow up to make sure your trip is successful
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,Lots of seaweed. Water murky and seaweed not only on the beach strip but lots floating in the water. Not your typical blue clear water.
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,Very scenic quite a bit of seaweed on the shore but that didn't really bother us that much. Many activities such as parasailing glass bottom boat speed boats. Quite a few vendors walk the beach to tryi and sell you on these activities.
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,Been to many Caribbean Islands hands down the most beautiful beach and water can't wait to go back!!
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,Our section of the beach was Be Live & Dreams area. The beach has seaweed floats up to the shore and hotel needs to clean up everyday. A little bit bothered us and we didn't go swim even once. There was minimal people swim in the water. However we enjoyed sun bathing in the white sand beautiful sky and sand.
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,The beach was clean & staff always picking up debris from the ocean seaweed to plastic cups left behind. The water was warm & clear. Totally relaxing!
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,we didn't like the rooms it was dirty and with filthy blankets. Rest food beach and front staff was very friendly. Night show wasn't the great except magic show.
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,food bad service OK .Surley waiters Bar tenders good clean but old beach good check out tough floor show so so
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,Calm water and warm water. Close to snorkel . It's crowned but if you love being in the ocean this is the beach to be. Up north is more quiet but harder to snorkel better to windy water sports or quiet lay out on the beach because of the wave.
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,A cosmopolitan beach great water but be carefull with the lonely stone with sharp points to the east of the beach... i cut my feet there jaja and the souvenir guys are crazy like zombies but nothing serious its a great beach
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,Narrow in spots...some areas cleaner than others. Warm water some rocky areas. But still liked it and was heaven to float around in and swim in.:)
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,The beach is rocky and smelled liked sulfur and was brown with seaweed. Have to go out very far to swim.
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,the breeze is nice but it does push in seaweed and churn up the water and the many boats speeding folks to their various adventures keeps the space to swim very near the beach. No close-in snorkeling which was disappointing but you can book for that offshore. Beautiful white sand and sunny everyday. Nice sunworshipper's beach.
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,Easy access and great people lots of local food with wonderful people there to provide services. Not overwhelming trying to sell you items
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,When there's no algae it's good to swim in. It's not clear I have not seen living things in it I suspect it to be polluted by boats and a river but it's warm it's okay.
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,The beach is awesome except for the seaweed in the morning! All hotel resorts have the cleaners take care of it The sand is nice soft and white
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,I have been to the mayan Costa Rica and Punta Cana and by far this is the nicest beach. Probably why we have been back four times.
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,Clean beach with white sand. Most of the days we were there it was windy. A lot of water sports facilities along the length of the beach. You can walk along the length of the beach for miles together without any obstructions along the way.
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,We loved the beach at Bavaro. Such a gorgeous view of the sunrise in the morning and just a sweet place to lay tan and hang out during the day.
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,good for a value dollar...lots of beach vendors waters may be too choppy for kayaking great for wading & parasailing!
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,A nice white sand beach with tolerable amounts of seaweed. Stroll up and down for kilometers. lots to see and do.
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,Perfect weather every day. When there is no seaweed just gorgeous to walk on the beach. Water is warmer than pools. Great place to go.
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,Clean too. We walked for 20+ minutes in both directions from our resort. Plus the ocean was great to swim in. I've been 3 times over 25 years and still love it!!
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,beautiful beach. but locals were begging for you to buy there trinkets. water was warm and pretty aqua blue.
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,Sunrise you will never forget! Due to weather we had seaweed no ones fault but they couldn't keep up with clean up as they were not prepared.
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,Some tourists are more demanding than others and do not always respect others. Otherwise the beach was very goodplace to spend time there
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,they had like an invasion of the seaweeds but they were cleaning the shore everyday and overall the beaches were clean and pleasurable to walk on.
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,We highly recommend Bavaro Beach area Resorts! Amazing Beach! Clean and Beautiful. Activities and tons of fun!
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,Clean beach and great waves. A lot of seaweed kicks up but the resort keeps it cleaned up. Nice sand and you can walk for miles.
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,Anyone who loves nature and enjoy a nice sunset on a beautiful beach. This is a place for you. Enjoy nice quiet beach front nights at Bavaro
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,There were mounds of seaweed along the shoreline the entire week we were there. We heard this was abnormal but some is common.
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,No fault of the hotel - but there were VAST amounts of seaweed washing up on the beach. They did their best to try and remove it but it was too much to keep up with. The sight and smell was so terrible I spent zero time at the beach.
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,Lots of seaweed. There were guys trying to rake it up every morning. So places were worse than others.
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,We simply enjoyed the gorgeous beach but for other there are many many activities. And there were few to none of the typical beach hustlers you normally see in the Caribbean.
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,Wonderful enjoy the summer in the winter season is a paradise to stay in the cold winter and the people are so friendly.
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,Choppy but fun loved it! Lovely white soft sand cool breeze. Didnt get burnt once. Sometimes a bit too much seaweed but didnt bother us.
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,As much as we like this beach. It's far from relaxing. There's a constant stream of helicopters and other motor control aircraft buzzing the beaches on the entire coastline. Guess that comes with the tourist territories. It's our second vist to this area and as much as we like the beach we may not return because of this issue.
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,The beach is good for walking. I also saw some people running on it. Several shop-owners will come out and try to get you to buy from them. If you go in the late afternoon you can talk them down pretty low on prices for parasailing and other water sport activities.
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,At our resort Majestic Elegance there was an abundance of shade provided at the beach...lots of Palapa huts for shade lots of chairs available. Beach was kept clean of seaweed. Ocean was a bit rough during our stay Dec.22-Jan.5 but water was warm.
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,Waves break too far out. Seaweed...though raked each day. Great sand and palm trees abundant if you want some shade.
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,The sand is white. Beach is properly maintained. Water is warm in some days was dirty form the algae and sand. A lot of Coconut Trees.
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,What a nice place to be white beach blue ocean palm trees. Lots of seaweed too but this happens. Had a great time.
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,The beach is very nice but tons of sea kelp is on the beach each and every day sometimes 2 feet deep. It is also in the water. The tide is generally very mild.
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,Bavaro beach is beautiful clean water is not as clear as Mexico but it was still great. Loved the beach
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,great for water activities or long walks on the beach. No big waves make it easy to cool off without worries. Many bars and restaurants to kick back and relax.
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,I Like to run 8 milles a day and that beach is awesome for that! Its clean soft sand and rely safe to walk or run for milles..
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,Drinks on the beach at sunset...Watersports nearby...walk to local shops...warm water to float around...
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,it's very nice beach quite narrow but sandy and pleasant. But we had a bad luck as during our stay it was completely covered with seaweed.
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,I guess it was the time of year --windy and lots of sea algae...lots of beach activities to do and the sand felt like powder.
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,Picture perfect beach area but the sea grass and swallows were poor for swimming and snorkeling. If you like to sun and walk it would be excellent. The wind kiters were having a great time.
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,loved he beach and the amenities that our resort Grand Bahia Principe provided. Very relaxing and romantic.
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,A wonderful beach along the coconut Coast of Dominican Republic. The waves are a bit strong sometimes due to the position on the Atlantic side of the island but the beach is oure white sand and the water is warm and lovely to bounce around in if not swim.
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,Great beach!!! Water was beautiful and drinks were free flowing! We stayed at the Hard Rock and it was great! The staff was very cordial helpful and the rooms and grounds were beautiful!
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,Took the buggy excursion. Went swimming in a cave drove through the countryside went to a coffee and cocoa plantation and visited the beach. It was a great time! Teenagers really enjoyed it!
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,Beach was wide and long but it was difficult to fully enjoy the ocean due to excessive seaweeds. Hotel staff worke overtime but but the volume of grasses was too much for them to keep up with on 2 days.
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,Fantastic palm tree lined beach golden sand and turquoise waters. Lots of seaweed gets washed in daily which the army of workers and fighting a losing battle to clear up. Some days the sea had so much seaweed floating it was like swimming in minestrone soup!
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,Mexican seas ten times better Will never return Beach dirty water poor Tried to snorkel with son off beach. Current strong seaweed debilitating no fish no shells. Locals won't leave you alone walking on beach - harrassing.
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,Compared to other Caribbean beaches like in Puerto Rico Vieques Virgin Islands etc this was rough strong waves and full of seaweeds.
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,Caribbean Sea beautiful people friendly good value for money and got local places forr hair cut and beauticians
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,Nothing Bad Nothing Great I loved the sand and there were plenty of palm trees if you need to get out of the sun.
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,One of the best beaches I have ever been in. Must go once in your life time! No hassle warm clean clear water...great mohitos!
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,This beach is amazing the water is clear and beautiful. The people speak english and are very kind. They all accept american dollars however be thrifty with what you are willing to spend a normal worker makes $15.00 american dollars a day so dont over spend while you are there!!
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,Beautiful ocean very crowded beach... The sand is white and nice! People can be slobs throwing there trash next to there chairs and not picking it up when they leave!
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 19 2016,Cant say enough about the wonderful beach in PC. The sand and sounds of the ocean just make you relax. As for any seaweed issues its fine. The workers keep it as clean as they can
g147293,d215733,February 18 2016,White sand clear water clean warm sunny. Perfect location for waves bathing or to simply relax. Punts Cana is way better than Puerta Plata
g147293,d215733,February 18 2016,Beautiful beach white sand calm crystal blue water. Resort are the best all inclusive with the beach taking much of the credit.
g147293,d215733,February 18 2016,It would be perfect if it hadnt rocks and glass shards on the sea and seaside! The palm trees are awesome they make shadows for those who dont want sunbath..
g147293,d215733,February 18 2016,We didn't venture far from our resort "The reserve at Paradisus Punta Cana" they had a private beach area on Bavaro beach but we did walk it in both directions and it is exquisite so lovely!
g147293,d215733,February 18 2016,This beach is lovely. The sand is powder white and it isn't overly crowded. Didn't get too many vendors bugging is which was nice. A must visit in Punta Cana
g147293,d215733,February 18 2016,The beach front at the hotel was goodwalk up the way not so nice storm's have wash the sand away ! Make sure what ever hotel you are going to check that out!
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,For the most part the beach was very clean and water clear and blue! Occasionally there was some seaweed in the water and on the beach shore.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Sea is pretty rough so not good for kids also alot of seaweed however this is cleared every Thursday evening so Friday morning the beach is paradise
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Great resort. Can't wait to get back in February 2015. It was quiet and peaceful around the pool. Beach was lovely.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,this beach is all you could as for--so spacious and generally extremely clean. Water is so pretty--rivals Cancun for the prettiest water I've seen. Sand is pristine sugar-sand with no rocks or shells. Ocean bottom is solid footing. Lots of great sights as well. One of the nicest beaches I have ever experienced--loved it!
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Beautiful sand water and atmosphere. As in many beach destinations distance yourself from the local 'pests'.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Great beach. Very safe warm water and there are a lot of water sports and many vendors to buy stuff from. My wife and I have been coming back for years and just love it!!
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,great beaches in the Dominican especially nice at the Bavarro. Lots of seaweed washing up but raked daily by the resort so its still quite nice.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,I walked this beach and area during my visit last year. There is a lot of shopping nearby and good restaurants. The place is pretty civilized and populated and clean. I felt safe there and had a nice time.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,so inclusive educational and fun; good tour guide fun transportation great bunch of co-travellers. Worth the money time and energy. Great interaction with locals.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,just loved hanging out at the beach. A little bit of surf to make it interesting and beautiful sand. Water was nice and warm
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,could not sit close to water so kids could play because of the sea weed??if they raked it ..the ocean would be a nicer place to play
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,plenty of huts to hide from sun if needed and plenty of lounge chairs. The ocean waves were fantastic.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,nice beach but after visiting the Caribbean side of Island  I would not go there any more . Not clear water  huge waves tons of sea grass and million of people..I would go to La Romana next time..
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,liked the soft sand with virtually no stones to mention the clear sea water lovely views and walks along the beach.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,beach was really nice with wonderfull sand and plam trees. Lot of diferent possibilities to enyoj yourself.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,The water is so warm. The storms brought in a lot of seaweed but the hotel staff worked hard to keep it clean
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Miles of beach sheared by may resorts and always kept clean great sand and the weather is fantastic
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Bavaro beach is very beautiful White sand and miles and miles to walk. Shallow at the beginning and gradually deepens
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Beautiful beach clean beach with white powder sand. Some seaweed around areas but the beach staff at the local hotels work really hard to clean it up in a timely fashion. Water was warm. Some days water was a little rough because it is the Atlantic but wasn't unbearable.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,The beach would have been a lot nicer if they could have cleaned up the seaweed. They had nice lounge chairs to sit on and it was low tide when we were there but the seaweed just grossed us out.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Beach was OK but the seaweed made it unpleasant to enter the water. Also the sea was quite rough at times
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,We spent every day of our vacation at the beach. It never rained and we loved the white sand and clear water. Grand Bavaro had grass huts to help protect us from the sun and heat which we enjoyed sitting under along with the drink service.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Beach is beautiful. There are no waves and some seaweed in the water but that does not detract from the beauty. Beach is cleaned each morning.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Love this beach! The images you see online really depict the beauty of it you will be surprised by how accurate they are!
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Lots of seaweed on the beach. Beautiful white sand though. The sea was also quite rough so meant swimming difficult.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Beautiful beach clear and warm waters and well kept and cleaned. We had a seaweed current which brought a lot of seaweed to the beach and in the water but it was removed every day by the hotel staff. Overall very nice beach.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,white sands as far as you can see alittle seaweed on a morning but hotel staff clean it up quickly great for a pre breakfast walk to watch sunrise
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,clean and nice sandy beach. It's safe and no vendors are bothering you. The private beaches of the hotels are utmost safe and you can leave your bags unattended.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Apart from seaweed washed up onto the sands which the local staff employed by the hotels collect daily the sea is remarkably clear. The sands golden and the beach stretched for miles so long walks were wonderful to grab some exercise whilst cooling off the feet.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,We like everything very clean and organized resort Restaurants clean friendly staff we deffen will go back. It is very fantastic fun enjoyable vacation
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Like the beach with fine white sand and warm sea water though the last few days a lot of seaweeds on the beach.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,The waves were too rough causing a ton of seaweed all along the beach. It was there for 3 days before it was cleaned up. The mountains of it made it hard to climb over to get to the water. On of my least favorite beaches I've been to.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,I love that beach it is long and the wave are good. Sometime you see weed but it is not discusting. It is one of the best beach i have gone to. Please note this beach is not good for snorkling since the coral is far away. I will go back:-)
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,It was okay but I have been to better ones it was rough waves for a few days causing alot of see weed on the shores and not being cleaned on a regular basis..
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Highlight of our trip to the Dominican Republic you can walk endlessly locals are around and sell things but do not hassle you too much especially after a simple "No Gracias" and a smile. Beach is breezy but not too rough. A little weedy but it is the ocean after all. One of the nicer beaches we have visited.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Water and beach filled/covered with 2 feet of seagrass. Lots of trash and prostitutes hassling us on the beach too. Very disappointed.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Soft sand and beach chairs as far as the eye can see! You can walk for miles and miles along the ocean.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,The only set back is when it's extremely windy. Then there is a lot of seaweed on the beach. But the beach is long so if you like walking it's perfect for that
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,The sand was lovely and not hot! But the debri on the beach wasn't cleaned up and was ugly to look at ruined the look and feel of the beach. Too many sellers......from hatsbags sunglasses wooden ornaments!
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Hello! I would like to know if you have parasailing tours that include (maybe with extra fees) a video with GoPros(or similar). Please let me know if this is possible and what would the costs be. Thanks!!
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Beautiful beaches dont mind the seaweed it doesnt bite. Water is warm sun is hot. Enjoy and relax in the time youre there.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Garbage beach. Too much seaweed and stones/rocks on ocean floor close to shorline. Should have been cleaned out as they do at other resports
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,There were plenty of chairs. Lots of huts which provided enough shade and sun for the sunseekers. As well as having tables attached to them. Butler service at the beach was also perfect. Not too many solicitors - again the perfect atmosphere for relaxation and fun.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,if you go to punta cana go to bavaro its a very clean beach its a blue flag beach the water had a lot of sea weed don't know if its seasonal but I didn't mind that its all the nature.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,One of the best beaches in the world. Love to the hotel made the best effort to clean the see weed. Great sun sets...
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Too busy and far too much seaweed which made getting in to the sea unpleasant and the sea itself was very cloudy
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Great relaxation on the beach massage if you want one open bar on the beach and staff available to bring you my favorite "Majestic" w/ Rum.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Beautiful beach cleaned everyday of seaweed sea a little choppy but stunning only problem you couldn't buy a drink along the beach when we went for a long walk
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,The sand is a beautiful soft white. The water is not to rough which is nice to be in the water and not being knocked around by rough surf!
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,The water was beautiful and warm. There is a beach front bar that you can walk to or if you'd prefer to stay put there's always guys walking around asking if they can get a drink for you.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Lots of seaweed floating in the ocean and piles of it on the beach...gave the place a dank smell and was gross to step through on the way from the beach to the ocean
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,The wind can make the sea a bit choppy for swimming but you won't find a better public beach with glorious long walks.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Lots of seaweed but nice beach. Beautiful sunsets. We are not real beach people but did one day at this beach.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Excellent adventure deep into mountains easy and challenging lines excellent friendly staff very safe and exciting
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,liked the beautiful sand and gorgeous blue sea loved the beautiful breeze and gorgeous sunny days. The water was refreshing clean still.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Sites and stuff I like water in the pool smells with urine specially in afternoon. Grounds beautiful food was really good in the buffet we did not get sick at all we were using bottled water. Nice and long walk on the beach little crouded
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Spent a week there and really couldn't enjoy the beach - there were tons of seaweed and tractors cleaning it up. Workers using takes and wheelbarrows - don't know if it is always like that but it was really bad - hardly anyone in the water because of it.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,A tropical paradise everyone should visit! It was first tropical vacation years ago and I've gone often since!
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Lovely view not enough chairs. Didn't care for the nude old ladies. Not too much seaweed. Seemed fairly clean from what I could enjoy while I was there.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Easy to swim and enjoy the sun. Bavaro is a great beach for people watching even though it seems a bit gritty with all the fishing boats laying around. Vendors are about as aggressive as you would consider yourself gullible. There is a lot more going on here than at any other beach in the Punta Cana area.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Very beautiful beach! Loved it sand was soft breathtaking view. Love the palm trees great for pictures. Not crowded and no haggling.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,so big and long and pristine but crowded for tanning/relaxing under pallapas....enjoyed though inmensely water clean warm.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,You could find a place by alone in 10 minutes walk on the beach! Clean and big you don´t got "disturbed" by "sellingpeoples" and so on. Rather windy place.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,I've been to lots of beaches all over the Caribbean but Bavaro is just spectacular and you can walk for miles and miles along white sandy beaches bordered by lovely palm trees and breathe in the fresh ocean air.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,clean well maintained beachfront heavy surf breaks well off shore on an apparent reef. Vendors really don't bother you unless you show an interest in their wares. Gentle reminder: just because you can go topless doesn't mean you should. Those that should GO For It!
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Lovely beach and the sellers on the beach were not pushy. You could do Yoga Zumba and learn the Merrange. If you didn't want to join in it was great to watch
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,What can I say. Fully enjoyed my stay at the Bavaro beach. Of course being Upgraded to the deluxe side of the property did not hurt. Simple I like everything. Did I say I liked everything? Currently seeking to try to return before the year is over.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Loved the beach local staff food drinks room cleanliness. Disliked nothing. Natural shade on beach by palm trees. Lovely sitting area at Mamey Bar day or night.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Too crowded and hard to find a lounge chair close to the water. Water was great and the surf fantastic.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,A very clean beach with nice ammenities and great service from nearby restaurants that delievered beverages and appetizers...
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,The water was rough but overall..this is a great beach..great sand and great water..been 2 times now and will go back.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,I have been to Cuba Jamaica Puerto Rico and the DR. This is the best beach in the entire Caribbean - mile and miles and miles of beautiful white sand.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,A great beach to go with wearm water good peoples attractions services If you want you also can have a massage in the beach sand
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,The room was a corner room with a wrap around balcony . There were choices of food from 8 different restaurants If you were not happy you could always order something else. There were not enough lounges but management has responded by ordering 200 more
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Great rooms and views from our oceanfront balcony. Great service and food very clean beach and pool great food very friendly and helpful staff - just a great vaca. Special thanks to Luciano who helped set up our excursion/activities. He was very informative and really catered to what we wanted to do.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,The beach was very long with a lot of palm trees offering some shadowed areas to protect you from the sun.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,This is one of the most beautiful beaches I have ever been to. It goes on forever white sand and turquoise sea. Just enough waves and what a beach should be.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Drinks & food near by . Lovely sand .plenty of sun beds warm sea not to rough no noises to worry Palm trees to keep the sun cool .
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Plenty of sun beds. Quiet spaces. Not far from hotel. Bar service if you wanted it. The sea was a bit lively.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,the beach was amazing bonus it was attached to our resort! super clean and not rocky a bit with the waves but made it fun
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Wonderful Beach with pure white sands and really clean... Sea very warm and clear. Lots of activities around the beach area for excercise buffs... me personally enjoyed watching people excercise.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Beach waves were perfect for just standing or doing some light swimming enjoying the sun. Sand was soft. It was a little dirty with seaweed but the more in you go the less seaweed there is.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Everything you could ask for. Clear water soft and clean sand and not too crowded. Spent hours upon hours here on our trip to the DR
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Beautiful crystal clear warm water. White fine sand beach. Still the Atlantic so some days lots of waves and some days calm.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,We loved walking the beach each morning. The breeze was wonderful and being able to swim in the ocean was great.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,I like the clear water and clean sand... And fight the multitude of fish... Disliked the time went by to fast.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Great beach to tan relax and chill out. Water is clean and clear. Water is also warm. Plenty to see and do along the beach.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,As soon as you get to your beach you feel like you are in paradise with all the palm trees surrounding you.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Gorgeous Waters and soft sand! With all the palm trees and turquoise waters it definitely made for a relaxing lounge on the Beach!
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,The beach was really nice lots of shade. The water was not really clear due to the fact there there was a big storm the week before we arrived and a lot of seaweed has washed ashore. But the grounds crew was out there cleaning up the seaweed. Still a t nice view.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Stunning blue water clean sand and gentle breezes! The beach can be a little narrow in places but we did not have an issue with seaweed or rough currents.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,One of my new top 10 beaches ever. I've been to many Carribean destinations and this beach was definitely one of the best. Just so clean and peaceful I wish I could live there.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Most amazing beaches. Ocean floor was pure sand. No rocks or sea shells. Sand wasn't hot on the soles of your feet. Heaven.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,The water was great and you could swim without much waves. The water was very salty so prepare for the burning eyes.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,We have been on Bavaro Beach in several resorts and have found it to be a wonderful beach. It extends for many miles. The sand is soft. The reef generally cuts down the size of the waves. If you are looking for a beach where you can walk for miles and not run out of sand this is for you.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Close to gift shops but zero amenities available. You can purchase nautical excursions parasailing etc cetera within walking distance. This is immediately next to two very nice resorts which offer high end luxury. You may end up jealous you did not splurge for that option. Good for young couples with a limited budget.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Wonderful site perfect every day we were there. Enjoyed walking the beach and jumping in the continuous waves.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Fine brown colour sand--nice but not as nice as Cuba's sand which is white. Many kilometers (miles) to walk--nice walk with bare feet.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Sand was clean liked the way the beach staf F kept chairs neat and not garbage. but very busy and hard to get chairs after 930 am. Didn't like crowds
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Super clean. The sand under the water felt like I was walking on ceramic tile. The hut/cabanas were spaced perfectly so everyone had a nice view of the gorgeous ocean. The staff members were continually serving us drinks. Iberostar Grand provided towels sunscreen books to read and free beverages. It doesn't get any better.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Like: the energy beach restaurants people watch and fresh fruit shopping from street vendors. Dislike: People are kind of dry and rude; for a place that depends almost entirely of tourism. Not very polite drivers.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,this is by far the most beautiful beach i have been to. and I am an avid island traveling girl !! the sunsets were by far the most beautiful I have ever seen and the sky and water were the most blue Ive ever witnessed and I travel to Aruba yearly and bahamas.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Very clean beach with great sand. Water was pretty choppy when we were there so you couldn't go out too far or do any snorkeling.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,The beach was gorgeous just too much of the seaweeds washing up daily. The resort try to keep it clean but that is out of their control.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Beautiful sandy beaches that go for miles and a bathwater warm ocean! Not too many beach vendors excellent!
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Lots of seaweed and water was a bit murky but likely bc weather was ify for a few days. They cleaned the sand pretty regularly and it was nice and soft
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Views- breath taking! It's a really clean and lovely beach. The water is warm and pretty clear. It's also good to swim or water activities because it's not very choppy. I swam and enjoyed parasailing.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Nice beach with very calm waters hardly wave activity. However there is a tendency to see a lot of kelp!
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,it was very clean and well groomed great lounge chairs and the staff there for why ever you need or want
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,It's long and lovely. Lots of shaded and sunny areas. Great for all. Water was warm and clean. Lots of good fun.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,It's a top notch Caribbean beach. The only problem with it is that it's very crowded but that comes as no surprise due to all the all-inclusives.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,The beach was very clean and relaxing. The water was clear and blue. Very easy access to get a drink.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,The beach in front of The Grand Bahai Principle was the cleanest. The water was wonderful. Be prepared to see lots of exposed breast seems the free congregate in this section you get use to it. Head out early with your towel to get a good spot!
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,All inclusive all smiles free I like the culture of honor and I dislike the time passing by too fast... Too many things to do and too lilt time...
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,breathtaking views beautiful soft white sand great for swimming absolutely perfect!! We parasailed along the beach so we could view Bavaro in its entirty and it was something I will never forget. I will return year after year!
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,This beach is great! The water is clear and warm. Be prepared for very humid weather even in late October.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Outstanding beautiful beach!!! Clean soft and white sand warm turqious ocean what can be better!!!
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Lovely beach; not the best I have been to but good enough for safe swimming and lounging. Chairs and umbrellas were readily available
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Love love love this beach. The waves could be big and strong at times. When the waves were calm the water was fun to be in.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,We loved the beach scattered with palm trees different from other places we have visited. Always clean and lots of activities provided by the Hotel.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,the beach is very very rocky. If you are not into surfing I don't know what you are going to do there. The scenery is pretty though
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Gorgeous white sand beaches  crystal blue waters . Tall Palm Trees line the beach area. Lots of chairs available to sun bath
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,My husband refused to go in the sea prior due to seaweed and unclear water. For once he was happy in the sea as it is beautifully clear. Beaches are super !!! If you like white sands and lazy days this is one for you!¬
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Awesome beach! Warm water clean and lots of tanning area!! No horrendous music or obnoxious spring break like people ruining it. Boats available and Drinks!!
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Beautiful clean beach with the soft sand. Beach goes on for miles. Great walking beach in the mornings and late afternoon.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Clean and walkable for miles. Just ignore the vendors that ply the beach and the shops along the way and you will enjoy it
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Technically BAVARO BEACH is not in the Caribbean but already towards the Atlantic Ocean. It is a nice stretch of sand with palm trees and the different resorts lined up. I enjoy going from the resort pool into the sea - it is just different especially in the evening.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,i have been to a lot of beaches and can safely say it is over hyped ... there is no need to break your Bank to go here ... i love beaches but this one did not impress me ....
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Lot's of children trying to sell you over priced beer. and nothing to do there at all better of staying at the resort.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Temperature of the water was great! The service at the beach was terrific! Drinks were flowing like the ocean.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,More seaweed than I would have thought but all in all very nice beach with beautiful white sand. The resort kept it very clean
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,pure white sand shoreline palm trees gentl sloping shore and a nice walk to either end of the beach. didnt like the beach sellers but they didnt hassle you to much
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,The water was warm and waves were great .sand was very fine and the beach stretched forever.There were always plenty of chairs and umbrellas.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,The beach was well shaded and cleaned regularly. Lots of sun cots to enjoy. Water a bit rough to enter but able to swim in.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,the beach was beautiful and lined with palm trees for miles.the water calm and clear.unlike the beaches on the north shore you were not pestered by people trying to sell you all kinds of goods.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,The water was amazing. Go snorkeling. I would go back again and again! Bring bread and the fish will eat out of your hand!
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Our hotel was on this beach and it was one of the nicer beaches I have been too. Great for swimming lots of palm trees and even a small vendor section at the end should you need anything.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,white sands turquoise water beach cleaned of seaweed everyday.. wished there was nice comfy cushion seats on the loungers and it could be hard to find a lounger
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,The beach was amazing and super close to our room. It was also close to our favorite lunch spot and bartender Edward. We were able to enjoy one another and relax in paradise.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Stunning white sand and bright blue sea. This beach is definitely worth a visit you will not want to leave.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Tours the clean beach.beach chairs and service..Fishing guided trips shopping a great experience..Somewhat to Americanized all want American money and alot of it like living in Manhattan NYNY..
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Very clean and very safe beach during the daytime. Not much bother with vendors. Very relaxing. We enjoyed walking one end to the other.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,nice but a bit choppy and boy very salty sea water hot hot hot and hot ...............................
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,great soft sand and you can walk out in the water a good long way but avoid the hawkers if at all possible.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,This beach is wide and is loaded with beautiful palm trees. Can have a bit more seaweed than most in some areas.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,I've visited this beach 3 times at 3 different resorts and have never been dissappointed. The water can be rough but the variations of colors are gorgeous. And once past the breakers the floating and relaxation is great. I suppose most of the resorts clean the beaches every morning because they are clean as far as you can walk!
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Beautiful beach we had fun in the sun! Best light and tanning time is in the morning thanks to the beach location. Sorry no ocean sunsets. At Bahia Principe they kept the beach very clean we ran around barefoot all week.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Amazing sand and water. Love to live here. Try to walk on sand and check out all resorts. Don't forget your camera because you might get best picture of your life here.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Loved the waves and clear blue water. The water sports were so much fun. We enjoyed the para sailing banana boat and couch. There were plenty of beach chairs for use.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Beautiful beach. Resort staff extremely friendly and accommodating. Restaurants great. Some staff spoke little or no English however.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Really laid back and nice for people-watching. Not the beach you want to go to if you want a quiet private beach but lounge chairs and some light music made a visit here really fun! Try the Pina Coladas at Jellyfish- they were perfect!
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Employees rude and spoke little English if any. Food not good pools close at 8PM eating is outside under pavilion.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,when it go to hot all the sea weed cam to the beach but lucky enough Iberostar had employees cleaning their beach....
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Gorgeous area on a more 'quiet' beach (during the off-season at least). Local restaurants had delicious food.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Lovely long white beach one of the best I have been too could walk out nothing underfoot great waves for body boarding nice walk across as well few hotels share this lovely beach
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,It was very pretty and a great experience but once you got on the beach there were a lot of locals trying to sell stuff. Just would rather not have been bothered.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,There are lots of locals trying to sell their products if you are polite they are quite respectful. great sand and the beach runs on forever.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,This is a great beach. You can walk for miles. The sand does not get too hot. We had wavy conditions every day.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,We stayed and the Catalonia Bavaro Resort and we loved it and it was out 2nd one we have stayed in Punta Cana and the 4th over all for the All-Inclusive resorts that we have stayed in and is the best one. The resort is huge and well kept and we hope to be back as soon as we can.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,every thing was perfect special the hostess at la brisa carmen lamonte she was perfectand at the golf club raymond did the most that i was able to do for us.every thing was number 1
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Terrific beach - long and wide with super fluffy white sand! Perfect sand castle building for the kids :)
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Yes..it's true. Bavaro beach was voted the best by Conte Nast traveler. It's wide long and has powder sand with a packed bottom no rocks and seaweed is cleaned each day.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,I was inlove with the place the people was so nice and helpful I will love to go back again with my family again.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Too many people trying to get to the beach we've been here before several times and never struggled to get space until we came here...
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Beautiful beach clear blue sea and white sand. What more could you ask for. Beware there are people selling things on the beach but our hotel security guard got rid of them.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,This was a clean beach well kept gorgeous pink speckled soft sand didnt seem like there was any water life to worry about (jellies etc....) as I didnt see a single anything not even a shell!! But the swimming was fabulous the view was amazing.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Like all the photos one sees of tropical beaches. White sand blue sea and palm trees what else do you need?
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,visited in Oct 2014 via the Paradisus Royal Service Adults Only beach access. The water was rough and had lots of seaweed but still nice
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,It was rough and lots of seaweed but they managed every day to do he best they could to clean it up!
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Fine white sand beach that seems to go on and on. Ocean bottom drops very quickly when in the water. Seaweed is dependent on the ocean currents but the resorts get it cleaned up very quickly. Beautiful sunrises.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,the water was beautiful blues. There was seaweed but it is the ocean...what do you expect. And the workers were working continuously to try to stay ahead of it .
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,we walked from our hotel Paradisus to Bavaro Beach was very nice clean calm nice palms nice people nice everyting  we wil be back
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Pretty beach with calm water. There are many resorts on this stretch of PC shoreline so you can walk and see a lot.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Beautiful white sand and blue water. Rough waves. Plenty of places to sit either in the sun or shade. Bar on the beach. Activities on the beach.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Enjoyed this excursion but did think that I was going to be able to drive the boats around on our own and not following the guide in a big circle. Snorkeling was nice but I wasn't able to do the Snuba very well. Had a couple of panic attacks but my daughter loved it!
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Beautiful beach arrived here on a horseback riding trip which i would thoroughly recommend. Generally can be organised with your hotel.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Beautiful but wish there could have been a lot less seaweed when we visited and wish the sea was calmer too.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,The seaweed was a little much at times  but wouldn't deter me from coming back everything else you get here far outweighs the seaweed
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,lots of seaweed on the beach :-( they clean it up daily but more just washes up. It's a shame it could be a great beach
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,very clean! and beautiful!! the only downfall was too many peddlers and not enough bartenders/ waitresses.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Seaweed was horrible. The water is a very pretty green color if you can get past all the seaweed. Do yourself a favor and choose a different location.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Water was beautiful.Plenty of chairs to lay out. Activities to join by the staff for entertainment. The beach was 100 feet from our patio.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Great Beach white sands calm waters can't wait to go back to visit. This is a must see beach on you vacation.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Good Value. Three activities: Speedboat Snorkling SNUBA! GREAT Customer Service. Experience of a lifetime
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,nice & friendly people. we did a catmaran booze-cruise with BeBe. We really recommend for groups of people.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,Very Clean it never seems a full beach it just shows you how big it is.Plenty of watersports volleyball etc to do.
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 17 2016,This beach is great  quiet windy so keeps you cool the food here is delicious and would highly recommend it.  few palm trees for shade  free shuttle to and from hotel
g147293,d215733,February 16 2016,Beautiful beach plenty of reports at different price points here. Some more crowded than others. Enjoy nice long walks along the beach and warm water to swim in!
g147293,d215733,February 16 2016,Great sand great surf and great beach! Excellent place to holiday relax and holiday. We first went here 30 years ago and the place is very busy but the beach is great.
g147293,d215733,February 16 2016,Most upscale hotels have their own section of beachfront but everyone is entitled to walk along the shore. Great sunrise and sunset opportunities
g147293,d215733,February 16 2016,The access was very good and the beach was smooth an sandy. The water was shallow with a nice level of surf. Watersports were available. I particularly enjoyed the included sailboat use.
g147293,d215733,February 16 2016,Have been here twice plenty of all inclusive deals for all desires. Don't brush your teeth with the water....too many minerals will make you sick....Bring sun tan lotion
g147293,d215733,February 16 2016,This beach is nice enough but it's a public beach and not part of the hotel I stayed in. Sadly as you walk along the beach you will find bags of rubbish dumped and half buried into the sand here and there. Lots of other litter scattered about too which really detract from what otherwise is a gorgeous beach.
g147293,d215733,February 16 2016,Beautiful white sand beaches! There is lots of beach to walk my husband and I loved to walk the beach every morning and watch the sun rise.
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,The beach here is excellent and goes on for miles but many of the resorts in the area seemed to have too much shade. Be choosy if you want sunshine!
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,Great beaches ... You can walk for miles!!!! Beautiful!!! Nice waves to swim in. Not crowded but you can always walk for miles just to soak your feet in the water. Beautiful white sand! Great place to be!
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,I loved the people watching rolling waves soft sand and comfy beach chairs. Such a gorgeous beach. The sand fleas are ugh...have cervesa....the bugs won't matter lol
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,Pretty clean beach. Just did not care for the vendors when you are walking on the beach outside of the resort property lines. Only access it seems is through the resorts and you have to be a guest at one of them to access the beach
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,The beach was beautiful & clean nothing hard or sharp to step on. Deep soft powdery white sand for miles.
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,This beach was absolutely beautiful and clean. There were so any areas to sit in peace and serenity and it was very family friendly. All of the staff were friendly and the water felt great.
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,fantasic beach just like a picture postcard white and pink sandy beach. There are plenty of activites to keep you occupied like peddloes and canoes. B ut you most do some snorklling fantastic clear water to see the fish which are right where you swim near the shore/
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,Disliked distance to the beach and having to wait for transportation to it. There is no washroom on the beach. There were a lot of palapas and chairs. We didn't notice any beach activities.
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,Clean beach and crystal clear waters. Looking over the horizon the colors of water turn from aqua green to aqua blue to dark blue.
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,Beautiful scenery great beach... The place that I went was more family oriented but that actually doesn't mater. A lot of palm and activities in order to have a great time...
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,I loved everything! Olympus Tour was great. I love Erik Francois my tour guide rep! The hotel was clean.
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,We had a rental and could not find parking fo rthe life of us! The beach itself was....meh. I've seen MUCH better in Florida and the patrolling hotel security form each of the nearby properties was a little-off putting as they monitored to ensure non-guests weren't on THEIR section of the beach.
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,its clean  relatively quiet and perfect for snorkelling and looks amazing. our hotel was right on the beach and there was never a shortage of sun loungers
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,Too much seaweed in the water glass on the beach was kept very well could have done more to keep it cleaner.
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,Great place to take a walk. Very nice sandy beach. Clear and clean water. Amazing place to spend your vacation.
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,This was in my top two most beautiful beaches I've been to...no rocks no seawood...just soft white sand and the prettiest turquoise color ever!
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,loved beach and resort. did not like the live entertainment except for the casino which had many slots and games
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,Stunning. Pure sand no rocks shells or other creatures to step on. Could walk for miles. Love that blue color
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,One of the most beautiful beaches you will ever see. Excellent for swimming sailing and you can walk forever!
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,Beautiful beach lots of water activities available. We did the Bavaro Splash which was snuba diving snorkeling and speed boats. Amazing time and would do it again!
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,Its a good beach where you can find some local restaurants uniquely prepared for tourists but still is nice.
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,This is the beach all resorts r on. A little wavy at times but clear tons of activities on the beavh
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,Beautiful white sand beach clear blue water but watch out for the local vendors who get too aggressive
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,Bavaro beach goes on for miles so it's great for walkers and runners. Yes there is seaweed depending on the season but it does not detract from the beauty of Bavaro.
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,Excellent service food and beautiful hotel! All employees went beyond call of duty to please me! Lot of activities and perfect place to enjoy your vacation!
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,Bavaro Beach in Punta Cana is one of if not the best beach in the Dominican Republic. With white sands and warn turquoise waters there is nothing not to like about this beach. Hotels follow the length of the beach but it is never overcrowded and is constantly cleaned and kept seaweed free throughout the day.
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,Beautiful clean sand but a little too much sea weed warm clear water once you had cleared the sea weed away
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,Good family beach to go too. Love the beach and the clear water. Just didn't like all the seaweed that clings on to you. But still good.
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,I love the Bavaro beach. I have gone in many places in the Carabbian but to me this is the best of all. White fine sand beautiful palms and a spectacular sea..what else should I ask for?
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,There is a beautiful view of the beach from the Royalton area make sure that you stay for a sunset. Very serene.
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,Top 10 beaches in the world and I agree!!! Clean and well maintained not too busy. Great views of the ocean and tip of Bavaro
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,Beautiful finewhite sand. Wide beachbeautiful coastline. Great little shops along the beach with good prices for souveniors.
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,The location the staff the landscape... sll exceed my expectations. The food choice is excellent very tasty and well prepared.Cleanliness is flawless the beach is beautiful also the pool area is great. My only concern was the gym and I was right is not well equipped for this higly rated resort.
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,I have visited this beach 15 times over the past 20 years this is paradise were the sand is white and soft the warm clear waters make this one of the best beaches I have ever visited. Thisnk of the old "bounty" adverts and this is where you are.
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,Beautiful white sandy beaches and palm trees all along the coast make it one of the best beaches in the world
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,Nice beach but some seaweed from tropical storm that came thru last week made it a tad unpleasant but overall a great beach experience.
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,Great waves to simply jump about in lovely water great sand. Spent hours in the sea. Loved getting taken out by the waves when you least expected it
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,the first couple days there was alot of seaweed but it didn't last too long. They had people cleaning the whole time
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,Beach was great except for the many "beach vendors". Don't take cash; then you just say "no dinero"... still if you're walking they'll often keep walking with you and talking up their attraction. Also many Europeans visit here so be prepared for some toplessness and very skimpy beach wear.
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,Nice sand lots of chairs waiters for drinks. Water is warm though some seaweed. Outside of the resort beach however one is bombarded with hawkers selling tee shirts massage paragliding scuba hair braiding etc.
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,The water was perfect...there was a lot of seaweed ion the early morning but it gets cleaned up pretty fast by the hotel staff.
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,The beach was beautiful. Lots of chairs and umbrellas. The only bad thing was the seaweed/sea grass. The temperature was nice.
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,like it everytime... but... there is too much seaweed in september... during hurrican season... The beach and water is not so nice... but... i have seen it much better. But the locals try very hard to clean it!
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,Not crowded plenty of room lovely palm trees. There was a lot of sea grass employees everyday at keeping in cleaned up.
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,pretty views but lots of seaweed in ocean & beach but beaches cleaned frequently. a little disappointing however. many vendors pestering you to buy things or trips. not very quiet.
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,Algae on the water. Public and private mix and vendors on the beach... they sell you everything...time restriction for safety on the beach.
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,Not as calm and warm as Caribbean Sea waters but nonetheless beautiful and clear. There is lots of shade with palm trees close to the beach shore.
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,Are whole family loved the beach and getting the platinum package kept the locals selling things away from you.
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,Loads of seaweed however it was cleaned every day so very nice indeed! I would recommend it to couples especially!
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,Bávaro is the perfect place to be. You can't believe the color of the ocean the incredible coral sand the water sports you can do here or just lay in the sun. Beautiful you just want to come back.
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,Warm water and clean soft sand. What else could you ask for when visiting paradise. Seaweed was cleaned off the beach every other day so the buildup didn't get to be too heavy
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,Excelent sea always had available chairs the restaurant with drinks and food nearby was also great to stock up on food and getting hidrated home of Scuba Caribe the place i got certified on Scuba diving
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,This is one of the best beaches i have been to in my life!!!! Clean water perfect weather. I did not like that i had to leave so soon :-(
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,water temperature color sand really all excellent the only thing that the time had a lot of seaweed but not so well other
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,Beautiful white-sand beach that is well maintained. Great for morning walks or evening strolls. In the evening the wind comes off the water feels like a day in paradise. One of the better beaches I've visited.
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,Great beach area. The water is beautiful and the beach has the softest sand I have ever walked on! Perfect water temperature in the Fall. Great place to visit!
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,clean breezy and beautiful. Lots of space shade available sea warm and gently shelving. Lovely. A must visit
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,More folks to deal with but the are is a must see with wonderful lush gardens and blue ocean. Went for a one day outing to snorkel and ride in a speed boat. The experience was wonderful really enjoyed myself.
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,Beach is clean and beautiful and the water is clear and blue It is very peaceful but a lot of people will bother you trying to sell you excursions which is annoying.
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,Beautiful clean beach just picture postcard. Not very busy lots of sun beds and umbrellas. People came around asking you to buy trips from them but a polite "no thanks" and they went away after telling you to have a great day.
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,Very nice vacationthe hotel was very nice  17 restourant only visit 5 rest was close slow season  customer service Daniel Mendez was excellent guy help us with everything we needed thanks Daniel

g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,The beach was great for taking a long walk and people watching. Nice rolling waves and you can snorkel from the beach.
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,The water was great...not cold not warm just right. The sand is very soft...great beach!!! There are lots of kiosks or small stores next to the Iberostar Grand Bavaro Hotel where you can bargain for the best possible deals...
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,nothing the water was warm clear beach not too crowded never had to search for chairs beautiful beds on the beach ******* sums it up
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,Fantastic waves if you can't swim do not go far from the shore strong under tow not good for snorkeling.
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,I liked the beach and activities on it. I disliked all of the seaweed that had washed up on it. The warm water was very pleasant as was the chaise lounges that was available for everyone.
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,white sand blue sea.....awesome. plenty of sunbeds bars and not to crowded. There are some lucky lucky men but they don't bother you.
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,Just the opportunity to kick back relax swim in some of the cleanest and clearest ocean water I've seen. Some local shops close by some water activities that were easily accessible and a great ocean breeze that rounded out the whole deal.
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,staff worked hard to clear the seaweed every day. Sailing and kayaks were free and the bars were close to the waters edge
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,always seaweed on the beach overcrowded no ski jets but you can get some weed. lots of vendors pushing for trade long beach but we have cleaner and more beautiful beaches up in Scotland.
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,The Ocean is so soothing and inviting swimming is easy and plenty of water sports available taking a taxi boat along the Bavaro coast line is not to be missed
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,Loved the weather beaches nightly shows and food availability. Very few staff/workers spoke English but communication was not too bad.
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,Clear Water and a good spot to relax and get a tan. Had an amazing summer vacation. Looking forward to go back in the future.
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,guess we picked a bad week. Tons of seaweed! First day wasn't bad but after that almost too much to go in. YUCK
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,Loved the crystal clear water. Needs more shade umbrellas from individual hotels. 1st day lots of seaweed in the water 2nd time barley any seaweed. I guess it just depends on the day.
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,Secure clean beautiful never ending beach. Walked for hours markets not too far! Only downside was the strong waves maybe due to the time of year we travelled. Lots of long chairs and palapas available throughout the day. Boogie boards are hilarious to use especially in strong waves!!!
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,you can loose your glasses reallllll easy in the strong water! haha but make sure you take cheap pairs... also there are some off site massage ppl on the beach... check if they are safe and bargain to like 20 - 30$ and get yourself a massage!
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,I loved the All-Adult atmosphere; but I noticed that there are caretakers for the kids If you have some. There are areas built for Kids Enjoyment as well as for the parents. Throughout the Complex of Resorts; EVERYONE is covered for fun & accommodations!
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,Do not expect anything fancy Very little chairs compare to the traveler Cold drinks and beer comes worm
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,the water was beautiful.many beach activities.perfect for relaxation. the wait staff was excellent& on time.
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,This beach is very well kept and is safe for families. Not a lot of locals bothering you with trying to sell you stuff.
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,the beach stinks like sewage from all the seaweed growing there. You have to walk thru it to get to a small sandy bottomed area but the water stinks.
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,Very beautiful fun nice to snorkel in. Can get very crowded. The ride to beach from resort was a little costly by cab.
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,In the am there was seaweed later in the day it was really pretty the hotel staff worked really hard to keep it good.
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,Loved the entire trip and took city bus around without any problems even though our bad and we don't speak their language.
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,Great beach but could be cleaned more often plenty of chairs and palapus for shade. great breach bar service
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,We liked everything and disliked nothing! We enjoyed a nice cold drink on the beach chairs under the palm trees admiring nature's beauty!
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,Very close to hotel beach bar available sea warm plenty of beach beds to lie on. Reef not far with a reasonably priced 4 day experience ie snorkelling massage you can be as adventurous as you want
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,Soft white sand lovely surf. One of the nicest beaches I have been on with lots of shade from numerous palm trees.
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,I love the beach snorkelling and sunbathing under the palm trees. My husband loves sailing on the beautiful Caribbean sea.
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,it was quiet we were belly surfering we were on a tour so we didn't spend a lot of time there would of had more time there
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,Beautiful beach with baby powder like beach sand the clear blue water is amazing! Nicest beach Ive ever been too!
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,Bavaro Beach is a long stretch of golden sand in the Punta Cana peninsula. The water is warm waves are usually moderate or small you can walk forever. Beautiful beach
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,Absolutely beautiful beach. You can walk forever and enjoy the scenery. Loved the turquoise ocean and sand between my toes. I will be back :)
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,We have always found the beach at Bavaro to be excellent- warm water white sand gentle and not-so-gentle waves. With the turquoise colour of the water and palm trees along the shore what's not to like?
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,Must see to believe it was absoultely beautiful! Enjoyed it very much! The water was so clean and inviting!
g147293,d215733,February 15 2016,Loved the beach walk every morning beautiful soft sand to walk on. If you don't want it too be too busy go early it is very crowded later on in the morning.
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,I was there during 2015 thanksgiving weekend and sea was rough and beach was full of seaweed. I have been to many Caribbean islands but this was one of the worse. Unfortunately you got to blame the nature.
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,White sand beach amazing colors fantastic sea. Indeed this is one of the best sea of the world the beach is animated but still quite enough to have relax.
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,Awesome staff great beaches nothing more you can ask for during vacation! The good is great daily shows are also great. I would definitely come back very soon.
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,Great snorkelling lots of beach chairs available no annoying vendors lovely pink/white sand roped off area for swimming vs. boating geocaches nearby
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,The worse stay in my life . They put us in prison for expedia making a mistake on 4 people instead of 2 . The food was horrible . They treat Americans very bad .we have no power in there country .dont go to this hotel
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,lots of seaweed at times beach peddlers and the snorkel boats park right off the coast so there's never a nice horizon - LOTS of boats are congregated there all day long.
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,Amazing beaches & beach walk. So many resorts & wonderful scenery. Sand quality changes as you walk down the beach.
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,Beautiful Beach white sands blue waters warm and welcoming. A bit of sea weed on shore but once inside the water it's amazing!
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,Enjoyed the calm sea felt safe with the kids in the ocean. Good beach side service. No peddlers on the beach.
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,I love Everything!!! the personal was great and the food was excellent!!!As a first time traveling to this resort in the Caribbean area I'm comfortable in reporting that the Melia Caribe Tropical was the top resort. We stayed in the Adults only Level section and simply had an excellent time.
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,In August due to the rainy period the water can be a bit churned up with sea-grass. The shore is cleaned daily and life-guards are in place.
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,Beautiful beach white sand. Lots of seaweed though. Kids loved it with the low tide and shallow waters. It was nice an windy so they could fly their kites.
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,This beach is absolutely beautiful clean and got something for everyone. With quiet spots entertainment if you want it beach bars and two beach cafe that are restaurant quality.
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,There is no doubt that Bavaro is one of the top ten beaches in the world. Powder white sand and crystal clear water make it difficult to leave the beach in the evening. You can walk forever along the beach and won't be hassled by sellers and other "service providers".
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,The beach was super clean and so quiet. It has an amazing sunrise. No local sellers trying to sell you stuff. The sand was so cool compared to the hot ground.
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,All beaches around Punta Cana are amazing but this one is worth seeing and visiting :) Take towel your favorite music and you will have time of your life !
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,Pictures do not translate reality. Very windy and kelp everywhere. We spoke to other guests and and employees about it and they confirmed that was year around.
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,beach is beautiful sand - water the colour and temperature that you Want! Went parasailing Awesome - again be aware you are on a tropical island - rocky boat but lovely
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,So much seaweed you could not enjoy the water at all. Bar is also far from beach. Definitely the worst part of the resort.
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,Absolutely gorgeous beach. They pick up seawood morning and afternoon so to keep the beach looking pristine. It's gorgeous and clear!
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,The beach was amazing so soft but no shells to be found on the beach at all... unless you were planning on buying them from a vendor.
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,The beach was beautiful. We went to the Grand Palladium Bavaro for lunch and had a nice lunch. The service was better and the people nicer
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,Sand is the best feature. Too much seaweed. No shells to speak of. A middling Caribbean beach at best.
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,Bavaro beach was beautiful and very clean plus it helped that our resort was right there. The water was so clear and there were good location for photo ops
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,Although not many people seem to frequent the public beach it was beautiful. Palm trees crystal clear waters. Minus the seaweed which built up from time to time and was quickly removed - this was a great beach!
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,This was a very fun thing to do if you like the open water. Snuba Snorkel and the speed boat were fun.
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,shared with another hotel but we had to go on separate sides very bizarre but the sea was clean and warm and we did boogie boarding when the waves got a little rougher
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,Beautiful white sands blue water but Too much seaweed in the water and rough waves of the Atlantic Ocean.
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,Beautiful beach crystal claer water and white sand what more could you ask for. Water was great very calm and clean.
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,Not real sure why there was so much seaweed but the beach and water were full of it. We barely got in the water due to all of the seaweed. We have been to Punta Cana before and don't remember there being any seaweed before.
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,Great white sand but lots of sea weeds but not too bad over all very good I certainly would go back to same area.
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,More seaweed this time (August 2014) than I remember (2009) - Still very nice though. 50 characters!? - It's a beach what more can I say?
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,I don't think the hotel is worth 4.5 star rating 3 to 3.5 at the very best. The air conditioner didn't work for almost 2 days and we were told they would be fixed by end of the day. It was our first trip to Punta Cana not sure if we love it.
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,had fun and the water was so clear and we had so much. I would recommend to go there to anyone who wants to enjoy the tropical area.
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,All beaches in Punta Cana have white sand clear waters palm trees wonderful temperatures just pay attention to the mosquitoes after 5 pm they start to rise.
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,It is an awesome beach. Not too crowded. The only downside is there was quite a bit of seaweed floating around. The water visibility wasn't as clear as I was expecting.
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,The beaches here are beautiful but not very well kept. I wish the locals appreciated what they have and kept it clean.
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,If you ever wanted a few hundred yards of virgin beach to yourself Walk a few minutes and it's all yours.
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,Stayed in the water for hours. The water temperature was nice. The beach is clean. We enjoyed the water in the afternoon with nice big waves.
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,The beach is beautiful lovely warm clear sea and white sands the beach can get quite busy but that didn't bother us as the views were breathtaking. Also take a stroll down there during the evening all you can hear is the ocean very relaxing :)
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,bavaro beach in great we did snorkling speed boats and snuba here. it was an awesome experience. would absolutely do it all over again
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,Really brilliant. Not too crowded where we were (riu palace bavaro) and lovely friendly people. I also had some great runs along the beach where you can run barefoot without constantly running into rocks!
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,I can't think what's not to like it's where the Occidental Grand Hotel is which was the Hotel we were staying at!
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,Clean Caribbean beach Lots of vendors offering you knick knacks or excursions. Unfortunately TS Bertha came by and we were not able to be in the water comfortably for most of our stay
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,gorgeous take a bread roll as if you go into sea upto top of your legs there are little fish to feed
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,Beautiful location and something you have to experience! You really do get that paradise island feeling here
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,If you get bored sitting swimming then you can walk for miles along this beach. We had shops that went into the sea and at high tide it was a great adventure to walk pass these shops should really wait for low tide.
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,I loved everything about this resort except we had to wait 2 days to get the room we requested but in the end it was worth it.
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,Nice sand clear water but tons of seaweed almost un-swimmable at times due to this. Maybe it was the time of year?
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,Good - fine white sand breeze choice of water sports local shops on beach (after our hotels section) traders not allowed in and around the hotels sunbeds. A flag system is used to say whether it is safe to swim or not. Can't think of anything I didn't like.
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,The area and surrounding is absolutely beautiful. The beach is situated near nice outdoor cafe's and resturants. If you stay in a local condo then you can walk to everything.
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,Beautiful beach with soft white sand shade from palm trees canopies. Vendors do approach to sell bits and pieces but are not put out when you politely say no. Sea is warm and great for kayaking etc waters-ports available.
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,It's wonderful to see whole family out together enjoying nature and each other. Weddings are also something you'll see if walking the beach just beautiful.
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,Great Sand a beach for the sea-weed enthusiasts. great for kayak and Catamaran. Very nice sand and Sunrise.
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,Warm clear water white sandy beach. Stunning beach palm trees and shady palm tree canopies. Water activities available kayaking paragliding and speed boats available. A perfect beach.
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,The most beautiful beach I have ever been to perfect for the kids! The sand is powdery and white the water is clear blue and the perfect temperature. You can walk for miles and ever get tired of watching those waves.
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,Great experience for myself and my 12 year old Son - great organization & reps. Highly recommended. Snorkelling was good speed boating was a first for me lol - the snuba was a different experience and all very well organized.
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,Our resort had loads of beach chairs umbrella tables and plenty of palm trees if you wanted shade. White sand and blue water - what's not to love?
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,clear water warm water not too many waves water not to deep close great chairs drinks are free
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,long crescent beach with white sand that is well-protected from wave action by reef system. clear water great walking and swimming in fairly shallow low current water.
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,The beach and water were actually nice. I loved the sand-however the sand was filled with thousands of cigarette butts.
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,Loved the warm turquoise waters hated the seaweed. great white sand beaches. Variety of people on the beach - be prepared for European style (aka topless) sunbathers and walkers
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,Great beach with very calm sea and very clean sand. The water is very warm and shallow great to chill out. Don't expect to see lots os colorful fishes.
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,Water was gorgeous. Aside from that there are many water activites to do. I tried out The Mable and reccomend it to everyone. It is exhilerating and breath taking omg i loveddd it!
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,The beach is beautiful and clean. They do have seaweed but are constantly raking it up. As you get close to the shops you will get approached by vendors but they are not threatening.
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,Very clean beach with lots of activities shops and cafés on the beach. Everything you'd expect from a good beach!
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,Stay on your beach! If you go up the beach or down the beach it is not as clean and not as desirable you will be fighting off the vendors pushing There sun glasses or anything else they can sell you.
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,Beautiful soft white sand and cool turquoise water. The beach is dotted with tons and tons of palapas to sit under for refuge from the sun. Clean and absolutely stunning this is one of the most beautiful beaches I've ever seen.
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,Little shallow but nothing to be concerned about. Clear water and a lot of space of sand. Sales persons respect your space and won't botter you.
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,Beautiful white sandy beach and clear blue water. Long walks on the beach fun to play in the water. No snorkeling here.
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,Powder soft white sand. No rocks no shells. A storm had just passed so there was an excess of seaweed but it dissipated as the week went on.
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,Pretty beach Water was cool/warm be watchful of naked European tourists aren't any bars close to any of the beaches
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,loved the soft sandy beaches and beautiful tropical waters. Hated the vendors all over the beach the whistling and constant badgering is awful and enough was enough. Security turns a blind eye.
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,The food was luke warm food. Seemed like it had been sitting for a while. Wanted to try different foods it looked like warmed up left overs from the main buffet the night before
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,This beach has beautiful sand just perfect. The waves are huge and great for surfing or boogie boarding.
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,My local friend took me to Bavaro Beach for happy hour. It was fun and beautiful. We had a couple of drinks walked along the beach shopped for some souvenirs and took a lot of photos!
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,Our hotel was on this beach. It is clean and calm. Just gentle waves. No rocks or shells. White sand beaches. Just a bit of sea weed. First day saw lots of fish swimming with us.
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,Loved just bobbing in the warm waves and the beautiful sand and palm trees I just wish the smokers were more considerate about throwing their butts around. The sand was constantly cleaned and raked so it would have been perfect if the slobs didn't leave their empty packs and butts around.
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,all good . very nice people  the hotel super the sevice very good restuant good  food very good.....

g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,I was ok with the beach we like to snorkel and there is no snorkeling in bavaro. there is a nicer beach near by called macao the water is clearer but no hotels there. The beach at bavaro is too crowded.
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,Its an amazing destination. Place is well worth the trip. Nothing bad I can say about it just wish i could go more often.
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,Our resort sat on the South end of Bavaro beach. The beach is beautiful…. and everyone knows about it. It gets pretty crowded but definitely worth a visit to relax in the turquoise water.
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,Long wide beach with soft white sand and clear blue water! About an hour ride from airport. The offer most beac activities including parasailing  banana boat  kayak but al jet skis are prohibited!!! We were disappointed about the no jet ski rule.

g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,We spent a lot of time on the beach and thoroughly enjoyed it. The sand is wonderful! There was some seaweed but the resort raked it in the morning and it was fine. We loved all the palm trees on the beach. It was easy to seek out shade when we'd had too much sun.
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,

g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,We are planning another trip back. The Melia Level Adults only was worth every penny! It was a wonderderul relaxing romantic time!
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,TV could use a lot more English speaking channels. Food was great except for the beef - it just does not taste like American beef. People were very nice and the rooms were beautiful and very clean.
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,

g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,Gorgeous water soft sand clean beach. It can be rocky in some places along the shoreline so be careful when getting in the water. There are also some shops along the sand where you can haggle for gifts and souvenirs.

g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,The white sand never got hot!! Water was amazing and the coral reef eliminated waves which made water sports super fun.
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,Definitely worth going to Punta Cana. It's really a special place. Loved my honeymoon there. Great people and great location.
g147293,d215733,February 14 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 13 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 13 2016,We love Bavaro Beach it is our favorite of any beach in the world we been to. You walk forever on this beautiful beach & never get tired of it.
g147293,d215733,February 13 2016,Best beach service I have ever experienced. The breeze and a good book is all you need!! Of course please try the drink of the day!!
g147293,d215733,February 13 2016,The beach was great for walks or just relaxing all day water was clean and at pleasant temperature. People are very friendly and they do anything to accommodate your needs.
g147293,d215733,February 13 2016,A gem of fine soft white-powdered sand. Miles of it to exercise walk and enjoy on. Safe and the fresh clean air exhilarating. Don't let the natural sea-weeds bother you. Enjoy !!!
g147293,d215733,February 13 2016,Excellent!! Beautiful! You can get a dune buggie or ride horses or surf. It is gorgeous! We also went to a cenote cave nearby.AMAZING! A must see!
g147293,d215733,February 13 2016,The bavaro beach in punta cana is the most beautiful beach I've seen. We have been to several Islands St Marteen Antiqua this is by far the best.
g147293,d215733,February 13 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 13 2016,This is definitely one of the nicest beaches we've had the pleasure of visiting. It's pretty busy along the strip we were at but it's still great. The market 2 km from the Luxury Bahia Principe Esmeralda is so much fun to visit also.
g147293,d215733,February 13 2016,Nice white sand beach. Looks good in any place and any time. Good choise for an early morning running and swim.
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,One of the best beaches ever. White sand crystal clear seas and a lovely walk from one end to the other.
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,Best Ever....loved it. Not too packed lots of activities clean warm sea beach bars loungers volleyball...go down to the shack shops at the end of beach...great bargains x
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,White sand blue ocean what else! But the problem is that they offer and want money for everything pics mamajuana bottles is better to say no!
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,Nice white sands beach. Nice atmosphere. Clean and Relaxing. You can walk for miles..........".......
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,beach and pool lounge chairs were hard on your back if you have back problems. cushions were needed. then it would have been perfect
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,The sand is so soft I could lay around in it all day. Played beach volleyball with some Russians. Dove for the ball a few times and rolled around on the ground. Didn't mind it one bit. The sand feels so nice. Who needs lounge chairs?
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,There are people trying to sell jewelry but are very friendly and never pushy. I ended up buying a pair of beautiful earrings and they gave me a free bracelet.
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,We stayed at the Paradisus Punta Cana and could not have asked for a better location. Nice clear water and fun beaches. Our only complaint was the little bit of sea grass floating around the first 40 ft of water. We just swam past it and it was perfect.
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,The bavaro beach is what you imagine the Caribbean being like. Warm crystal clear water pure white sand. You could walk out for ages before getting too deep but still you could have a swim if you wanted to. The beach is lined with palm trees good for shade if needed and just adds to the feel of the Caribbean.
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,There was not one person at this hotel who spoke English. Not even the management. They are not helpful and not very friendly. Trying to find out something very simple was impossible. I think Mexico is just as nice they know English and treat their tourists very well. I will not go back to punta cana.
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,The beach had white sands and turquoise waters. The waters were calm enough to wade up to my neck and still see my feet. I stayed at Now Larimar and they raked the seaweed throughout the day. The Melia resort next door did not so there was a row of seaweed at the edge of the water.
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,The beech is like being in paradise the sea is warm sometimes choppy workers their all day keeping the beech clean
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,This is one of the most beautiful beaches I have been to. It is clean and smooth and you can walk for miles. The water is warm and is wonderful to swim in and is that beautiful turquoise colour we all dream about! Scuba and snorkeling are not too far away from the resorts.
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,ever thing there was nothing that ticked any of my boxes I should haved listened to what other travellers said on trip adviser said ive been to dom rep before and loved it but not at IFA hotels
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,We loved the beach and the sand at this beach. The beach at Palma Real was very private. The palm trees on the beach are just so unique and provide an additional character that is often overlooked. We cannot wait to return.
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,Felt safe . never expected the sea to be so warm or the beach to be so clean. All inclusive n the beach with our hotel which was a bonus. Plenty of water sports if you like that kind of thing . Would definitely recommend a visit.
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,I loved that the beach was clean! There was never any trash floating about in the sand or in the water.
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,We visited the beach on May 19th for the day... not exactly to our liking. Getting there was pretty straight forward but parking was difficult and way too many vendors constantly bothering you with their wares. Guess they have to make a living but still a few firm polite 'No Thank Yous" were not sufficient.
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,My family has visited this hotel for 12 years now and I can honestly call it my second home. It has the most friendly staff beautiful beach/pool and it is the most entertaining resort I have ever been to. I HIGHLY recommend Iberostar Bavaro to everyone.
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,Beach was lovely white sand it's a massive beach but if u like walking its great 2 walk of all the food & drink!!!
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,Skip Manati Park. It's very expensive. Pictures on DVD cost $70.00 However it was a great experience swimming with the dolphins.
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,Nice and clean beach waves were perfect not too dangerous! You can also walk along the beach and see all of the beautiful hotels which line it
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,Only two other beaches would round out my top 3 with Bavaro now being in it. Beautiful white sand and calm beautiful water with palm trees lining the landscape. I may just have to return to this beautiful beach again in the future. Stay at the Iberostar Grand hotel. AMAZING>
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,Gorgeous Beach!!!! Beautiful beach!!! Fantastic beach!!! Super clean water white powder like sand. You can walk and walk and walk...I was on the beach from 5:00 am till 6:00 pm and still wanted more :-)
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,Miles of stunning white sand and turquoise ocean. Would be nice to see some beach bars spring up along the beach as would make nice change from your hotel and well needed as those beach walks get hot. Great beach.
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,Bavaro beach is fantastic - warm blue sea rolling in fine white sand clean broad and goes on for miles!
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,Beach is simply amazing and the water is breathtaking. Not much selling on the beach from the locals so you don't have to worry about being swamped with jewelry.
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,beautiful white sand beaches. easy tide not too rough. in May when my husband & I traveled to the DR the tide brought in a bit of seaweed from time to time. other than that the water was very clear and the beaches were beautiful. supersoft sand.
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,The Bavaro Beach is beautiful and clean. The water is very clear and the sand is wonderful. The only bad thing is the venders don't understand the word NO until you say it at least 10 times.
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,I can't say enough about these beaches - been there the past 7 years and I can't get enough. Beautiful sunset and and long walks are just the best.
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,The ocean was very warm but there was quite a lot of seaweed washed on the beach. There was plenty of water activities available from parasailing to glass bottom boat and catamaran tours.
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,beach water I liked everything there...people are very friendly the food in Gourmet Restaurant is very special...pools are nice...stuning
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,Clean white sand amazing ocean warm and calm. Even not being the Caribbean Sea looks the same. The only issue is the sellers in the beach trying to selling you travel packages rides etc all the time.
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,There was nothing to dislike. The water was warm and our beach at the Princess Bavarro resort was pristine!
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,nothing to dislike long stretch of soft white sand (sea a little rough some days) but it is the Atlantic! palm trees and no hassle from looky looky men brilliant
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,great for all. the mabel is great fun big inflated armchair being pulled by speedboat good security
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,It was great to be able to take long walks on beach every day. The sand was like baby powder. The water was blue green and warm.
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,Beautiful beach with moderate waves and fine sand. Excellent to tan read a book have a few drinks or engage in beach activities.
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,Love this beach! very soft sand no shells and clear calm waters. Not many sellers but enough pass by to get any souvenirs.
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,Crystal clear waters excellent water temperature soft sand constant breeze. Went in May they were not too crowded. This is paradise!!!
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,I love the beach it was great service the lunch and dinner was just right where you want it. The bar was near for the fastest reach when you need a drink. I love the little stoire around the pool incase you need a sunblock or a little something for the pool. or even to bring back home.
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,Beautiful beach but always very crowded.......first come first serve. Sand very pure and great for walking.
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,Beautiful blue green water and lovely sands by our beach section. You will get some selling going on just tell no. no bother.
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,This is a beautiful and very clean beach! Had a chance to experience everyday staying at the Barcelo Bavaro Resort.
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,beach has nice sand but lots of seaweedin the ocean limits the visibility and clearness of the water. Walking down the beach you will be hounded by vendors but no one is too pushy
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,Beautiful sand and warm water. Well groomed. Liked the palms and the shade they provided. There was lots to do activities reading and some locals selling their wares.
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,Plenty of palm trees if you need shade. Not bothered by vendors. Very relaxing great service even on the beach. Chairs were always clean. Just loved it.
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,Beautiful sand and water. The kind of sand that is soft fine and does not get hot on your feet. Great walking beach too.
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,It really is an absolute treasure bit busy in places but no wonder if you move down from the masses at the Bahia hotels you can get a very quiet spot and the sea is perfectly turquoise.
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,It was nice soft sand and no smelly seaweed or rubbish also sandy to walk into the sea no stones. It's a nice walk to the flee market but make sure you take water
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,Excellent beach huge territory with a big amount of places to see and do - restaurants theaters forest area football (soccer) field tennis courts golf casino ect. I would definitely go back to this hotel in a heartbeat.
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,Beautiful! The ocean is clear and warm. No waves. Lots of fun. There was some seaweed however still enjoyed the beach.
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,Very little debris around cleaned shore daily. You could walk along the beach for a long way and enjoy the weather and scenery
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,This beach is beautiful. It had a lot of activities.. Some women were walking around nude it has free wifi and a cigar shop.
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,Excellent value friendly people! Definitely we will be back. Especially because of the staff and the location but also because of the golf.
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,Water was clear with wonderful view. Beach was well taken care of. It was clean but needs more beach chairs.
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,beautiful views bright sunshine clean beach clean pools great service for drinks on beach/pool warm ocean waters light breeze fun water sports included hilarious activities coordinator trying to get you to participate in beach/pool events
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,Love the turquoise waters and white sugary sand. Nice long stretch for walking. Only downside is it's getting a bit crowded as Punta Cana becomes more popular.
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,Amazing beach sand great and water warm wide beach just great. we will be returning to this area shortly and cannot wait to get back on this beach
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,Great stretch of beach for walking. Water was warm sand always cool under feet. Could be a bit windy as day goes on but who complains while looking at that gorgeous water?!
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,The hotel was already a bit older but the room we had was sufficient for us. The gardens we find very well-kept. And the staff was always friendly and helpful
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,Very crowded along resorts but very beautiful... sand quality is 5/5 water was various colors of blue maybe 5 or 6 different shades very beautiful
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,Huge beach with tons of open sand and ocean. Great waves to play in after our tour with the Bavaro Runners. Other tours were there but there was so much beach to share you didn't really run into them.
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,It has a little too much seaweed in parts but the beach is always clean and the water was crystal clear.
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,The view is beautiful also the beaches on Bavavro Princess resort were alot cleaner than the others. We have walked up and down the beach and saw alot of debris and smaller beach area. Ours were the best!
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,The rooms are fabulous with A / C Super The attention is amazing Cleaning is super great I recommend it 100% The beach is super clean as were the pools I love it !!
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,Plenty of room beautiful water and sand just lovely. Having a shopping area at the end of the beach was also a nice bonus.
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,We stayed at an all-inclusive resort that was on the beach and spent time there lounging and went for many walks down the wonderful beach. There were plenty of activities for people of all ages as well as warm clear water to play in. The waves were a blast!
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,clean and beautiful with loads of activities loved it all. amazing views and trees. People around quiet and very peaceful.
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,Resort was clean. Food was great people were friendly and you felt safe. They just need a little more help at the front desk when very busy.
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,I booked a all inclusive vacation at an Adults Only Royal Service so called resort with a private beach that was tightly crammed into two family beach with kids screaming on both sides. The beach was nice but full of traffic and the peddlers were annoying.
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,It is breathtaking. Even though at some spots there may be a few people trying to sell you things- some of their items are pretty cool.
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,beautifuloutstandingstunning the words are less to describe this placethe place is so a=beautiful the white sand the light blue water i went mad after seeing .......there was hardly any debris..i just felt amazing here wish to come back soon
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,Great for long beach walks. Quite busy area but interesting to watch boats etc. Palm trees line the beach
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,Very pretty white sand the beach has a beautiful color and there was hardly any debris out. Unlike other beaches the beach had no seashells so if you're looking for that.. look elsewhere.
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,The beach is beautiful. White sand and water that has a few blues to its color. You can see the bottom the water is so clear. Was the best beach I have ever been to.
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,Beautiful white sand beach nice waves but very swimmable. Clean crystal clear water which is just beautiful. You can walk on the beach for miles.
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,Miles and miles of beach to walk - market within walking distance but watch your bartoring of prices. Hotel prices were actually lower than market even after getting price down.
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,beautiful white sandnice breezes and clean. waiters with drinks all dayfood court and bar nearby. PERFECT !!!
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,Great to walk ...easy to get into...normally smooth wave action . and lots of sites and people if you like to people watch
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,great beach with bright water! If you are in Punta Cana you can't miss this beach! Be ready for the drug dealers if you leave the resort area though.
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,Beautiful and clean but don't like the locals who are constantly trying to sell you something. Visitors should be able to walk and enjoy the beach without constant harraasment.
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,This beach ranks in my top five ever. What I love about this stretch of the Dominican is that you can walk or in my case run for miles. The sand and scenery are harmonious and create a perfect setting for the perfect R&R vacation.
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,The hotel grounds food and atmosphere were great. Everyone says hello with a smile There are shows in the hotels every night which you have total access to. Shopping at the beach bazaar is fun- with great deals if you bargain. The pools and beach are spotless. You can't help but be happy the entire time! Will go there again.
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,Very clean...some areas are not the best but most of the beach is great!!! There are many nice resorts along this area as well as a shopping market.
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,This beach is incredible! The ocean is so warm and the sand is like cornstarch. You can walk for miles and miles past the various resorts along the beach.
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,Last year the beach was nasty with seaweed but they have added a barrier and made a very sweet beach swimming area.
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,Bavaro Beach is a beautiful sandy beach. We were there from January 26 to February 5 2016. The water was warm and the color was gorgeous! There were lots of lounge chairs to use while out in the sun. It was a great beach to go to.
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,This beach goes on and on for miles. This is a beautiful beach and there are lots of people on it. Lots of little shops where people will ask you to stop in and take a look.
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,Nice white soft sand pretty water lots of seaweed. Well maintained beach with plenty of shade from trees.
g147293,d215733,February 12 2016,My wife and I are huge beach lovers but we just could not enjoy Bavaro Beach because of the sargassum problem. Although the resort tried it's best to keep up with it the smell of rotting seaweed destroyed the beach experience.
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,Lovely sandy beach that stretches for miles. Sand is well tended by the resorts in general we were at the Caribe Princess and found the beach gently sloping and easily swim able although the sea was a bit rough in our first week at Christmas 2015. Water seems clean.
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,Beautiful long white sand lined beach with many tall palm trees. Awesome for enjoying long walks along the ocean waves.
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,Goes for miles! White sand not hot to walk on. A selection of shacks like a little shopping mall! Nice to walk along viewing all the different hotels. Various water sports to take part in. Water can be quite choppy and waves strong so be careful if not confident in water.
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,Loved the beach not too many waves. Always a breeze to keep you from getting too hot. I read before the trip about seaweed we did not see this as a problem as the beach was cleaned daily
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,This beach is amazing. It goes on for a few miles and it is breathtaking. I would highly recommend choosing a resort on this beach.
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,Beautiful beach a bit too much sea grass...but the water was perfect and the beach and colors were stunning.
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,White sandy beach peferct temp water with little waves gorgoeus waters and never over crowded. I can't wait to go back!!
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,I love this beach. Not packed with people very beautiful. The beach is deep and lovely. This was the best part of staying at this hotel.
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,I liked everything about this beach. Hard packed sand making for pleasurable walking and crystal clear water ...
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,Clean warm water parts are a bit rocky but still a great beach. Not too many people on the beach so you can really relax and enjoy yourself.
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,I keep coming back to Bavaro Beach from Michigan. Great resorts great people great place. A little sea grass when it's windy and high tide but soft sand and warm water make it perfect
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,Beautiful warm waters and powder-like sand. Did not appreciate the people trying to pull you into the shopping centers. They line the beach and can be very annoying.
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,White sand blue water and sunny skies!! What more can I say? A welcome site for these Pennsylvanians!
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,Great beach flanked with hotels at every price point. Other than many ugly Russian gift shops the beach hawkers were not pushy at all
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,Stopped at the beach while waiting for fishing trip... A perfect beach! Green/blue water and white sand with the boats floating in the perfect picture...
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,Bavaro beach truly is a scene from a postcard. The kind of beach you'd be expecting to experience on a visit to the Caribbean.
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,

g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,Soft Sand beautiful water light breeze whats not to love? there is a reef about 200 yards offshore that break up the waves so the water is usually pretty calm.
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,The beach is very clean and a beautiful site. The water temperature is warm like a pool in the summer. It wasn't exactly crystal clear as I had hoped. The waves swept in a lot of sand but it was still wonderful. The waves could get large and sometimes that was rough but it didn't hinder anyone not to swim.
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,Hubby and I have been to Mayan Riveria Cancun Mazatlan Los Cabos Puerta Vallerta Mexico and about 15 miles north of the Bavaro area in Punta Cana. The Princess has the best beach ever - light golden sand no shells no rocks warm refreshing ocean water gentle waves no seaweed no fish near beach. Solid sand for easy beach walking.
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,Beach is amazing with white sand and the palms all over. You do not need an umbrella because of the palms.
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,Clean white sand and clear Caribbean Water. Not great for finding shells but who needs those when you have cold beer sun and water?
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,Best beach ever! Whitest  softest sand and bluest waters! Very relaxing. Watching the boats and activities in the water was fun.
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,Very clean smooth sand... easy to walk out about 50 feet . Lots of coral and sea urchins. Did some snorkeling
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,The Melia Caribe Tropical All Inclusive Resort was great and the beaches were among the best in the Caribbean.
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,Bavaro beach is one of the nicest cleanest beaches we've been to. The water is the most beautiful blue I've ever seen.
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,The water was perfectly warm and never too busy. The sand got hot but was great and it was always very clean. Everything was very close to the resort and other activities which was great.
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,The nicest beach I've visited. Soft white sand not too crowded yet accessible. Don't forget to get out early to find shaded seating and bring more than enough sun screen.
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,The beach is the best I've ever been to. The sand was soft and free of sharp rocks. The water was the most beautiful green/blue water - bath warm.
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,The most stunning beach. So clean plenty of beds. The sea is amazing although the waves can be a bit high but if you like that then you will love it. Don't no what else to say but totally amazing go and check it out.
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,Everything.!!!!!...the cleanliness of the sand the temperature of the water at the time we were there the general feeling of fun in the sun the sun beds at the platinum beach area......
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,The best beach .Remodeled for Adults only. Quiet. You have to use the Restaurants facilities of Barceló Bavaro Palace for best food (Included too.)
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,The title says it all. The beaches are really nice. You can do scuba diving not the best place in the world but good enough for spend good time with the family and in contact with Nature.
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,We took a snorkeling excursion at this beach and the water was very calm and clear. Beautiful beach with shopping and restaurants.
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,Beautiful beaches light blue water that is warm no matter what time of day and perfect white sand.
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,The water was so blue. I enjoyed swimming and the white/pink sand. I would have been worried about having my children with me because there were many topless women..
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,Wonderful beach - clean white sand. Can walk for hours here liked everything here. Can be a bit busy
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,Beautiful beach - white sands turquoise waters. One of the best beaches I have been to. Would highly recommend going there
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,As an extension from my Secrets Royal Beach Review the Bavaro beach was exceptionally clean. It was spacious and full of life. I'm particularly not fond of seaweed... and it is in abundance in the water. Nevertheless I enjoyed my Sunday. I have the tan to prove it. Don't forget sunblock!
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,The beach was great very clean plenty of shade and plenty of chairs. Daily activities were fun the staff was very friendly and tried to get eveyrone involved
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,Liked the service at the beach from the Now Larimar Staff. The beach was good but nothing spectacular.
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,Beautiful clean sand. Always loungers available nice breeze to keep you cool. There were a lot if passers by on the beach but perfect for people watching!
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,Lovely beach white sand clean and beautiful water. Lots of activity and it was great to lie on. A few peddlers but not too bad compared to other beaches.
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,Beach was good. Same was the only nice thing about it. It was like talcum powder. The natives next store who owned the little shops were like 5th century peasant barbarians. They were very nasty and pushy. Mostly Haitians.
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,The beach was very nice but a lot of sea weeds because there were storms. The color of the water was beautiful blue green.
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,I felt safe..I love the view the water green/blueish color and the cleanness. Warm and pool type water.
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,If you like the ocean and enjoy walking the beach.....AND like to people-watch you can't do better than Bavaro Beach
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,The best beach in Dominican . White sand blue waters and gradual beach slope very safe to swim Bahia principay has the best section . Sun rise is amazing to watch.
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,The green sea and white sand! Especial to walk early morning! Rest lying in front of Caribe sea! Drink President beer!
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,I've been to resorts on this beach 4 times and have only nice things to say. The beach is clean has white sand and the water close to it is generally clean. There are usually enough beach chairs to get comfortable and not too many beach vendors.
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,loved it all...pure white sand and turquoise seas :) Warm sunshine and blue skies..a perfect place for all the family and couples..perfect for weddings on the beach
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,Soft sandy beach which was always kept clean and Blue sea and Sky my idea of heaven. This beach was just great for a strollswim or just to watch people enjoying life from the hustle and bustle of their everyday lives.
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,Plenty of chairs/umbrella's for everyone!! Soft white sand and warm blue water...what's not to love?
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,Bavaro beach was amazing! Watch out for topless females if you have younger children. (It's normal for europeans)
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,One of the cleanest beaches I've ever been. White sands calm waters and hardly any sea weed. Stayed at Paradisus Palma Real. Can't wait to return.
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,I have been to this resort before and the beach is fab I have never stayed at this hotel and will be travelling there on 01.05.14. Iam a bit concerned over the negative reviews
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,lots of white sand but no fish when you snokel. A beautiful stretch of beach that is unspoilt by tourism.
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,The beauty and the relaxation. I'm looking forward to revisiting Grand Bahia Principe Premier in the near future.
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,I liked everything about this resort  I will return . Suggest upgrading to platinum Great people  great service
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,The beach here is so clean and the sand is so white. The sea is warm and quite shallow here but shelves gently as you go further out which you should only do if you are a competent swimmer. Very nice are for a spot of sunbathing and a quick dip to cool off.
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,Loved the soft beautiful sand and turquoise clear water. The current was abit strong during our visit so we didn't venture out too far. I loved that there were no rocks when wading.
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,Bavarro Beach was a very good location. The servers waited on us all day. The hospitality was second to none.
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,Bavaro Beach has that white powder soft sand that you think about when you dream about a beach vacation. The ocean floor has the same sand but is firmly pack and the water is turquoise blue which makes for the best ocean swimming. Simply the best.
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,The actual beach is great. The fine white sand and the clear light blue water. I would rather go to Macao beach or the North Coast of the DR where there are a lot less people so I can enjoy the surroundings the water and the beach.
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,Clean and clear beach. Not rough. At the hotel we did not have the hustlers trying to sell us anything.
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,disliked the fact that bavaro is sooooooo far from the beach.trains run often enough to get you there.also by the time you find out where everything isyour times almost up.definately book all ala carte rest.as soon as possible and make one of them Maikowas hibachi .
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,The ocean colors are beautiful changing from an almost clear light blue to a darker green the deeper out we ventured. Living on the East Coast of the United States we are used to waves and occasional undertows so we weren't bothered by the rough surf on this beach.
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,I tried to do the early morning beach stroll every day because it was so gorgeous. The water crazy soft sand and of course the people watching made it a fun and relaxing way to burn off some of those yummy tropical drinks. We were pretty excited to find fantastic snorkeling right by our hotel!
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,Bavaro beaches have the right temperature to enjoy the ocean and the quietness of a paradise with an awesome view! Also the little local town is friendly and fun to visit.
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,Like you see on a postcard the sand is white the water is clear turquoise and clean. Love this beach above the many we’ve been to.
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,sand is beautiful and beach is deep...staff are always cleaning the beach. hard to walk on though because of the market people constantly approaching you to come into their markets...they can be quite aggressive.
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,Amazing powder white sand beach with a reef.Nearly always windy and ruff water  so no good for snorkeling.
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,Some areas on the beach have more algae than others but where there is none water is clear in turquoise color a real warm pool in a white sand beach. Marvelous !
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,nice deep beach you can walk on for ever without being hassled by people trying to sell you stuff. sand is always soft
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,I was amazed by how white and fine the sand was and it is kept clean by hard-working people who keep raking and cleaning it all day long!
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,the beach is very well maintained and the water was fabulous. Need to get up really early to score yourself a palapa---and they offer massages on the beach in a cabana
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,Very clean beach with sea weed a slight problem but the resort clean them up on a daily. They have wonderful white cool sand unlike in Mexico where it can be too hot to walk on.
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,This beach is simply beautiful white sands with lots to eat and do. We had fresh Grouper and Lobster on the beach for $40.00. Lots of shopping and activities for kids to do. Didn't like the pushy vendors!!
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,Beautiful white sand beach lots of lounging options in the shade or sun and the water is unreal! Shades of aqua and dark blue. Always a nice sea breeze to keep cool as well.
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,this is the most beautiful beach you will ever encounter. White sand  shark free due to coral reef.
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,very clean and beautiful. lot of people but not too overcrowded. beautiful and very long beach for walk
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,Very nice location with beautiful views. Not much seaweed and mostly clean. Great for swimming tanning and long walks.
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,Warm crystal clear waters...what more do you need? How bout the drink guy yelling "drinky drinky" and handing you a drink all day long? Perfection!
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,I'm very hard in this review because Punta Cana / Bavaro is nice when you are at the resort(s) but once outside there is not much original Dominican to discover. A town ? well 60 miles away and not so clean so nothing for tourists.
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,Nice clean beach. Felt there should be a lot more chairs and in the sun more with shelters. Dislike---if you were not at the beach by 6am impossible to have a beach seat. Towels were placed very early. Many times people never came back to the seats until late in the day which seems unfair.
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,this is by the best beach ive been one. we stayed at the iberostar Dominican the beach there is so clean. the white soft sand is outstanding you can walk for miles on this beach
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,Banana boating was super fun and was at the hotel. They had other activities such as snorkeling kayaking and using a catamaran.(Prices vary). Most of the beach was without seaweed but some parts in the ocean had a little bit. And the water was clear!
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 11 2016,Beach is absolutely amazing palm trees white sand blue water and extremely good service of ice drinks. Love it. Love it
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,Very clean and well kept! Not too crowded when we were there and we always found chairs in the areas where we wanted to sit.
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,Adult only all inclusive is the way to go for a quiet or eventful trip where our biggest decision was where to eat for dinner.
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,Beautiful spacious and large beach! One of the most amazing beach! Would go back tomorrow Theirs waves not to much sea weeds
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,Awesome! I will be returning to Punta Cana again! Everyone should visit here!! Marvelous..Fun.. Relaxing!
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,I loved bavaro beach. The sea is beautiful and calm The palm trees provide shade and the sade is nice and soft.
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,Bavaro is still one of the longest and cleanest beaches for walking. Nice and sandy for swimming. This was my second visit to Punta Cana and the main reason was for Bavaro beach.
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,The beach is a absolutely breathtaking site. Very safe and of course the incredible colors of the water with the breeze make it an a wonderful place to relax or walk. Gladly return.
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,A wonderful and beautiful beach. Visited here for our 31st anniversary. We stayed at The Reserve atParidus palma. Beautiful and well ran facilty. Rooms are beautiful grouds are amazing.
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,yep... the bavaro beach is the best one but try to keep as close as the RIU and Iberostar company as possible.
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,Beach is a short few steps from the pol area and water has soft waves. walking the beach was pleasant.
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,Perfect white sand and turquoise waters relax on the sun loungers or enjoy the many water sports / excursions available
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,Parts of the beach have a bit of silt and seaweed on them so makes it a little difficult to swim but OH the views. Can't be beat would go back in a heartbeat.

g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,The color of the ocean was amazing. There was always chairs to use. The beach was clean. The sand was so soft on my feet. There were many palm trees around making you feel you were truly in paradise!
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,Palm trees and huts all over the beach miles to walk coral and sand and FISH everywhere to see when snorkeling. Amazing.
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,wonderful beach goes on forever ruff water however they are building a lagoon so people can enjoy the water more
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,Beautiful scenery nice sand and you can walk barefoot comfortably for kilometers - literally. One of the nices features is that it is lined with Coconut Palms.
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,great place good food very clean only fault not enough sunbeds on the beach would love to re-visit sometime.
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,We really loved the beach this is the reason why we go back to Punta Cana. Beautiful white sand and clear blue water. Absolutely stunning.
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,Nice and safe to walk along not bothered by beach sales. The sea appeared to be protected by a reef and the state is controlled by flags.
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,clean butler service beach fast food available. There was a place called Cafe del Mar that was in the middle of the beach but not included in the all inclusive That part i wasn't fussy about.
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,Soft Powder Sand which is never hot to walk on. Amazing turquois water. Water is warm and not to rough. It is also not overcrowded
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,Little more seaweed than expected but the sand was so soft and palm trees were amazing. I've been to many carribean islands and have never seen anything like that. (growning right out of the center of the beach)
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,Beautiful white soft sandy beach! Clean with no rocks. Some of the most beautiful ocean water I have ever seen!
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,sand and beach clean and awesome water has some big rocks in it - be carefully - we snorkeled about 30 feet from shore - you only see a few fish but free and fun
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,Enjoyed the calm waters and soft white sand of Bavaro Beach. Very long stretch of beach perfect for long walks. Very clean!
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,This white sand beach just goes on and on. Great weather. Warm water. Awesome!! We walked and walked for more than two hours each way. The sunrise was beautiful and well worth getting up early for. The locals left you alone to enjoy the place and all its beauty without any hassle.
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,the beaches were amazing and wonderful warm water :) spent all day enjoying our time in the water and tanning in the sun :)

g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,The beach was breath taking. The water is so clear and the sand is perfect. The only con was the street peddlers you had to deal with.
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,Very long beautiful beach all sand no rocks to worry about. The water is very warm and clean and if the wind comes up the waves are awesome.
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,Loved the Bavaro Adventure: speed boats snuba and scuba - all for $99 - totally worth it and was only half a day.
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,A bit crowded. Hard to find a beach chair in the shade. Lots of people watching. Take a nice walk up and down the beach. Strike up a conversation with your neighbor.
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,The sand was perfect and the water was so clear. There were even sea urchins in the shallow water that we got to hold!

g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,a GREAT beach--lots of white sand crystal clear and warm water. great for swimming. no snorkeling nearby.
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,Gorgeous soft sand you can walk for miles the only downside is a bit of seaweed some days worse than others.
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,I am a beach person. And I went to a lot of beach destinations in the world.And no doubts Bavaro Punta Cana is the best beach ever. So beautiful. A paradise. Going there for 6years already.
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,Clean sand (very little trash just a little sea grass) clear water with good afternoon winds for sailing!
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,It's meticulously maintained and clean long the Barcelo Bavara Beach stretch where we stayed. There is terrific swimming and lots of activities. I was there a week and only once did I see any garbage and it was a small plastic bag that likely blew out of someone's lunch bag. Soft sand and lovely blue water. Amazing waterfront.
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,mature tall palm trees blazing white sand long sand bar into ocean all within 20 min of the airport.......outstanding
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,We loved how well kept the beach was! There was no litter and lots of beauty to be found. I can't wait to go back!
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,Beautiful sandy beach although it was if a little crowded at times. The sea became deep very quickly so maybe not ideal for young children
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,cleaned everyday a good walk up and down the beach. the sea was so warm. Sadly a fight for the sun beds you have to get up early to get one.
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,beach protected by coral reef...amazing crystal blue and green water no jellyfish lovely palm trees!
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,This is the best beach for the location of Punta Cana Resorts. Magnificent white and clean sand. Turquoise color and warm ocean water
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,Luxurious white sand that's not even hot on your feet. Watch out for the locals trying to take you the "mall" It's safe but they can be annoying.
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,The beach is seemingly endless with deep sand and fairly free of vendors in front of the resorts. The weddings I shoot on Bavaro Beach are always gorgeous especially as the sun sets over those beautiful palm trees. Great work Punta Cana you have an amazing beach attraction. My favourite beach without question.
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,good for long walks . Some places had sea grass and you can snorkel right off shore and see lots of fish. During your walks you can cool off in the beautiful clear water walk one way on deserted stretches or the other past hotels and people watch.one of the nicest I have experienced
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,Good for walks swims and lots of people watching. Great way to spend lazy days. Take off and walk both directions dip in and out of the ocean.
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,warm water white sand.Lovely.Not too busy.Would have liked it to be more secluded but was a gorgeous beach. Felt safe in the sea.No sharks or big scary fish!! highly recommended
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,Beautiful beaches one can walk for miles . The locals selling products on the beach are a pain in the _ _ _ but hey they have to live to and a simple no is suffice to fend them off ( dicker prices to what you wand to pay always works .)
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,I walked on this beach while staying at the Gran Bahia Ambar and you walk for miles and see all the hotels front in the area. There is also lots of activities you can do here. The nice warm water and big waves is fun. Just don't go at night. Very busy during the day.
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,Probably my favorite beach to visit. Turquoise waters warm breeze soft powdery sand etc. If you haven't visited Bavaro Beach be sure to put it on your to do list!
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,A beautiful beach with whitepowdery sand and warm clear blue/green water. Look around and you can find coral pieces in the water but you don't have to worry about cutting your feet...the bigger pieces are buried in the bottom of the ocean. Relaxing atmosphere with only a slight breeze. I loved it!
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,Nice clear blue water. There wasn't any seaweed. The salt water was very refreshing and didn't even feel like I was swimming in salt water.
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,Immaculate! with an exceptional staff. Just a spectacular escape to paradise!. We loved the service and grounds and suites and beach the large pool w/ swim up bar and especially our swim up bar staff! Amazing group of people!
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,Beach was very clean and water was clear. There is a large reef so there aren't any waves. Kids found large starfishes sea urchin and other sea life while snorkeling. Beach is very busy with lots of people and water sports.
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,The beach is beautiful. White powder sand that is flat and it is easy to walk on for miles. The palm trees provide some shade. The water is crystal clear and warm. No sales people on the beach. They have a section Shopping mall that you can go to if you want to shop. They don't bother you.
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,The beach is stunning the water is clean and clear. There was a little more seaweed than I expected.
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,Great beach nice white sand.Lots of entertainment not a lot of beach vendors which was great.Was fair amount of seaweed but they were working hard to keep it cleaned.
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,Just advise against when its spring break..lol Service foold and rooms were awesome. Water was beautiful.
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,Bavaro Beach is a excellent place for vacation but now is too crowed. Is not anymore the quite place the use to be. Really had lost the atmosphere. But is the price the have to pay for the success . You can find good place in the front beach like Jelly Fish and have a good lunch a good bath.
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,Woww the beach was excellent! Pure white sand and cristal clear blue sea palm trees and a breeze made it perfect.
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,Over the past couple of years we have been to Hawaii Mexico and St. Lucia and this was byfar our favorite beach. The water was clean warm and it went on for miles. My husband loved the sand!
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,excellent place to stay everyone was great the beach was beautiful food was great weather was fantastic.
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,You can walk this palm tree lined white sandy beach for hours and swim in the tropical warm water. I have been here twice and would go back. I would highly recommend visiting Punta Cana's Bavaro Beach
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,Disapointed. Not clean. No long chairs available at hotels (nor ours). Lots of sales persons on the beach they even grab you by the hand or arm. Way to invading. Water was hot period.
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,The food quality and selection were excellent.The beach is lovely albeit somewhat crowded good facilities pleasant grounds and well maintained facilities. Arrived in a peak period beach was very congested. The staff are helpful and seemed accustomed to meeting the demands of many vacationers.
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,Very clean spacious. A great place to take a long walk. Make sure you remember where your resort is a you can walk forever and not even realize it !
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,Wonderful white sand beaches! Some of the cleanest beach I have ever seen; even the ones that were not part of a resort.
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,white clean sand with lots of coconut tree everywhere I have been almost every where in Mexico but sofar this is one of best beaches I have ever been.... no more Mexico
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,Water had a lot of needle like seaweed in it that accumulated on the beach. They did clean it daily. Water was pretty warm and clear. Beach area stretched for ever. Special are for the vendors and they can get pretty pushy
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,White sand bali beds roving bar tenders blue Carribean Sea. Warm water to swim in. A nice walk in 83 degree weather with a gentle breeze.
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,We got up for the sunrise one morning to find a man guarding the beach with a rifle. Interesting...the sunrise was amazing!! The sand is like baking powder and very clean beach. Loved it!
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,Great sand great warm water with reasonable waves. Stories of people trying to get you to buy stuff is a complete non-factor.
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,Beautiful beach had some rough seas for 1 day but otherwise ocean was calm. Just watch for the rocks!
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,Had a great time beautiful white sandy beach with turquoise blue water.well maintained resort. Would love to go back.
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,Beautiful clear water soft sand. Sections are a bit crowded but there is always a place further away and a walk on the beach is great.
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,Lovely white sand and turquoise sea! A little busy but plenty of water sports available.Lots of shadier areasunder palm trees.Hotel refreshment bars just off beach and waiter service to your sun-lounger occasionally.
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,Loved the ocean. Spent 6 out of 7 days in it. Very clean no sea weed. I snorkelled everyday and luckily out near the buoy lines is a coral reef.
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,Loved the staff and Platinum club. Didn't like the shuttles as we often had to wait. Resorts and grounds were beautiful.
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,Warm water beautiful sand which doesn't get hot! Lots of water sports available. Walk along the beach to do some shopping at the local artisan shops.
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,Beautiful and great walking beach. Like a post card. Warm tropical water several miles long. Sandy with beautiful scenery to look at and all of those palm trees makes it a post card picture.
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,One of the nicest beaches I have seen in the Caribbean. the beachfront at the Iberostar Grand Bavaro was lovely.
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,Stayed at the VIK hotel on Bavaro beach... gorgeous!! Bavaro beach is pure white sand and blue blue water. A little rougher because it is on the Atlantic side... great waves to play in!
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,Waves aren't too hard at most parts of the beach. Some people will try and sell you things or coax you into their stores but they weren't too forceful. Beautiful blue water white sand what more could you ask for?
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,Soft white powder sand & beautiful turquoise water. You can walk miles and miles without a problem. Several open markets right on the beach.
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,You can walk for miles on this beach - very few hawkers who are not rude or pushy. Sea is blue and warm and clean apart from bits of weed but it is not a problem.
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,Bavaro Beach is beautiful. My husband and I loved to walk on the beach during the days we were there.
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,Every thing was excellent could not have asked for anything better  first time there but will go back
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,Everything was satisfactory. Hand rails should be installed at the pool steps very slippery for seniors and hard to maneuver.
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,Bavaro Beach is beautiful with soft fine sand the water is warm and the beach always seemed very clean.
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,you will be amazed at how beautiful this beach is. the sand is so soft on your feet and the water as long as its not a stormy day is crystal clear
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,Brilliant beach for relaxing and hitting the waves..... No complaints very safe area for all ages beach clean and no litter around the place.
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,Great beach clean and no need to stress over a sun lounger. sea is nice and a few shops and a few bars where you can have all sorts of drinks. weather was lovely too!
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,it was nice and sunny. the beach was kind of crowded. It was my first day on the island and I was exploring. I would recommend checking it out.
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,My wife and I have been to other places but this beach is by far the best! There are miles and miles of beach to just walk and enjoy.
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,A beautiful beach with white sand and palm trees. The beach is wide and long and you can walk for miles. The beach at Secret Royal Beach is always cleaned with no sea weed.
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,Beautiful resort pool closing at 7pm is too early as you don't have a chance to enjoy it if your doing anything else during the day.
g147293,d215733,February 10 2016,Nice Resort Nothing special average rooms really nice beach beautiful manicured grounds average food taste and selection staff was grumpy-Probably knew their working days were coming to an end. The place closes in April 2016. I would recommend it if your expectations are not to high
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,The beach was perfect. The resort has installed a break water to stop rough water in windy weather. Big improvement.
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,Beautiful beach!! Palm trees are breathtaking. Sand was soft and white. Only had a limited time on the beach but I would go back!
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,This beach is everything you dream about when thinking about an all-inclusive vacation. Pure white sand and clear blue water!
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,No shell hunting. Clear waters soft sand. Very pretty. Some spots have seaweed but the resorts work hard to clear it away. That problem is just seasonal. Never an issue for us.
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,Bavaro Beach is gorgeous! Great powder white sand and calm water. We stayed at Barcelo Bavaro Beach two years in a row and absolutley love it! A great part of the island!
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,Water was warm and beautiful..black pine needle looking vegetation in water washes ups on beach but constantly being raked and not much of a nuisance. Sand never feels hot!!
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,Beautiful turquoise waters you can see your feet! Junk free sand free kayakingsnorkeling.you don't have to leave beach to shop they come to you when you ask! Banana boat ride was crazy! Palm trees on beach to sit under when you don't want to get burned! Activities right on beach they water taxi you to your activity.
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,Beautiful beaches water & atmosphere. Friendly resort staff. plenty of activities. Great food. definitely a come back too!
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,Soft sandsbeautiful waters. Shoppingddrinksand excursions all can be found easily. Moses is the guy to find to help with excursions throughout the entire resort.
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,Awesome beach. White sand and turquoise water with a slight brease. Can get a little crowded but the view is awesome.
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,White sand with small amount of seaweed and tree roots on the beach but hotel properties keep their areas clean. Can walk for miles unobstructedby rockstreesor cliffs etc. 1 of my favorite beaches of the 100's I've visited world wide!
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,The beach was cleaned daily and the water was warm and calm. There were plenty of chairs so we always found a place to sit. It is a private beach so there is no venders
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,Was always cleaned and had a lot of chairs on the beach. The beach party was a blast! Wish it had more bathrooms though. A lot of walking for people who can't get around much
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,This beach was really beautiful. The sand is so soft it feels like silk on your feet. The wind off of the water makes the heat bearable if you are not accustomed to the humidity and the water is crystal clear.
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,One of the best beach in the world I travel around the world all of South America and Europe and none can beat the bavaro beach people from everywhere come to bavaro Germans Russians French from France US Canadians there must be a reason :)
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,Beach was nice quite a bit of sea grass floating during the time we stayed. But the grounds people spent time in the morning cleaning the beach even saw them with rakes and wheelbarrows during the day cleaning up the washed up sea grass
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,You could just sit on the beach play in the ocean or watch the boats. It wasn't crowded and there were plenty of beach chairs. There were two nearby restaurants and the Sports Bar was nearby.
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,I loved walking on this beach people watching enjoying the activities of the other hotels i think the seaweed could be cleaned up as makes my photos a bit scruffy
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,Beautiful white sand warm turquoise water hundreds of tall palm trees. What more can you ask for ?
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,Loved the whole wedding/vacation with the exception of the distance we were from the ocean from our villa. We had an amazing time!!
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,It was a very nice beach. Water was warm but not had a little chill at first. Water was a little rough and snorkeling wasn't great. I have seen more beautiful beaches.
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,We stay at different resorts on this beach when we visit the DR. The beach is long and wide with clean sand and beautiful fairly calm water. Tons of activities!
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,On the good side Beachsun cleanliness and entertainment. Dislikes 2 of the 4 bars Food was mediocre. Shortness of drink glasses and towels.
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,Well worth the $98.00 cost thru Apple Vacations excursion. Well run very cool experience to snorkel and swim the Nerf Sharks and Stingrays.
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,The beach was clean and had plenty to do. Lots of space for everyone. One of the many places you felt safe with the security gaurds
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,Liked everything could not find anything to dislike!! Its great for a sunrise walk or a sunset walk!! Lots of different water sports available.
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,Great accommodations great beach excellent and friendly efficient staff. Great food ..Entertaining shows nightly
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,Beautiful blue water white sand clean beach area with washrooms and nearby showers. Will go again!
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,Soft sandblue water white beach and lots of places to swim. I will definitely try and make back again :)
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,The beach is so nice its clean and the water is breathtaking. Lots of pushy salesmen though so just be firm. There are lots of fun activities to do though which is fun. Great long walk.
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,Amazing beach with awesome sand and warm water! watch out for locals selling stuff though they're everywhere!
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,Beautiful beach with no rocks. You can take long walks.It is a perfect beach. However if you want to find shells and see fish when your snorkelling this won't be your beach.
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,Very well maintained. Walkers and joggers were in abundance. Could use more Bali beds in the Colonial Club section. Bar was well stocked.
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,The beach was beautiful and well taken care of. Love going through the little shops. Wish beach in front of the shops was replaced.
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,The beach was well maintained  nice sand and best news the vendors where polite and not in your face all the time. The presence of security was also very comforting.
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,It lives up to every good review written just didn't want to take my eyes off the colour of that ocean. Beautiful soft white sand to walk on. I'm back in September to enjoy some more!
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,While not a Caribbean beach in the pictures still dang nice. Pinkish powdery sand. Vivid blue warm water. Minimal waves due to barrier reef. Seaweed and trash could build up. Our resort the Paradisus Palm Real did a great job of keeping it clean. But on our walks we saw that beach cleanliness marked the better resorts.
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,We stayed at a resort located on this beach truly great with fine white sand clear blue waters and nice shadow from the palm trees. A beach to remember and definitely return to.
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,Pros: white sand and blue water Cons: lots of noise... Too many para sailors... Lots of "saving" of beach chairs... Very annoying
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,most beautiful sand and tourqouise waters. Water was so nice and always just the right temp to cool you off from the hot weather.
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,This is a stunning beach. Extremely clean sand is soft cool even when the sun is hot. Lovely beach to walk along. The water is warm great waves lots of fun.
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,White Sand and Blue sky and sun sun sun! Beach can be crowded but the beach is beautiful and good for long walks
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,The beach is beautiful. The only downfall at the beach is that people don't pick up after themselves. I always go around and pick-up other people's garbage so that we can keep the beach clean.
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,beach is beautiful and very clean. We also went to the Macao beach and were able to go buggie boarding. It was very safe and fun!
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,It is a very long and wide beach with palm trees soft sand and many people sun tanning or mingling about.
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,Bring bug spray there are sand fleas that bite the heck out of you. Also very busy must get up at 6am to grab a chair or two.
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,Gorgeous white sandy tropical beach that goes on for miles. The water is crystal clear and really blue but a bit wavy and not as turquoise as other Caribbean destinations and it is located on the Atlantic ocean not the Caribbean sea! Still amazing nonetheless.
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,nice hot watermany tips for sports as parasailingtry local coconuts :) be carefull because of strong sun!
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,This was a great excursion we swam with the sharks held the stingrays. We then went to the beach area and swam and partied

g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,The Bavaro Beach is the jewel of the Dominican Republic. Quiet waters toward the lower end of the beach protected by a reef. Excellent snorkeling and swimming!
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,you can walk for 2 hours and still not reach the end of the beach! Stay South as it is less crowded.
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,Liked walking some of the 32 miles of white sand and talking with people from all over the world. Swimming was wonderful warm and relaxing.
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,This was the most beautiful beach I have ever been too. The water is just gorgeous the beaches white and sandy and we only saw one sea "creature" the whole time. We swam and played in the waves like little kids. Perfect.
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,Best beach I have ever seen - soft sand perfect water color just a bit rough while we were there - also did not get bothered by vendors. They were there but let you find them no nagging like in Mexico
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,Great beach at my resort. Staff friendly beach cleaned each day. Sometimes difficult to find lounger but it was ok
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,Was very clean and lots of seating. To many vendors. There was not alot of bars on the beach and more place to get towels would be nice
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,We stayed at the Tropical Princess which was right on the beach. It was Beautifulwell maintained and the Beach was amazing.The staff was friendlyhelpful and the food was very good. Yes we will definitely go back.
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,The waves are surprisingly strong but so enjoyable Water is blue like sapphires beach is clean bar service is excellent.
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,We stayed at the Grand Bahia Principe Ambar which was a quick walk to the beach. The beach was well maintained and clean. There were maintenance crews constantly cleaning to make sure that trash was picked up and that the anything seaweed that washed up was collected. Amazing beach.
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,One of nicest beaches I have visited. Sand is so soft and white. Beach seems to run along the ocean forever. Most of beach is kept very clean from rubbish and seaweed.
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,This was a great day. Speedboating scuba diving and snorkeling. You can't go wrong with this excursion.
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,best beach I have been on had lovley long walks very clean no rocks just golden sand plenty of sun beds
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,Bavaro Beach is definitely one of the nicest beaches we have every been too. The sand is like sugar so soft and white. The water was the brightest blues and greens I've seen. You can walk for miles too. It was amazing
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,To many hotels sharing the same stretch making it seem crowded. Not so keen on the time share hustlers
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,Little interruption from hawkers and sales people on beach Will definitely book another holiday here
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,Just visited Punta Cana for 5 days last week and the majority of it was spent on Bavaro Beach. Lovely white sand very clean the water was perfect for swimming with very little seaweed and nothing more than rolling waves. Great place for soaking up a few days of sun! (and if you dare go for a midnight dip!)
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,You can walk and walk and walk in any direction and the beach continues to amaze. No corral so it is not the best for scuba however the water is unreal clear and the sand is so white it never gets hot.
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,it is not a secluded or particularly quiet beach but great to walk along the water is warm and the sand is terrific! love it!
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,Lots to see & do! Safe to walk up & down the beach calm waves but lacking a view of the sunrise or sunset.
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,This is a go to beah for us!! It is close to Canada...you know 3.5 hour flight and it is always very pretty nice white sand gradual slope into the water....nice waves for fun!! Love it!! Never disappointed......yet!! Enjoy...
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,Soft sand beautiful water. Coral is not colorful however. Water temp was perfect. Windy at our location (Esmeralda) noticed it was less windy around the bend toward Hard Rock Hotel.
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,Beautiful area! Beach and ocean are spectacular. Only complaint would be the crazy shops if you leave your private beach! They will hassle you.
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,This could be anywhere in the world except it is very windy and that made it cold at times. Otherwise a pleasant location.
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,I've walked the whole beach now and just love it. Any resort is good here. A few places to shop or get a drink if you don"t mind walking the beach a little.
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,Beautiful Waters !! Had fun swimming in the water and snorkelling. Lots of beach chairs. The sand is amazing. Very soft. Only spotted some corral in the sand on different parts of our walks.
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,We loved this beach - white sand palm trees great waves for jumping and beautiful views. This is one of the nicest beaches we've ever seen.
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,Stayed at Melia located on Bavaro Beach and it was the most beautiful beach I've ever seen! I'm sure that depends on your location/resort but ours was wonderful!
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,Half day perfect you will get muddy wear swim suit and t shirt Ladys Shorts you not care if they get dirty.
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,The hard sand and the waves splashing your lower legs. The bech is over 20 miles long. There seems to be a lot of action along the beach area.
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,Just beautiful all around. Uncrowded clean no vendors or begging - perfect stretch to walk jog or just sit around.
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,I read on this that in Punta Cana Bavaro has the best beaches and there are right. in front of my resort in the ocean I saw a local digging and pulling out of the ocean floor 3 big shells.
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,Beautiful beach. Enjoyed walking this beach everyday we were there. I could just listen to the sound of the soft waves all day so relaxing. The color of the water is a beautiful shade of turquoise and blue. The sand is cool to the touch and so soft. This beach is exactly what you expect when you think of paradise.
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,The beach was just great plenty of shade if you want and plenty of lounge chairs. Just steps from our room
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,Sand was nice and warm... It felt really great between our toes. I recommend spending time on this beach soaking up the sun listening to the waves crashing on the shore. The water is nice and refreshing.
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,This is one of the best beaches I have been to. Clean sand calm waves most of the time. Who doesnt like the beach
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,Great walking beach. The waves are impressive and the sand and water were pristine but not a shell in sight.
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,The beach is beautiful soft white sand beach. Water is clean and not rough or big waves. Water sports are great fun too.
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,Very pleasant and peaceful atmosphere! First time staying at an adult only hotel. I appreciated the respect the adults showed to the staff and one another. Very conservative very private very respectful!
g147293,d215733,March 9 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 9 2016,the beach is paradise....somewhat crowded but overall I had a wonderful experience...the only think I would recommend is to get there early
g147293,d215733,March 9 2016,This is one of the softest sand beaches I have ever walked on. Absolutely beautiful with plenty of chairs to lounge on.
g147293,d215733,March 9 2016,Magnificent water white sand stay at a good resort like paradisus so worth the money the service food gym brand drinks fresh fruit and gorgeous rooms
g147293,d215733,March 9 2016,Wonderful location good food Lots of different restaurants to choose from. Rivera buffet also very good. staff friendly helpful and fun. Best holiday ever ! !4 friends and family for a 6oth birthday.
g147293,d215733,March 9 2016,No joke. We walked as much as we could and there didn't seem to be an end to the white sand. Lots of resorts on the water but never feels crowded.
g147293,d215733,March 8 2016,While staying at the The Reserve at Paradisus Palma Real we visited this part of the resort for swimming paddle boarding para sailing and kayaking.
g147293,d215733,March 8 2016,Walked that beach every day during my week and I have to say it was always a pleasure. The only possible downside would be the intrusion from the vendors but it could also be fun.
g147293,d215733,March 8 2016,Excellent winter destination and superb customer service. Can't say enough good things; just don't plan to lose weight in this place.
g147293,d215733,March 8 2016,The beach is beautifull by the Bavaro Princess hotel soft white sand that's not hot at all. The water is beautiful too clear and turqoise but with large waves and strong current so watch out for yout little ones. Water was nice and warm
g147293,d215733,March 8 2016,I can't wait to go back this April 2016. Juan Carlos and the entire staff was amazing. Me Mom and 3 Sister's had the best vacation ever. I talked my husband to take me there for my April birthday. We're booked and ready to go....I'm so excited
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,The beach is beautiful but there are many palm trees so you will be in the shadow sometimes. Good for people with sensitive skin though.
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,AWESOME fine white sand with little seaweed which was a surprise since almost everywhere is bad for seaweed lately. The ocean floor is weed and rock free.....perfect for riding the waves and frolicking in the water.
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,Great beach to go with the family or friends avoid the ambulant sellers and you'll be able to enjoy it.
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,Bavaro beach is great for suntanning. Always breezy but water is generally rough and rocky in a lot of the shore areas. There are nicer beaches in the Dominican but all in all clean but lots of vendors
g147293,d215733,February 9 2016,Clean gorgeous palm trees clean and we'll kept one of the best I have been on only downfall is the noise of thr sightseeing helicopters flying over on tours quite frequently.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Drinks and snacks brought to your lounge chair. The wait staff was very attentive and the drinks never stopped coming. Enjoyed our stay
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Group of 18 some married and single people felt very safe during day and night a lot of lighting and people around the restaurants and bars
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Nice beach at the Reserve. Private huts and the sand is great doesn't get hot. Excellent for walking also.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,AMAZING water and the sand was so beautiful. The beach was extremely pleasant to relax and enjoy the gorgeous views.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Our second visit to this area and we enjoyed both trips very much! Can't wait to go back! Friendly people beautiful beach a feeling of being "safe" and great food options! Who can ask for more?
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,We went snorkeling on the Bavaro reef. It was lots of fun and we saw quite a few fish. It was only $40.00/person for 2 hours but next time I think ill spring for the catalina island all day snorkel that was $99.00/person.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Busy place nice sandnot too many people after you do the activities such as para sail glass bottom boat  booze cruise.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Soft sand and azul blue water. I wish there would be more "stands" where you could buy just a bottle of water and some snacks without having to go into one of the restaurants/bars at the beach. Some parts of the beach there's guards coming to you and saying it's private property (hotels I guess) so choose your spot wisely.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,We liked the distances we could walk along the beach in the warm sun. Seaweed at times was one of the problems the sea was rough at times you had to watch your footing.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beach is pretty but was very crowded as there are many large resorts. There is also a sunken cargo ship right off the beach. It's far enough out that it won't affect your swim.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,This was a big part of our holiday for the reasons :- A long sandy beach Clear sea water Not many sellers to bother you Nice beds if you like them What could be better than a hot sunny day with your toes in warm sand and a happy mrs reading beside me ? Best beach we've ever seen.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Very clean beach! Plenty of loungers and huts or palm trees for shade. Could walk for miles either way!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beach was immaculate. The sand was soft white and free of debris. The clear blue water was warm and inviting. No stones shells or seaweed to contend with as workers keep this area pristine. A variety of activities were available to participate in if you so desired. This is the best beach I have ever been to.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,We were there in December. Nice weather but very windy. We walked and walked on the Beach for hours. The sand is very soft. I agree with Fireman 1963 for the only negative is the locals trying to sell excursions and bring us to their shopping center. They are very much annoying unfortunately.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beautiful beach & great weather. Only negative is the locals constantly trying to sell you excursions.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beach is fantastic clear blue sea with cane umbrellas and swaying palm trees. Had trouble getting a bed though so be prepared to get up early and put towel on bed. Beach cafe food a bit limited but sufficient with plenty of choice of drinks.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,I'm convinced beach at Bavaro is one of the nicest in the Caribbean. Iberostar has a large swathe of land on a very nice section of the beach...as a result any Iberostar resort you choose has a nice beach.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Goes on for miles... perfect for long walks at sunset or dawn. There is a reef most of the time so well protected.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,You can spend hours walking the beach It is a great way to get your exercise with out being in the gym. The water is wonderful and lots of resorts to look at as you do your walk.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Clean safe and beautifully maintained. The only drawback is there are no public toilets. They are all private hotels.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Great beach nice and clean water white sand all you need enjoy your holidays. However can get crowded sometimes.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beautiful turquose caribbean water white fine sand great place to relax take some sun and swim. Easy beach stroll to get from one end to another (approx 1.5 miles). In general beach is clean. There where some people selling stuff however they would not be pushy nor bother you.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,beautiful warm water blue skies no jellyfish or trash in the water. no shoes no shirt no problem!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,A definite place to visit. The beach is clean the water is blue and you actually see some fishes swimming. You will a few people selling cigars and thing but they don’t bother you unless you call them over. You will sometimes see a group of children performing and dancing Spanish music which is quite entertaining.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Water was cold very windy at the beach. Nice to lie out on a lounge chair with a drink. Always a server coming around to ask if you need anything.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,We've visited Punta Cana twice now and the beach is gorgeous. Great for long walks. Can be windy at times.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Find the right hotel as even this amazing beach could be overshadowed by a crummy hotel. We have done many beaches in the world and this is one of the best!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Gorgeous weather always reliable kind staff. Don't expect gourmet dining. They try hard and that makes up for than less than stellar food. Could use better entertainment for guests in the evening.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,beautiful palm lined ocean there is always a breeze. the water is gorgeous warm in December and you can walk forever
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beautiful and scenic! Warm water and not too many jellyfish. Ick! First time we stayed there and we will be back.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Soft sand and pretty water that went on forever. Actually no problems with vendors. Great people watching. Did I mention the soft sand and pretty water.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Location is great/ we had fun during our stay/ Have to wake up very early in the morning to reserve your transat on the beach
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,This was a very pleasant and relaxing beach. I could sit and enjoy the sand and sun all day. I am not sure if you could enjoy the beach if you were not staying at the Ifa Villas..
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beautiful beach great sand beatiful blue water and minimal sea grass where I stayed. Gental slope into water.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Amazing white sand and no vendors!! Clear water and not overly crowded. Ocean traffic a little high and can be loud but not constant.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Great sand good beach facilities really warm water (28C) but there are no corals where you can swim to without getting a boat. There are buoys just a few meters along the shore so you can't swim further than 20 meters from the beach.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,clean nice secure beach- lots of diff hotels have their areas but doesnt seem crowded at all! Blue waters lots of water sports to do-
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The sand is so soft. It has a pink tint line the pink sand in Bermuda. The water is clear and has beautiful blue hues to it.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,I have been to beaches all over the world. This has nice sand beautiful water and just the right amount of waves. It is by no means calm like Turks & Caicos. Lot's of fun with kids that like the water and don't mind a little seaweed!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beaches are beautiful kept clean of seaweed warm crystal clear. They are also very crowded so go early and secure your spot! great sand !
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Liked the mix people hotels restaurants. Kind of hard to get away from some of the hawkers but they were not too aggressive.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,As part of our stay we visited this excellent beach to use the Bavaro Splash excursion service (also highly recommend). The beach has a wide variety of watersports and support facilities from lifegaurd stations to toliets from restaurants to shops a real find and genuinely recommend.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Worth the trip it's just a simple day trip but it's nice to get off resort. There are a lot of stray dogs but they seemed to all be friendly - make sure your shots are all up to date!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,the beach was well looked over and groomed every day. the sun was great and strong. My wife looked great and enjoyed the beach in the mornings.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,breakers are out a ways so it's pretty easy to walk local shops at end on a point no vendors approach you walk or run for as far as you can see not great for swimming though.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,not a single second of peace gipsys dont let you they steal you and try to sell time sharing everywhere! 4rd world country
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,One of the world's finest beaches: crystal clear waters silky sand great bathing walking and people watching
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Crystal clear blue. Not too much seaweed issues. Water was so warm. Also not much issues with people bothering you to buy stuff.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,White sand and awesome fun waves it is just a good time i went with my friends and had a blast... Beware of ppl selling you stuff
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,the soft sand and trade winds make this an idea walkable beach. Great people watching and very diverse with travelers from: Brazil Cuba Russia all over Europe and the US!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,White powdery sand clean and serene. Attentive friendly waiters who constantly ask if you want something. Great beach beds under straw jaraguas (umbrellas)
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,We loved everything about this beach!!! We walked the beach every morning after breakfast. No complaints...soft sand clear blue water & nice tradewinds!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Stayed at H10 OBS and enjoyed the beach front there. Some erosion on the privledged side of the beach but the overall condition and access was fine.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Great stay there are massage areas and Sea Pro Divers to take you speed boating and other cool water sports. Go see a guy named LA and he will help you great service.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Only the finest white powdery sand you will ever step on. Great for walking minimal sea weed and no trash on the beach. The best part not too many people. By far equal to or better than the beached in the Myan Riveria.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beaches are beautiful. The sand is like powder they are swept every morning and they are very clean we had chairs waiting for us each morning.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Fine white powdery sand not too many sea weeds which are cleared every morning anyway make this an exceptional beach. have been to many beach holidays but this beach surpasses all of them.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,I was 3 times in Dominican Republic so far and always selected hotels on Bavaro beach. The big plus of the place is that it protected by coral reef so there are no waves on the beach at any time.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beach has a very high 'bounty' feeling so is very enjoyable. But in front of the hotel the swim area is limited in depth so snorkeling isn't very enjoyable. Lots of vendors on the beach ...
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Nice beach but you have to fight with the seaweed for the few feet...once you get mid-waist the water to clear blue-green......lovely and warm
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beautiful people white sands blue sea and a lots of activities to do at the beach! I recommend! :)

g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Loved the soft sand. I can walk on it all day! Temperature of the ocean water was perfect. Water is beautiful! Ocean sounds were so relaxing.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,This beach was perfect perfect sand without rocks or coral and shells under every step. The venders at the point can be a pain but if you stop just short you have experienced all you to without being bothered and don't miss the sunrise or the sunrise swim it's breathtaking...
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The sand was fantastic swimming was really nice. Wave were large at times but never too big. The views at this beach are fantastic with the waves breaking off shore and views of the shipwreck were definitely unique. And the people watching was great too.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,We have been to bavaro many many times and its a wonderful beach sometimes the sea can be a bit rough till you get out a bit never ever wear glasses in the sea every day people lose thier glasses in the sea we come 3weeks twice a year to bavaro x
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,It was a beautiful beach and the water was clear. There are some vendors set up to try and sell things to you but it was a good experience.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beautiful Long stretch of beach. Clean white sand and green waters. Good waves. A bit windy in November. High in the 80's.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,A beautiful beach white powdery sand but waves could be a little stong. Keep tight hold of small children. Ocean does tend to wash the floor out from under your feet. We went in october. Water was lovely and warm.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Nice Beach. Good waves. A bit windy in November. High in the 80's. Clean white sand. Stayed at the Paradisus Resort. What a great place.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,I enjoyed most of the entertainment. Some was a bit too sexual for us. I feel that all need to be entertained. I feel that adult entertainment should be left for later hours. We had to excused ourselves twice. What a bummer! But besides that we had a blast. We would return again!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Out favorite place to be on our trip was at the beach. Gorgeous drinks & towels close clean and lots of chairs to lay out on.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Quiet clean beach. Snorkling arrangements in Palma Real were great! Some days extra seaweed on beach area. Would be nice to remove more often. Security in area helped you to relax. Beautiful.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,It was very peaceful and warm when we have been there .We walked the beach every morning for about 2 hours . Sand very soft with no shells or stones.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,This public beach has beautiful views of the Atlantic fairly gentle surf and sufficient amenities. It's a good place to build a sandcastle or get a tan.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beach is a fair distance and it is beautiful. There are numerous resorts on the beach. You are permitted to walk by the private resorts but not on the resorts. Many resorts have security. The private beaches of the resorts are my preference. On the public parts of the beach you are hassled by vendors.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,we were there at the wrong time because there was a lot of rough waves the hole week we were there but we made the best of it the beach was nice we had a bar by our private beach only for trans sat only a buffet close by good food and beer wine
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Snorkelling is great and you see some lovely fish but after going to Bayahibe a couple of years back I would say the sea is clearer there. If there has been rain the sea is pretty cloudy but do be aware the caribbean and Atlantic meet here so it can be a little rough at times.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beach was cleaned daily the sand was awesome. The water was warm and many colors of blues and greens at times there was seaweed but not much. The waves were strong and beautiful.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beach was very clean and the water warm and clear. The waves are not too big and the view is great.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,the beach is very nice and pretty. there's a little seaweed in certain areas which my husband does not like at all. but the water is warm and blue and the sand is soft. no shells though if you like to collect shells.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,One of the best in the Caribbean! If a storm comes up you might have a lot of seaweed in the water and beach. The resorts try to keep it cleaned up. It is a very clean beach no trash here.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,I rated this average due to the past two years there has been a serious increase in the seaweed. Something has changed in the environment causing this. Locals have no idea why. It is to the point it is more than noticeable and makes it hard to enjoy the water like in years past.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,It is indeed very nice. Visit the pier Snorkel etc. It could use a little better lighting at night though.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,soft powdery sand very clean and perfect waves..lots of palms for shade. You can walk quite far & see several good resorts.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beach in the Bavaro area had to be one of the prettiest beaches I've ever been to in my life. Absolutely gorgeous!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,We arrived at a resort on Bavaro after an east coast blizzard. The sand is soft no rocks no shells very easy walking the miles of gorgeous landscape. The water is lovely shades of blue warm with just enough surf to make getting wet an adventure! Everyday was 82 and sunny..... What more can you ask for.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,the beach was nice but i have to admit the water was a litle wild during my vacations i was still able to swing

g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Bavaro Beach is one of the most beautiful beaches I have ever seen. I have been to this beach for the first time a number of years ago and have returned several times. The sea does produce a fair amount of seaweed but it is swept daily by the hotel staff and produces hardly any inconvenience.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Soft white sand - never burns your feet. Beautiful turquoise water. Nice breezes and wonderful sun.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,This beach was great the water the sand the surf a great experience that is to be remembered for a lifetime. Enjoyed day after day just soaking up the sun cooling off in the water and going for long beach walks.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The sand at bavaro was beautiful my son had a blast playing and we didn't come across one sand flea which is something we were warned about for him. It was cleaned and raked daily by a crew of gentlemen which was unexpected but much appreciated by all beach goers!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beautiful stretch of beach any time of the day or night. Lovely shacks along the way. Beware the sellers. Very persistent!

g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beach and water were beautiful! The only thing I didn't like was how pushy the people down the beach at the market were but you don't have to go into that area.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Best looking beach in Punta Cana! White soft sand and beautiful blue & green water. Clear skies & well manicured palm trees. Paradise on earth for sure!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,no words can explain the beauty of this trip other than it was like I had died & gone to heaven... pretty profound but that;s how the only way I can express myself... trip of my life...
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Gorgeous white powdery sand & Caribbean blue calm water. Always something to do on this beach. Plenty of vendors to choose from and excursions.

g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,This is one of the most beautiful beaches. My only complaint is all the vendors that hasslehassle hassle...I even had one grab my arm and try to pull me back to view him items! Not impressed - If I want to "shop" I will come to you - not the other way around :(

g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beach was clean and warm clear waters. You could see you feed standing deep. What I like the best is that you could go to the beach at any hour of the day. there was always someone patroling the area so you felt safe.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,white sands and clear water and any watersports were contained in cordoned off areas. shaded by natural palm trees so no unsightly parasols hanging around. sunbeds plentiful so need to get up extra early to ensyre one is available.

g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,One of the most beautiful beaches I have ever been to... Warm white sand with palm trees almost all the way to the water's edge beautiful blue water that's the perfect temperature. A bit of sea weed is constantly washing ashore but this does not detract from the beauty of this beach. I would live here if I could!!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,2014 will be our 7th year at the Bavaro Princess. The resort is beautiful - well kept - rooms large and comfortable - restaurants serve excellent food and drink and oh the beach....gorgeous. Found all the employees helpful hard workers and most helpful. Love it!!

g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beach was great lots of entertainment. Resort was a 'zero' very old musty out of date entertainment 'canned' and the food even worse -- food at the beach restaurant was the same old stuff everyday and often ran out. We thought there was a dress code for the sit-down restaurants but saw there was not one!!

g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beach is spectacular! The sand is soft and white! The pictures do not do it justice. The resort was also beautiful. Plenty of chairs to use.

g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,I Like: The weather The beach The sand The hospitality of some locals. I dislike: The vendors of tours at the beach outside the hotels (it´s not safe) The ocean is not quite. Could´nt snorkeling
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,This beach is amazingly beautiful just like you see in the brochures. The water is crystal blue the sand is powder white and Palm trees to top it off. A good walk along the coastline us a must just make sure plenty of water and wear a hat.

g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,A fantastic beach with white powder sand crystal and shallow waters and many many palm trees if you need a shade from the sun. Take a kayak or a catamaran escape the crowds and you will get the real caribbean feel!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Bavaro Beach boasts crystal Clear Teal water incredibly beautiful white beaches & a lovely ocean breeze!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,I enjoyed the beach in bare feet. For an Atlantic beach there were not so many rocks and shells that I needed swim shoes.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,To many vendors on the beach. But that is to be expected as they are after all public. On the upside it was very close to all of the attractions.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Very nice and warm but many sea plants come out to the beach.Very large and you can walk for hours to each direction
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Loved the rye fact that everything was inclusive room accommodates was execellent loved the food and the dinning experience at the Chez Gourmet and coral seafood restaurants. The Bavaro runners excursion was great we were able to see how the people lived horse back riding and much more. Be careful every thing is over price.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,loved the beach here been many times and it's always lovely some straw like weed...but nothing bad depending on were u go on the beach will depend on how clean the section is. some complexes don't clean the beach after use so pleanty of dirt and rubbish about towards end of the days.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beach at Bavaro is truly stunning white sand wherever you look the only negative is the sea which while lovely and turquoise is not crystal clear but still lovely for swimming and relaxing and only a tiny negative given the beauty of the beach.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Love the long flat beach head that goes for miles has a ton of activities on the beach (parasail snorkel swimming beach clubs shopping food and not alot of people)
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beautiful Clean Crystal Clear Beaches!!! Miles and miles of beautiful beach property and plenty of room to enjoy privately.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Relaxed by the beach and got into the water and also sunbath for about three hours I would do it all over again.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,very clean plenty of beds drinks dispensers and a bar on the beach if you want a nice cool drink non alcaholic drink dispensers water orange fruit punch there to help yourself to ideal!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Great beach and the staff are constantly cleaning beach from litter and debris washing up. Small market at one end but aside from this not many vendors trying to hassle you. Super beach:-)
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The colour and feel of the sand is just what you imagine a Caribbean beach to be like it makes those walks in the light breeze memorable.

g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,My wife likes to sit on the beach underneath a palm tree and read a book she is quite content doing that as long as someone comes along every once in a while with a cool libation. I like to walk the beach.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beach was breathtakingly beautiful I was always able to get a sun lounger and there was a lot of waterspouts. This resort caters for everyone.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,very nice beach...to many waves for me though the walk on the beach was nice the sand was so soft as you walked down the beach you could see the pink color in it...vendors at the end annoying but they have to make money somehow i suppose.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Found the beach very clean and white sands waters not so rough the resort needed better service but it has many shops and dining areasmuch to do there.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Great beach great sand but the water is better in true Caribbean locations. The passing locals attempting to get you to purchase items gets a little annoying but they do take no for an answer and will usually pass by if you don't make eye contact!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,We really like how warm the water and how soft the sand was in Punta Cana DR. We enjoyed the beautiful tourquise water and also the Mama juana.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beach is gorgeous!!! The sand is fine and the water is crystal clear. I have never seen such blue water in my life.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,If you love to go to the beach you definitely will love the crystal waters and the white sand below a very hot sun :) The palm trees give the final touch to the scenario.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beach was very crowded in front of the RIU hotels and all the way down the beach. The RIU cleaned up the seaweed in the mornings because there was a lot of it. The wind was strong but manageable. Overall the beach was pretty and sunsets amazing.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Stunning beaches lovely places to swim and eat. Water sports snorkeling and just lazy days. Take in the stunning views of the beaches and busy holidaymakers
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beautiful clean large beach lots of chairsgreat bar servicewith helpful waitresses and waiters.close to the rooms.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,We really enjoyed walking on the white sandy beach with the beautiful palm trees and spent a lot of time with our daughter playing in the soft white sand and building multiple sand castles! Quite a trip to remember.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Personally Juanillio Beach is calmer and less visual pollution i.e.: speed boats banana boats etc.. Too many hotels have their beach there so it's usually quite packed
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,This is the best beach in the Caribbean! The Bavaro Princess sits on the best section of the Bavaro Beach. It is very wide with fine white sand and no rocks or seaweed! The sand stretches way into the water with no coral at all. So that means you can't snorkel off the beach though!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beach for our hotel Luxury Bahia Principe Amber was too crowded. Like Brighton on a warm Bank Holiday.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beach is very taken care of. Very clean. The vendors are a lil annoying but they are hust hussling I don't blame them.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Enjoy the water and sand. There are much to do and security monitors all day and they are cleaning all the time.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beautiful Beach - very clean and talcum powder sand. Good for walking and the sea itself is very clean - loved swimming in it everyday. In fact I swam more in the sea which seemed cleaner than the hotel pools!!!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Get your hair braided! Natives so friendly! This is a nice clean beach and the beach area of the resort is "guarded" at night like many resorts in the world so you're always safe to hang out.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Waves were tremendous as well as super service from all. The entire setting was great! As mentioned earlier- the employees were fantastic (especially Dario Jimenez).
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beach was wonderful. Calm waves and warm water. There seemed to be lots of grass that would wash up to the shore but a few feet in and you didn't notice it.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,This beach was kept spotlessly clean and although busy wasn't too busy to spoil it. There were always plenty of sunbeds and lots of shade.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,gorgeous sandy beach tree lined. Sea crystal clear. Slightly littered with dead trees sea weed further up from iberostar.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beach was beautiful there are a lot of street vendors who are a little persistent when selling their goods
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Its a nice clean beach with sand that feels like brown sugar! The water was beautiful and refreshing...
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,We liked the white sands and the beautiful colors of the water. There are plenty of water sports if you are into that. Plenty of lounge chairs at the beach and the pool area.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The water was very nice not totally clear like in Grand Cayman or other Caribbean places but it was clean and warm the sand was soft and free of any rocks or shells.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beach was gorgeous...very clean. Plenty of chairs and water activities. Great bar! Many water sports to keep you busy.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Very clean! Lots of chairs available. Just walking the beach was great and even found a few seashells!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,You really have a fun time on Bavaro Beach. at Paradisus Punta Cana you have Gabi Beach right there to get drinks at any hour and Naos to get food 24/7
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Great walking/running beach. It goes on and on ..... Beach is patrolled by police but I felt safe and comfortable to walk by myself. Wasn't harassed or felt threatened ever ....
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beach was beautiful. They had people constantly cleaning up the seaweed that would wash a shore.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beautiful beach beautiful water. Good view of the cliff in the distance. We took the "boogie" tour to get there so we couldn't spend a lot of time there.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,This beach is a wonderful beach for walking! We took a a walk at least 2 times each day that we were in the DR. White powdery sand and you can walk forever!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beaches in Punta Cana are beautiful. Island Of Paradise. The local people want to sell you anything.So stay on the beach. Drinks are great plenty of Rum and Presidente'.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,If you wanna see a beach like you do in pictures in magazines go to this beach. The locals did ask you to buy their stuff but when you tell them no thank you they walk away.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,If you like clear water and beautiful soft sandy beaches then this beach is the one for you don't miss it when you travel to the Dominican it was one of our favourite places.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Very good hotel but everybody smokes as hell. Food is acceptable and the golf course is nice. Bavaro De Lux is vegas style
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,the most aqua blue waters I have ever seen. Salty waters well groomed beaches the native people work really hard to maintain the beaches for our pleassure. Make sure you buy work gloves to pass them out to the workers I did and it was greatly appreciated.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Very beautiful beach with fine white sands. Plenty of chairs and shade. Great fun in the sea.... not good for snorkelling though. Don't forget to visit the outdoor market... great fun!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,This beach was very nice with pink fine sand. The water was warm and aqua blue. There did seem to be a lot of sea grass floating in the water at the time we went but it didn't bother us while swimming.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,White Sandy beach with people bringing you drinks its awesome! What more could you ask for. And the beach beds & cabanas were a nice feature.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beautiful white sand great to swim clean water like the picture! Lots of palm treas for a shade on it :)
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,This is a gorgeous clean beach the water is crystal clear and there are plenty of seats chairs and there is a food and beverage bar on the beach if you are in one of the resorts. Loved it.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Clear waters white sand what's not to like? This is a safe place to kick back what a slice of beauty. So lucky to be here.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Gorgeous crystal clear clean beach. We were not harassed on the beach while on our resort but if you venture down to the shops in the huts near the Iberostar Grand - get ready to haggle!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Was just ok for a little bit more money much better hotels available Do your homework it's well worth it try bluebaytravel travel They have a lot of good pricing
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beach was absolutely gorgeous. White sand- clear water. Temp perfect! Plenty of chairs for everyone and then some!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Felt safe and water was nice and warm. water sports were nice and kids loved it. My buddy heredia made us feel safe and was very pleasant to chat with
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,It is hard to get to but the breezy air and palm trees on the beach make it a beautiful place to hang out.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Note  lots of seaweed. Not fun. Not necessarily hotels fault. Nature plays a part in this. Most of beach was clean though.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,This is a beautiful clean beach. If you are staying at a resort you are not pestered by locals to buy stuff.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Stunning beach some seaweed but they clean it daily! Worth staying for sunset and water is calm to swim in.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,beautiful always sun beds available sea clear not hassled to much by sellers joined in with some beach games.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,There are great areas for swimming in front and near the hotel. Walk on the beach from end to end so you can see for yourself. You'll notice that there's a lot more seaweed in certain sections of the beach.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Loved the Pure white Sandy beaches as seen in postcards. Would recommend walking along the beach. Therapeutic.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beach is nice behind the resort but if you walk off to either side you will be approached by salespeople....
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,warm crystal clear water! not bombarded with people breath taking they cater to us at the beach and you can shop there and barter with the sales people you can para sail relaxing you will enjoy
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Crystal clear water slow to medium waves tilapia viewing plenty of activities on shore and not to mention awesome food on the beach from Melia Caribe and other resorts alike !!! I wish I have time to come back here . Two thumbs up !
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,So beautiful beach water clear and sand beautiful and water quiet also. You may swim in a quiet water also you can see all fishes around it.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,You cannot ask for more. It is really "a paradise". Everything is so perfect. I don't want to come back home!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Clean sandy smooth barefoot-friendly but watch out for rip tides in the afternoons. No shells beautiful people fun to watch activities on and off-shore. What can I say - go and see for yourself it's a good place to chill.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,My husband and I stayed for 5 days in an all inclusive resort. Every day the beach was perfect azure crystalline warm water white fine sand and nice shade under the palms to relax. There are plenty of beach sports in all the resorts. We cannot wait to go back!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beach is Beautiful. We loved it!!! We would definatly go back there again. Its one of the top 10 Beaches to go and see.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,White sand swimmable beach turquoise water. Every day my sisters and I took long walks to catch up on news and gossip and people watch. Just gorgeous.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The sand was really white the water was blue and clear . Lots of activities to do on the beach. We had several great days in the water and doing water activities .
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Clear water white sand and wonderful body surfing waves. Private beach. Great bar service from the hotel staff
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Always a breeze to cool off a bit. Snorkeling is so close it's amazing what is literally just yards away!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Lot of activity in a relatively small area. Between the resort provided activities and the vendors there is a lot of traffic.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beautiful Beaches friendly staff  kid friendly hotels wish our hotel had more things for teenagers to do but over all great vacation.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Easy access amenities all around. Very helpful service. The sand was beautiful clean really white and soft. Palm trees hammocks nice warm water. Water sports right there from Banana Boats to Para Sailing to power boats to snorkeling trips.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The water is the most gorgeous shade of aqua blue. It is crystal clear. The sand is soft and white. A more beautiful beach - I have not seen. Paradise
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Bavaro Beach is one of the best beaches in the caribbean. The water is a clear blue and warm. I heard Bavaro Beach is the best in DR. The only dislike I have is the seaweed but it was not a big deal.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,A good mix of options available trip wise. Kept clean & safe with some good waves & lovely turquoise colour even though it was the Atlantic. Loved it especially sunrise
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,the beach is very beautiful and very pretty white powdered sand -the seaweed a bit of an eyesore staff were cleaning it constantly!!!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,It was post card picture perfect the beach that you dream about. Bavaro beach was beautiful and the sea was very clear and warm too
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,This is a beautiful white sand beach with lots of big and tall palm trees. The sea is nice and warm but sometimes due to weather sea weeded.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,I like riding the catamaran sail boat which can accommodate four average size people. Sometimes too windy and rough water noticed during our stay. Frequent raining during night time. An early morning walk on the beach is good.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,I love the beach so so clean. The only problem you have to go very early to get a good spat and chair.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beach was Beautiful. just lots of seaweed. The water was calm and very warm. No problem getting chairs plenty available
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beautiful Beach however the seating was limited and the bar service was kind of slow as the waitstaff that works the beach also works the pool area.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Trip was great. Crew and staff very helpful and professional. Had a chance to swim snorkle and have a few adult beverages. Best part of my trip to Punta Cana
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,White Caribbean sand and plenty of palm trees to give you some shade and get away from the sun! However there is a lot of seaweed floating in the water which attract little fish and sometimes you tend to step into them if you're not careful but the water is calm and temperature wise very cool.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beautfiul beach I just found the ocean was a bit rough. There was allot of waves!! Water pushed me out a couple of times!! You need to be aware when you are in the water that`s for sure!!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,nothing to dislike - secure clean - can walk for miles - lots to do or not. people perfect and lots of room.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,This beach was paradise looked like a beautiful picture. Our safari excursion took us. And i must say it was amazing. The water is so clear i can see right through it..Not much waves which is also perfect. WE loved it and deff will visit again soon.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Snorkelling! Scuba diving and speed boats! Organization of the excursion was great! Good safety explanation and Eric was especially helpful.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beach water was nice and warm I would say probably in the 70's. the thing I disliked was that people don't care and there are cigarette butts in the sand. The community or property owners need to create a policy not to smoke to avoid these types of pollutants in the beach.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,loved it the sun is great and the sand is so clean the waves could be a bit strong overall I love it very much
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Warmth of the sun clear watersand the texture of sugar.Very good for walking and swimming. Not crowded but many happy faces.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,It was beautiful and perfect prescription to any tensions and blues one may bring from Home.Don't like all the seaweed along the waterline. However in all fairness the authorities make a real concerted effort to get it off as quickly as possible
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,This beach is lovely and you can walk for miles both ways the Warter is nice to swim in or just to relax on the beach one of the best in the world
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,cleaning staff pleasant lovely gardens constant hassle of dodging sellerssome "couldn't be bothered staff".
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,White Sand Aqua clear Water Hardly any seaweed or garbage on the beach. Parasailing and Banana Boat options available to you and it's only steps away from the dining room/barbecue so your literally eating right by the beach
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,We enjoyed Bavaro beach the white sand and the warm water My only gripe is the Helicopters that fly over the beach all day long
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,I was here a few years back and I can't find anything negative about the resort. My wife and I met a lot of very nice people. I will come back to this resort and I highly recommend it.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Food drinks rooms were awesome !!!! Service was Excelente. Ask for Angel he was amazing and toom such great care of us.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Please dont miss out on visiting The Beach Club in Bavaro. It was our favorite part of our trip. Ask for Alex or Franklin. You MUST get his mamajuana and seafood parrillada. UNBELIEVABLE!!!!!!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,clean and lot of activities royal service at paradisus palma real was great very comfortable lounge chairs with cover & towels.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,I preferred Cap Cana Beach more secluded and away from the town. We prefer a more peaceful tranquil experience and not a loud and annoying experience with the the town people.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Their was nothing  not to like about this Resort Everything was amazing I would recommend this resort to anyone Our Travel Agent Chamica Vanvield from Flight Center did a super job arranging our trip to Punta Cana and staying at the Hard Rock Resort
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,love life living and doing your thing with a doubt the vibes will leave you wanting for more wow its off the hook hot up in here .universal rav one baby
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Always tidy roped off area to keep water craft away from bathers. Snorkel a must to watch the fish in the rocky outcrops just off the beach.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beach had beautiful white soft sand and cool blue water. It was comfortable and relaxing. The beach was one of our favorite parts of the trip!

g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,calm clear waters--flat surface nice breeze and good shade trees can walk a long way out-and still be chest high-5 feet out
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Could go out over a 100 yards and never be over chest deep. Nice and calm. Beautiful beach. Recommend visiting
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Loved the beach. Nothing to dislike about it. A lot of activities to do. Sailing snorkeling kayak included.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Early morning daily walk 2-3 hours daily! Fabulous! Not too many folks about early morning beautiful beach some sections a bit weedy but overall a beautiful walk.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Absolutely beautiful!!! Very relaxing and quiet!! Definitely a trip to take again!!! Well worth the money!!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beach was clean and had plenty of space. The water was a little to rough for my liking. Waves were not to big but were constant and made it difficult to wade with a young child.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Powdery sand tropical waters. Nice even flow from the beaches. Have heard of seaweed issues but there was none the week of our visit. Constant cooling breezes.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Bavaro beach at our resort Be Live PuntaCana Cana was okay. Not as clean as the beaches past it are. The further up past our resort they have nicer beaches the further in-land you went. But it was bearable.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beautiful safe sandy beach. Mostly full of all inclusive hotel guests  but can find few places for nice sunbathing
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,beautiful beach with nice water and clean sand you dont get bothered too much by vendors and some of the little restaurants on the beach are good
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,This is a beach that the water is placid and good to swim in if you also have little tots running around. You won't want to leave the water it's so nice and warm. The hotel resorts along the beach are so beautiful as well. Nice beach walk.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,a great beach no complaints at all.get there early cause all the best spots are taken early. the waves are really good in the afternoon
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Shades of turquoise warm water palm trees perfect white sand comfortrable beach chairs only the shortest of walks from our room.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,This beach is fabulous. This is the only ocean that I was not afraid to swim in. They have parasailing and windsurfing but the beach does not offer jet skiing I guess because sometimes the waves can get a little high
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Was a lot of fun. Really enjoy the trip. The weather was fantastic as well as the staff. People here in Santo domingo are very warn and hospitality is great. Thank you very much.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,clear water plenty of activities. always found a great spot with chairs and towels. close to the pool and snack bar...just steps away!

g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beach wasn't clean at all. Trash was everywhere. Staff members do not maintain the beach at all.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,paradise right outside the hotel golden sands and turquoise sea amazing walk for miles in both directions and your surrounded by palm trees which help with the shade and the sea breeze
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,clear water nice entertainment food was pretty good for a day at the beach the catamaran coming back was the best part for us and most important VERY RELAX!!!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Bavaro Beach is a great area to visit. It is not fully built out yet like Cancun so the Beaches are not over crowded. It is Beautiful white sand and great resorts defiantly worth a look.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,There are many tourist on the beach by mid morning and frankly I prefer a beach that's secluded. Early morning was the time to come to the beach for solitude.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,White sand turquoise waters. Cleanclean. Not crowded at all. Can take long walks and feel safe. You can do Parasailing Scuba Diving.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,This is the beach in front of the Iberostar Grand Hotel. White sands beautiful turquoise colored water long beach to walk and relax. It had a yellow flag when I was there (windy some currents) but despite it you could swim without having a high surf. There were many small "shacks" to cover from the sun.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Warm turquoise waters and smooth sandy shores make this one of the best beaches on the Atlantic Ocean.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beautiful beach perfect sand...if you visit this place you have to stay at the Majestic Colonial! This place is absolutely amazing
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Lovely beach beautiful views you can walk out 1000 metres and be safe and in depth. WOW Staff really friendly great for kids to swim in no rough tides like dreams punta cana
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,the cleanest most beautiful beach ever the sand is so white and the water so blue You can walk for miles and see some of the most wonderful sights
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,This beach is pretty beautiful clear water and sand. Just a few vendors and the waves are small which is good for relaxing. As I could see almost all its extension is front of the resorts
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,there was no parking street was crowded and access to the beach was very limited. It was a very unpleasant trip. highly overrated
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Sun and sand are great the waters of the punta cana are worth the trip. It makes up for the non smiling people.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Great beach with very calm water. There is lots of beach activities like snorkeling sailing boating etcetera .
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,What isn't there to like about miles of white palm tree lined sandy beach? This has got to be the most stunning beach we have ever been to.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Clean no trash. Lots of sports water events to join into. Animation team has beach challenges daily which are fun.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Clean. Water beautiful and warm. Little bit of seaweed but cleaned daily. Stayed at the Paradisus pinta Cana situated on Playa de Bavaro. Beautiful location. Walked the length of the beach and Paradisus has the best beach area by far best lounging seating bar area etc.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beach at Bahia Prinicipe is amazing. Beautiful sandy beaches that stretch for a long distance. Lots of shade for those who want a break from the hot sun.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,We thoroughly enjoyed our time on Bavaro Beach...the sand was like white powder water was calm and super warm snorkelling off the beach. There are some vendors but a firm ( but friendly) no gets your point across. Gorgeous beach!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,We spent at least 2 hours a day walking on the beach. Soft sand and lots to see. We would stop at various bars to have some refreshment. Just remember you will have to walk back so time yourself.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Sand dirty with paper cups etc. Vendors interrupting your rest time every 5 to 10 min trying to sell you entertainment packages. You say no to one the next one comes over you blocking your sun.. Its just total harassment.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The sand was like powder. They dragged the beach everyday. It was gorgeous. The water was warm and amazing.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Great water - calm enough to enjoy daily. Cool breeze helps with the heat. Snorkeling among the coral shows some sea life.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Way to many vendors that want to sell you things way over priced on the beach....buyer beware......be ready to barter.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,the water was warm and clean and so relaxing. i only go in the water when i go on vacation. they have the best beaches. don't have that at home.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Great staff clean and very relaxing..no complaints about this trip..loved everything...Great drinks not watered down!!!!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Enough seating all the time for everyone and very clean. The seating is very comfortable too. Never felt crowded.

g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beautiful white sand beach. Crystal clear waters! Would recommend for everyone to see. Rent a kayak and see the beach from the water!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,clean soft sand beautiful blue water amazing palm trees to give you shade if you want if not you can sunbathe. bars on the beach ready to quench your thirst or to socialize with local travelers. fresh coconuts to sip on and beautiful loungers to relax in

g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beautiful white sand palm trees scattered for shade. Lovely landscape with pretty shades of blue/green water.

g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Great scenery well kept and enjoyed our stay their for the day. Recommend you check it out great place.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Perfect beach for snorkeling as theirs no waves and it was clean and clear. We walked along the beach both directions every day and enjoyed picking up small shells for necklaces!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beach is very well maintained and very secure. Constantly being patrolled by police officers to make sure that the tourists are safe.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Tons of seaweed on the shore n water is dirty! Many natives walk through to solicit for braids massages & souvenirs. It is very annoying!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,We had such an excellent time with the family as we attended the beach the pool the restaurants we did sightseeing and all staff was wonderful. I must say you must attend the Melia for its Spiritual wonders.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,My entire family enjoyed the trip. We will be coming back 2014. The beach is beautiful with so many pools. There were so many restaurants to choose from and the food was so delicious. The suites are large and beautiful; wonderful ocean view. We like everything about this place..
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Loved walking this beautiful white sand beach every day. Amazing that under that hot sun the sand was never too hot for walking!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beautiful beach! We spent a lot of time in the ocean and had a blast playing in the waves. Plenty of chairs were available and the beach was very clean.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Lots of white sand some seaweed but not too bad. It is cleaned up but it's there it won't hurt you. Sand does not burn your feet like some places very soft and fine.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,One of the best beaches I have ever seen in my life. The white sand and the clear and absolutely stunning water.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,the beach is simply amazing definitely take a walk after breakfast so you can enjoy the scenery before everyone is out and about on the beach ;)
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Bavaro is NOT Punta Cana as so many businesses and hotel may want you to believe. But it is beautiful.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Wonderful beach!!! Be sure to try the special banana drink by the beach. The bartender is great- looks like Obama when he smiles!!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,I was most impressed with how clean the beach was. Even during the downgraded storm during our visit (Tropical Storm Chantrel) to see staff members out there picking up seaweed and raking the dirt back into shape was impressive. They really take care in keeping this place spotless!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,White sands clear waters canoed and swam. Starfish and small shoals of fish Sometimes diesel smell from boats..
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,This was the only good part of our vacation. The rooms were gross food was disgusting and staff were very rude.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,We loved the hotel the landscape is so beautiful and well taken care of. The service was superb everyone is making feel welcome especially Jose at the coffe corner illy Reinaldo C at the sky bar  Edison at the Pilates . Really great.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,We have been to Cancun several times and to Paradise Island once. This was one of the best in the Caribbean. The water was clear and warm while the sand was really soft.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The ocean is a beautiful soft blue color & waves mostly gentle. There were rocks in the water where we stayed but we just tried to stay clear of them--no biggie. Nice soft sand and wonderful clean water with perfect temperature to enjoy!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Lovely beach - lots of sunbeds and umbrellas however lots of different watersports happening at the same time and they constantly encroach into the designated swimming area - their water safety standards are not like ours saw lots of near misses - please be careful peeps!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beautiful beach! Great to walk across all the way to the point. The vendors on the beach are a little aggressive though. Found a live seahorse in the water!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Barely a rock in sight! The beach is as soft as talcum powder and the water is the perfect temperature.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,I loved the huts you could sit under and feel the breeze but not be exposed to too much sun and you could still watch the parasailing and other activities. The other neighboring resorts didn't have those.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beach was the only good thing about this resort. Service was the worst that I have ever experienced and the language barriar was profound.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The activities they played were entertaining to watch and play. The ocean was perfect. No waves clean warm.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,I loved this resort. The service was excellent food was delicious and the rooms comfortable and clean.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,There is nothing to not like. Palm trees calm blue water. There a huts set up along sections of the beach selling souvenirs local crafts cigars etc. The vendors are a bit aggresive but nice enough. We did buy a few things there but had to bargain them way down - they were asking outrageous prices.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,We noticed that areas of the beach were constantly been cleaned by staff at hotels mostly sea grass the Ocean seemed very clean. International clientele be prepared to see topless.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,what an experience we had a great time and we loved the beaches they were very clear wheather was wonderful
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beach was "average". If you are choosing to go to a fabulous pristine beach I would say during the month of June would not be the right time. Alot of seaweed along the shore line as well as growing in the water.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Amazing perfect beaches at Majestic Elegance on Bavaro Beach! I can't wait to go back! My husband had a great time tubing on the banana boat!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Nice sand. Clear warm water. Clean. We walked for miles most days we were there. The only bother were the merchants but they are only trying to make a living.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,WE did 2 snorkel trips that were out of Bavaro Beach. Both trips were great. The deep sea fishing trip was horrible. NO fish and sick. Don't do it!!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beach is clean. A lot of water activities you can choose from including parasailing. A bit noisy from next door resort.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Everything was amazing the sand was white the water was crystal clear. Have no doubt I would come back!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Amazing beach  sea was clear and very relaxing we found a star fish when we went snorkelling on the reefs.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Soft white sand for miles-great for walking along the surf line-crowded-beach games noisy music -lovely warm water
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,gorgeous clean beach. gorgeous white sand. there is a bit of seaweed in the ocean but its not a problem. The waves were rough at the time we went but it remained a yellow flag
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beaches were great  staff at the majestic ellegance was first class. Rooms were clean grounds kept immaculant all in all found this resort to be a must stay!

g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Most beatifull domincan beach :) i spend there over one week and I will back there . Many places  restaurants on the beach are privat. Og to the Jelly Fish  buy some drinks and you can relax there all day for free ..
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,LOVE the sand no need for shoes clear blue water safe to walk activities available to purchase such as kayaks parasailing banana boat rides and tube rides. Fantastic breeze in JUNE
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Motorised activities to close to shore with noisy speedboats and gliders. Nauseating petrol smell wafting each time a boat passes by which is quite frequently.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,What I liked the most is in the way you are treated and the great food how clean and the restaurants are great specialiy the Comedie (French Restaurant)
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Love the Beach and Scenery and the people. Great little stores right on the beach. Great local dining opportunities.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The ocean was clear and a beautiful aqua color. The beach is cleared every morning of items washed on shore.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,You really can't beat this beach. I think it's the best I have ever seen. Weather is usually great there as well.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Very pretty beach well kept. Lots of people walking up and down all day so great people watching!!!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,After being to other destinations we found that the most beautifull beach is the Bavaro for the distance you can walk and it is very well maintained at all times We have been there for 23 times since 2011
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Amazing beach! If you are looking for somewhere to go with beautiful beaches this is definitely the place to go.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,One of the most stunning beaches you will ever step your feet in the water is blue as blue and the sand white as white. You will not be disappointed.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beautiful white powder sand beaches! Fun trip to Don Lucas Cigar Factory! Great stay at Barceló Bavaro Beach Adults Only! all great!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Amazing beach white sand and turquoise water. Highly recommend to visit! Beware of waves but most hotels have swimming pools anyway.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Bavaro beach is miles of soft white sand. At times its rough and at times not so much. There is seaweed but noticed the riu resorts cleaning it up on a daily basis. Would definitely recommend going as you will enjoy the beach.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,this beach is absolutely beautiful! definitely in my top 3 list. The seaweed is only there when it has rained/stormed (from my experience). But otherwise water is crystal clear warm and calm.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,the beach is stunning and plenty of sea breeze. There are a plenty of water actives on the beach e.g boat trips paragliding paddle boats also good for the children as they can build sandcastles
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Simply put half my stay I enjoyed the sunrise at the beach and all I can say is What a view! Amazing nothing less than spectacular being mesmerized by the display of colors of a sunrise in this beautiful Dominican Beach!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beach was good with chairs and cabanas plentiful. Water not perfect but OK. Close to Market Grill Naos and Gabi Beach restaurants along with pool bar so easy living.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,bavaro beach is nice but can be a little rocky in some places and seaweed in the sea  not the best beach in the world but still nice and as a breeze which you need punta cana it is very very hot
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beach is beautiful with white sand and a gorgeous blue ocean! Windy which causes a few waves but definately cools you down with the bright hot sun.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Like: Beach pools rooms "el Pescador restaurant"kid's Club and the majority of the hotels staff customer service. Dislike: Buffet and restaurant's food drinks offered and the lobby managers.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Like: Very clean soft sand and warm ocean. Dislike: Too far a walk to the beach shops and they won't let you tour other resorts.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beach was a most beautiful pristine beach and very very clean. Warm Blue ocean water was also very clean. No seaweed or rocks.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,I liked the soft white sand and clear water. Did not like just how busy it was and also the petrol smell from the boats and the parasailing. Too many vendors as well.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,just perfect..all arround clean  blue  some waves  want to go back asap.. there are still many locations to invest in on this beach
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Smooth beach no rocks/coral to step on roped off waters to prevent you from stepping on the rocks large fish to see right at the shore for snorkeling chairs galore smooth waters & beautiful views.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,These were some of the prettiest beaches we ever saw. Beautiful white sand. The hotel area of the beach was well maintained. Loved it.

g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,35kms of powdery unobstructed sand. The water was very rough and wavy and did not have nice clarity. Nicer beaches in Cuba and Turks and Caicos.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,majestic colonial was amainsing i thanks the chef at the restaurant las caravela jorje nunez ramon morales rafael ruiz cueva and all the staef they war wonderful

g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beach is clean with washed up seaweed however this is removed every day. The water is warm and safe for children as you would have to swim far out for deeper water.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beautiful blue waters with plenty of beach activities...boat rentals windsurfing party cruises. Water was warm and the weather was incredible. We'll be back soon.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beautiful clean and fun waves to swim in. Stick to the resort areas to avoid venders. We bought an inner tube and my son spent house floating over the waves. Fish in the water close to the beach.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Great beach but People are topless everywhere I don't like that myself. I think people should have more respect for others that don't want to see it!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,A lovely quiet calm beach. Sea a little choppy so inflatable things are hard work out there! Beach sellers walk along just say no and they leave you alone.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,white sand perfect green warm water nothing to complaint about a lil erosion but the rest is perfect
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beach was beautiful and clean. Great breeze. My husband and I took nice long walk during the day and enjoyed drinks at night undisturbed.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,beach was very clean but unable to swim in ocean because very rough Please see review for Cheap Caribbean and the Riu Palace Bavarro Hotel
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The sea is lovely and warm and the sand is very well kept. Seaweed is cleaned up and I am very impressed with all the effort from the staff.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,A fantasticbeach the waters beautiful clean and safe to swim in. You can walk for miles the beach vendors are a bit of a pain but you get that everywhere Just be firmly polite and say no thanks. One of the best beaches i have been to and i travel a lot.

g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Miles and miles of beautiful white sandy beach. The water is warm and shallow; and an offshore reef keeps the water relatively calm for swimming.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beach is huge and the palm trees are beautiful. It is the Atlantic side so the water isn't as blue.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beautiful sand and blue water. Just great for laying out or swimming or any of the other many activities available.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Some resorts areas are better than others in keeping their areas clean. The Reserve at Paradisus Punta Cana did a nice job with theirs beachfront.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Best beautiful soft white sand beaches I've ever seen !!! A must see! Easy to get to  great beach side service  friendly staff everywhere  warm clear waters :)
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Fabulous beach - really what you imagine Paradise to be. Nothing at all to dislike the sand is white the sea a beautiful shade of blue and a gentle breeze to cool you!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,BEACH not azure somewhat rocky harder tug than other places at Higuey. Pool and swim up bar were outstanding. Truly.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The turquoise water is amazing the palm trees on the beach are beautiful and the sand feels like silk.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Lovely clean always sun beds and the sea was almost rock and seaweed free. Lots of fish could be seen in clear clean water. No rubbish or dog ends spent days under the umbrellas or in the sea
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,White sandy beach very clean constant patrol of guards by land and air felt extremely safe. Warm clean water and not too many water sports going on around you. Amazing and definitely recommend it!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,They have the palm trees in which you can take the loungers and relax underneath with a drink and relax.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Nice wide beach beautiful sand warm water The water gets deep quite quickly so not kids friendly but there is good snorkeling just of the beach.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,the beach was awesome food not so great no alcohol in drinksGot married there & it was the worst experience I had
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,We love everything in the Dominican Republic most of the people are so friendly. There are lots of trips for the people visiting for the first time. We have been to both parts of the island Porta Plata and Punta Cana but prefer Punta Cana. The island as developed so much since our first visit .
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,We enjoy every minut of the stay beaches are great as well as the service and the people that work there. Only one thing is kind of dense the vendors of different attactions or trips pictures etc. it's hard to get rear of them in general.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,People were too pushy but understandable to due the fact if you don't sell you don't eat. Life is harder in other countries. I did like not being on other people's schedules....I mainly went there to replay and be on my own schedule.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The different colors of the ocean.... Very very clean and no matter how hot it gets the white sand stays cool..........
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,WOW!!! Most beautiful clean beach I have ever seen! Water was warm and crystal clear. Sand was so soft and clean.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Clean never crowded absolutely safe relaxed ideal for a morning walk. Would not mind smaller waves :)
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,there was nothing to dislike. the water was so clean. I do recommend getting water socks if you are going to be in the ocean
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The water was absolutely amazing. The beach was super clean. The waitresses come up to you all day long to refill your drinks. Beautiful people and atmosphere. Besides the workers who try to sell you hand made jewelry. Nice place to walk around during sunrise or sunset with the wife. Very picturesque.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Very clean beach and beautiful palm trees - so able to sit partially shaded if desired. Would recommend !
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Clean wide open and very nice view and clear water. Located in a great place. Lifegaurd is on site from 8am til 5pm which is a plus.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,There are a few poachers out on the beach wanting you to buy their items or sign up for excursions they're used to rejection so don't feel too shy about saying no.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,What a beautiful beach. The waters are calm comparable to the East Coast seasides. But are not flat like bays etc... The water was crystal clear and the sand super soft and just wonderful no rocks shells or any other irritants.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,WOW everything was wonderful from the service to the food to the activites...wish we stayed there again this time!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Crystal clear waters powdery white sand exceptionally clean extraordinarily gorgeous. What's not to love?
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beach was pretty the water was calm pretty sea shells. Very clean. The vendors were very nice and friendly.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Did not like the "hustlers" on the beach constantly trying to sell you something. Loved the shade options on the beach.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,We really enjoyed the beach especially around the Majestic Elegance not to many vendors bothering you. We have stayed in other areas and they can be quite agressive especially around the NH Real
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The water was turquoise the sand was white and the beach was beautiful. We stayed at the Majestic Colonial Resort. We watched beautiful weddings every day on the beach. It was absolutely beautiful!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Most amazing beach I've ever been too. Sand was so white and picturesque. The water was so clear and the perfect temperature.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,beach was lovely white sand. very clean. beach vendors do not bother you unless you showed interest.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,No stones to hurt your bare feet. No rubbish lying around. Very little seaweed. Easy to swim in. No sales people on he beach pestering you.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The Bavaro beach was great. When we got tired of the beach we went up to the pools with the swin up bar. It was really fun.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Management should pickup unattend towels left by people at pool side. Huge problem with people saving chairs at pool side by leaving their towels on it all day long.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The whole experience was horrible. I would never go back even if you paid me. Punta Cana is definetly not a place to have a wedding!!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Enjoyed the views. The only thing was the seaweed that came a shore. It was cleaned up daily. Watching the set and come up daily was beautiful.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,the beach was pretty the sand was soft the water was clear and the waves weren't to powerful! easy to swim in and play!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Not the best ever but not bad either. Bavaro beach is easy to walk and the sand is beautiful. Lots of seaweed is a constant struggle to keep the beach clean but it is what it is. It's only seaweed.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beautiful white sands and blue sky. The water is lovely and warm. But it's not much for snorkeling. There are many water sports being sold to tourists if you want parasailing short boat trips pirate party boats and the like. No jet skis.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Everything. Would recommend this resort to anyone. Beautiful rooms. clean nice beach just a great location and enjoyed the adult only.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,So beautiful -- 9/10 for cleanliness as well. Watch out for pushy sales people in certain areas and stay near the water when walking through "private" beach front resorts.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beach was clean and the water was warm. The only thing that I did not like is people were no very considerate when it came to space.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The seaweed crept onto the beach often but the staff was very diligent about raking it to keep it off the beach
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Clean waters & less weeds. Good beach to take a dip & relax without waves.South side of the beach has more weeds around catalonia.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beautiful scenary and awesome marina! Very cool excursions that leave throughout the day and a ton of them to chose from. Reef Explorer was great and they have a ton of party boats as well. Such a cool and beautiful place!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,the rooms are old and small. The towles do not change everyday. food is simple and plain. A/C unit is very noise. The pictures on Ad are different from the real one.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,white sand turquise waters little or no debris on beach plenty of beds available on Ambar section. You can walk in both directions on beach
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,I was in Punta Cana and Bavaro Beach is so beautiful with the white soft sand and dark blue and green water. It's a calm beach and great for swimming.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Very nice clean beach. Real beach not man-made. Lots of spots to sit in a chair and relax with a daiquiri or two
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Water was rough so it was hard to swim in. It was somewhat seaweedy. Because of this I didn't spend too much time in it. Just went in to get wet and cool off. It looked beautiful though. So because of that I rated it "very good".
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,There was alot of seagrass off shore during our visit but the hotels are very fast at cleaning this off the beaches. Sand is wonderful but did niot see any seashells due to the break off shore.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Bavaro beach is beautiful with clean white sand. The water is warm and has no waves because it's protected by a coral reef. Very relaxing and feels like a lagoon.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beach is wonderful with soft white sands and blue seas. It is extremely long and you can walk the whole length of the beach
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Very salty clear beautiful waters and beach. Nothing to complain about. Bring lots of sunscreen and don't go mid-late afternoon or you'll lose the sun and get rained on. No guest services available on the beach but the bar was close by.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beach is soft white sand. You can walk and walk along the beach past all the hotels. The water is enjoyable and we've found it warm enough to walk right into every time we've been there.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,if you go on vacation to punta cana try to stay in a Resort on the Bavaro Beach area....we love that area it`s clean..the water has waves and the Resorts are very close to visite...nice to walk for miles
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,There are plenty of places to lay back and relax to enjoy the view if you want or you can go swimming in the ocean and be one with nature!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The water is refreshing you can see your feet no shells no rocks Only one little wave then it is smooth sailing. I did not like to see that all the chairs and umbrellas were saved with towels lucky we met a nice couple from England fhey shared the umbrella with us. Hn
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Very busy no quiet spots here people constantly walking it we walked early morning before the hoards. Is a lovely breeze and walk great on the feet.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,This beach is unbelievable. The sand is like fine sugar the water clear and warm with just a little bit of surf. Great for walks swims and building sand castles and watching the moon set and the sun rise!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,One of the best beaches we have ever stayed on. You can walk for miles in comfort. Water was a beautiful color and there was always a nice breeze.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Spent 8 Glorious days in the sun on those white sandy beaches. Water was fantastic! Ocean felt nice and warm. I'd gladly go back to that beach for the next lounge vacation.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The sand is nice to sink your toes into and the water is calm and beautiful. As you walk off the resort property be prepared to have all kinds of vendors hassle you.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,All I can say is you will not be disappointed. Lots of lifeguards. Lots of security. If it rains it is such a fast warm rain you will still enjoy yourself.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Water was beautiful pristine sand throughout and relaxing cabanas aplenty. Easy access and very short distance from the room. Beverage service was continually available and staff was top notch.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Warm water clean sandy beaches. Lots of palm trees. Just like I want my beaches. Lots of lifeguards around. Vendors aren't too bad. They keep walking by but are friendly enough when you say you don't need anything.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,One of the most beautiful beaches I have ever seen! The water is very blue and the sand is clean. A very nice place to sit and relax with a nice breeze.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beautiful beach with soft clean sand. Great sunrise to see. The water is very clean and most of the time the waves are gentle. We have always seen fish too.... Enjoy Bavaro beach
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,It is very clean long soft and nice to walk. We stayed in Iberostar Bavaro and walked in both directions and never got to the end of it
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Dislike = no seashells. Like = warm waves that made it easy to relax and just melt into the water. When in water up to your neck you can still see clearly to your toes!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beautiful crystal clear water & soft white powdery sand. You can snorkel wherever you see coral while walking down the beach.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,We ended our Bavaro Runners tour at this beach. It was just beautiful the water was quite warm and just the right amount of waves.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,the beach goes on forever. we walked every day for 4-6 miles on the beach. It kept us in shape after enjoying the restaurant meals
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beautiful ocean water lots of things to do at the beach; sailing snorkeling kayaking volleyball beach games organized by the staff pool bars with staffed activities drink demonstrations on the beach weddings to watch on the beach every day...
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Liked that the beach water is clear and beautiful as always sand and sun was the best Disliked that there a sort of cliff when we came onto the beach; we went to another area and had direct view and access to the beach
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Having grown up on Lake Michigan (still my Number 1 beach!) I would say this beach is certainly in the top ten and possibly top five beaches I have ever been on.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Awesome beach! White sand place! Be ware of the sun...very very hot! The water is clean depending on what part of the beach you are on. Only thing i hated about it was that the beach was very very dirty! broken glass garbage people there are very dirty.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,No sun beds available. Beach parking area very untidy. Good for body boarding as lots of surf. Not so good for small children.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Actually Cayena beach was really nice! Lots of nice chairs The beach right in front of Vik was really crowded. The chairs looked cheap there was alot of trash in certain areas
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Strong current in the morning but you can't beat the view! Even the salt-water aroma is wonderful to wake up to. Get there early to get a little hut for shade.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Water was warm and colorful. Wind kept waves high and often. plenty of beach loungers and chairs. lots of activity from staff.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,One of the best beaches I've seen in my life. The sand was very warm and soft on your feet. And very clean. The waters were perfect temperature and clear as glass.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Been away a full week without the beach AND MISS IT!!!Wonderful time and the sandbeach water was out of this world!!A few ball headed bartenders which was fun but for anyone whom does NOT like this beach............pickypicky picky!!! Just overwhelms your senses of things going on and cannot wait to go back!!!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,It was a nice beach...clean but the water was cold for the caribbean and the swimming area was small.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Gorgeous!! White powdery sand warm turquoise water no sharp rocks/seashells... what else can you ask for?
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Unspoilt and wonderful. Miles of white sand and warm water. If you go early in the morning you will have it all to yourself.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The Bavaro beach was incredible. Very clean water was warm and we loved the nice breeze coming in. Not much (If any) trash on the beach and no vendors which was nice you could relax in peace!!!!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Sand was amazing and the water incredibly warm. The water was calm enough that we were able to swim in the ocean most days! Although there were some weed beds they did not affect our swimming. Weeds that washed ashore were cleaned up by the resort and not an issue - did not deter from enjoying the beach.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Best ever! Gorgeous white sugar sand turquoise water fun waves. Didn't encounter any sea life in the area we stayed at this time. Not even sea grass. Perfectly clear salt water. Breath taking!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,White sugar sand and crystal clear water make for a perfect beach experience. You can't go wrong here. Haggle with the beach-side vendors and you can get great deals on everything.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,White sandy beaches as far as the eye can see and clear blue water. It was like walking into a photograph.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Loved this beach very pretty!! You can walk up and down the beach go to the huts and barter with the locals for their merchandise. They will try to make the price very high you can really talk them down on the price you have to be firm and if you don't agree on price just walk away!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Great for morning walks in either direction. Lots to see. amazing how many people are out walking at 6 in the morning. Beautiful sunrise if you get up early enough.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,One of the most beautiful beaches in the world. The water is crystal blue and the sand is white and very soft. The water is very warm and clean.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,stayed at resort...did not travel anywhere on island....not many activities that are free...very discouraging...all the entertainment was in spanish...drinks were watered down
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beach has great soft sand and is kept very clean. However the water does have nice waves and can get rough.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,I enjoyed the beach it was amazing and clean. The area on the beach where my resort was located was topless and adults only..by far the best
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,beach had nice white sand but the shoreline never cleaned from the washed up seaweed...Very windy there and the water was rough
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Staff are great and fun. We were there.on our last trip as well as our most current trip. Misinformed b y resort staff as to what was included (we thought we were swimming with sharks but that was extra).
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,spacious beach lots of chairs. beds warm water and a nice breeze. Enjoyed the beach market to the left. Lots of tikki huts for shade too.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Very good beach and clear water. Trees with shadows and always light wind. Soft sand and that it. It is enough in my opinion about beach
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Gorgeous beach. Too much seaweed at times but that is nature. Water was beautiful and the beach was great
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Guests need to stop leaving their rubbish on the beach and clear up after themselves. The beach goes on for miles and is really beautiful
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,There are only good things to say about the Bavaro Beach walk for miles and miles - shop if you like - swim when you want - the water was great no seaweed - soft white sand
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The ocean waves roll very strong when they approach the beach. You must have very strong legs in order not to be overtaken by the ocean waves. This is my second trip to this location and it always seems to be the same with the ocean waves.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beautiful water!endless ocean calm waves clean white sand....cant say anymore....breathtaking!!! one of the best beaches ive ever seen
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beautiful white sand cool on the feet. Easy to walk on. Lots of palm trees. A constant breeze. Clean.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Loved It ! Very clean  nice to snorkel . The most beautiful beach I have been in the caribbean so far. Try to find a spot far from big resorts private beach which tend to be too crowded .
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,We stayed at the adults only part of the resort and the beach front here was quiet and calm with ample beach chairs for everyone. It was clean and beautiful.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Excellent beach. Too much debris (twigs tree needles etc ) in water. 5 minute walk up the beach and water was clear.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Love it!! Beach was clean and very clear waters!!!! Fun in the sun!!! Would recommend highly to all!!! My husband went parasailing and we have memories for a lifetime!!!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,everything about it was excellent.Can't wait to go again.The resort was amazing very cleanand well maintained very friendly staff.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,White sand turqouise sea and palm trees heaven. The best stretch of beach in the Dominican. We stayed in the Vik Arena Blanca near to the beach huts selling some great gifts. We were more than halfing original prices though so make sure you haggle. Teams cleaning the beach constantly from any rubbish or seaweed.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,lots of palms always seaweed but amounts vary with season entertaining with pirate ships motorized flying wings and parasailers
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The best beach we've been to and we have traveled to many in the Carribean and elsewhere. Clean soft white sand without rocks and shells No shoes needed!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Nice white sand my only dislike was the constant helicopter noise they have three helicopters that fly over the resorts every few minutes
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Miles of sand to walk along .( we were told not to walk to far at night but why would you?) There was plenty of water sports like sailingpara gliding kyaking and more.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Fantastic sand and you can walk for miles. Lots of people and always plenty to see. The water is clean and warm and the beaches are always so clean.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,getting up early on vacation to reserve a chair or hut the water was really warmand clear blue/green
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,We stayed at the Iberostar Bavaro and truly loved Bavaro Beach. It was white and sandy though some would find it a little windy but that was great for us as our children loved the waves.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,we have been to many beaches internationally and this is one of our favorites. the water is crystal clear and the sand is fine and white. there are a lot of Europeans there so if you have young children be aware that they may see more than they want!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Clear water clean white sand beach. Heaven! Stay away from the market at the end. The sellers there are very pushy and get upset when you don't purchase from them.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The water is warm clear and the most amazing color that I don't even think has a name that does it justice. The sand is so white and soft that I didn't want to leave. I enjoy how calm it is. The slight waves are fantastic. There is nowhere else I'd rather be.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,White powdery coral sand palm trees very picturesque. Banana boats and used condoms to so picturesque.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,wish there had been more activities to get kids involved but otherwise it was heavenly; hope to return soon!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beauty but lots of seaweed. It was very warm though and calm. There are nicer beaches in the area I believe.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Crystal clear water... fine soft sand... Perfect balance between waves and calmness. This is the nicest beach I have been to and would definitely recommend it or Punta Cana beaches.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,I liked everything the only thing I din't like was leaving all the wonderful people I met. I will be back there this year for sure for vacation
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,We were planning to have very good experience  relatively new resort pricy etc.. Was not that great.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The nicest beach I have ever been too. Only problem was a small 50 yard section of shops that had harassing vendors.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beach was cleaned everyday. The sea was fairly warm. Had to get onto beach fairly early if you needed an umbrella!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The water was amazing and the sand was pristine. Many gorgeous bodies walking the beach. Lots of activities going on each day.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beautiful crystalline waters. Looks like a postcard. White sandy beaches small waves makes it perfect for people with children.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Great sand (doesn't get hot) and great water. Watch the son it is very strong. Try catamaran sailing
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,great beach and ocean view servers happy to bring you drinks. Walk down to the Yellow house and get some awxome souvenires
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beach in Punta Cana is nice. But until they get better at running their resort this is the only positive thing about the Dominican Republic
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Big waves deep water beautiful sand- there are no complaints except people bothering you to buy something all the time but welcome to the 3rd world.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Gorgeous calm clean and warm water. Workmen were out constantly raking up seaweed that had washed ashore. Recreation personnel were on the beach a couple of times a day offering exercise classes and games.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Nothing to dislike about the Riu Palace Bavaro -food terrific clean rooms clean pools great service - all around a five star resort for sure!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Great to see ocean everyday. Nothing like listening to the ocean and having a ice cold beer. The view is breath taking.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,White sand pristine beach. There is a lot of boat activity but swimming areas are designated. No selling allowed on the beach (at least never saw anyone)...the flea market area will give you that aspect.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,We walked for miles both ways along this beach - can get lots of seaweed. Sea is warm and you can easily lose a few hours walking it...
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,All of it very clean as staff cleaned up the beach all day.the whole thing was everything i could have wished for AND more.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,With its white sand and clear blue water Bavaro beach is one of the best the DR has to offer. YOu can walk for miles and enjoy the some of the prettiest scenes there are in the DR.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,seaweed and construction debris all over beach. No empty chaises. Beach a long way from hotel room. waiters and bartenders often got orders wrong.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beach was clean safe and beautiful. Many vacationers were walking wading and swimming. The water was crystal clear waves were gentle and the beach sloped gently into the ocean. Plenty of children as well as adults were playing in the waves.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,What a beautiful beach-I miss it already! Loved the color warmth and shops on the beach. Erosion is an issue and sandbags were lined along our resort.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,beach was beautiful but watch out for sand flies! I walked the beach in the evening and have itchy red bited covering my lower legs ankles and feet. Even insect repellent with Deet didn't help me!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,We have been here several times and it is just as lovely as the first time we saw it. What we really appreciate is the fact that you can walk out into the water without hurting your feet on rocks like you do in Mexico. Hope to be back many more times.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Best beach I've seen. Soft fine sand smooth ramp into the water no nuisance beach trade long unimpeded walks along the beach. Enough shade under the palm trees.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,White soft sand great for long walks. Waves fun for frolicking in the warm water! Lots of activities available.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Probably in the top 20 best beaches of the world. Crystal clear waters with coral and tropical fish.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Such a gorgeous beach. White sand and looked very clean. Palm trees everywhere. Definitely amazing. Happy we booked a resort on this beach.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Whitest powder sand...groomed daily....palm trees on the beach rather than the thatched roof palapas they have on other beaches
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,This beach is to Punta Cana as Niagara Falls is to Canada - A great Tourist attraction where you can relax and enjoy the view or spend lots of money on para sailing or peddlers on the beach!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Miles of white sandy beach. No waves no shells no rocks. Plenty of palm trees for shade. Catamarans kayaks paddle boats Free For resort guest. Entertainment games volley ball bingo. Or sit a little further down for peace and quiet.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beautiful clean beach. I loved being able to relax on the beach and not be bothered by locals badgering me to buy their trinkets. The ocean was clear and it was fun to watch the pirate ship coast back and forth.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,I think if anyone is looking for a great fun filled vacation this is a great place to go ... There's a disco close by (walking distance meaning 2 minutes away) there's a casino and great staff !!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,One of the most beautiful beaches I have been to. The beach is fairly clean with a little seaweed with the high tides but perfect water and waves.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Very long beach so lots of room for everyone. Just watch little ones as the undertow can be quite strong at times. Some seaweed especially after a storm but not worth worrying about.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Amazing beach.well worth a long flight.the type of beach you see in movies.golden sands and warms sea
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Paradise the beach looks like a postcard the water looks turquoise blue from the beach. Water was on the cooler side but once inside it was comfortable. Thank God we didn't see any naked bodies.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,It's really super crowded full of people  over rated and totally expensive . The shops there are out of control regarding the Prices for everything . If you have a hotel beach it might be ok but not as a free beach .
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Busy resort has issues keeping up with amount of people using beachfront. "The green team" tries very hard but some guest are just down right messy!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Gorgeous Beach!!! One of the best I've ever seen!! You can walk forever and it only gets more beautiful!!!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beach is long and beautiful sand. There are a lot of hotels on the beach but there is ample room to walk for miles
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Very clean-saw 22 guys cleaning from of our resort (eel grass) one AM while running. Water is like bath water and can swim forever! Feeding bread to fish was fun
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beautiful emerald and blue waters. Great comfort with wicker chase lounges and drinks on the beach. Access to both private and public beach. Soft and beautiful sand. A little too much seaweed but our beach had a groomer to clean it up regularly.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,I loved the beach!! beautiful clean white sand and clear waters. I can't describe the experience...you must go to see how great it was.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,We looked out to the beach from our room at Punta Cana Princess it is sixty km's long of beautiful white sand and blue ocean what more could you ask for!!!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,I've been coming to Punta Cana for 5 years now and this year I found the beach to be looking a bit shabby. Hotel staff work very hard at picking up after slobs but it appears the slobs are winning. There was garbage in the water and along the stone walls on all the properties. It was also overcrowded.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,We loved the area it was beautiful clean and no garbage. We were never bothered by vendors or such and enjoyed walking in the waves.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The sand was so soft and the sea was clear as a bell! Fantastic! It's great jumping the waves when the sea is choppy - we had a lot of fun doing this.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beautiful beach but depends on a hotel of course. Best is at Ambar other hotels's beach is not that clean. Many coconuts on the beach. Hotels have sand sculptures which are very nice.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Bavaro Beach is absolutely beautiful! We were able to walk a long ways and it was always a white sandy beach with clear blue water. Unbelievable!!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Water is beautiful undertow strong & a lot of waves. Bavaro Beach is not on the Caribbean it is the Alantic beach side of the island.In all fairness I live on the beach in S.C. U.S. and I scub so I prefer the clam waters.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,You can walk the beach for miles. Beautiful whites sands. A couple of markets along the beach. Didn't like being "attacked" by the sellers and as soon as I would purchase they called me an American...whatever that means ?
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Breathtaking. loved it!! The beach was clean and clear of seaweed etc. The waves were nice and not too big. I would love to go back:)
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beautiful white sand always clean & gorgeous turquoise water. The water was calm enough to enjoy but still had some waves coming in to add to the ambience.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beautiful white sand as in the water. Very warm and clean.Lots of facitities near the beach as well as near the swimming pools.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Plenty of bright sunshine on the beach while we were there although the winds were strong during our stay. Not much time spent in the water but plenty of tanning time. Great little shaded areas as well as places under the palm trees to tan. VERY clean and the sand was SO very fine. Beautiful beach!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Too much sea grass..... but beautiful views..... used to beaches in Turks..... second to none. It was a little rough so that could have been the problem...... did not like looking at the dolphin pens.... kinda wrecked the view.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,On our arrival the beach had not been cleaned(Sunday). On subsequent days there were crews that picked up the seaweed that accumulated on the beach. Great beach regardless. Flat and fairly wide in most areas. The beach was busier than expected--more people than say Cancun.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Turquoise water white sand palm trees super-clean plenty of shade drinks music buffet on the water.............. What's not to like?
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Clean beach with swaying palm trees. Smooth not rocky beach was a plus! There were plenty of lounge chairs and bathrooms nearby.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beach was nice and clean the number of people walking up and down made it seem like NYC. Not exactly peaceful except at dawn and dusk.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Lovely clean and plenty of sun beds plenty of palm trees for anyone wanting shade sea can be a little rough at times but lovely for swimming
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Whether walking NW or SE from the burnt out restaurant at Cortecito beach you are assured of a beautiful water's edge stroll for almost as far as the eye can see! Highly recommended as a morning pastime: Lots of good things to see on land sea or in the air.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,You have to pay $100 per person to go diving which is outrageous since small kids are unable to follow in deep waters and just want to feed some bread to a bunch of "Nemo"
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Gorgeous beach/water. However it was impossible to swim most days as the waves were too strong. Also you had to be there before 8 am each day to find a decent chair & umbrella.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Typical caribbean beach clear blue waters lots of beach shacks and plenty of vendors selling their wares
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,There were plenty of chairs to sit in and huts to stay under to avoid the sun. It was mostly grown ups so didn't have to deal with the Spring Break crowd.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Bavaro Beach is a beautiful white sandy beach which stretches for miles. The ocean is a beautiful turquoise color and the palm tress literally frame the beach. It is breathtaking.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,This beach is flat and goes for miles...if you love to beach walk this is the place for you! The cool breeze on the beach will cool you down from the intense sun and the beach area is one resort after another. It's a busy beach with plenty to see.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Love Bavaro Beach!!! It's so clean and pretty. turquoise water and white sand for miles. Water was pretty warm when we went in March as well
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Bavaro Beach is pristine with powdery white sand....aqua blue clear water and no sea grass! At times it can be a bit rough that has to do with the weather conditions but there are always colored flags to indicate the roughness!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Great beach! I just dislike a beach for family having ladies doing topless.I think you can expect that in adult resorts but family resorts...should be not allowed.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,I have never seen such a beautiful beach. The sand is soft and luxurious. It is easy to get in and out of the water for a swim. The water is gorgeous!!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beach was white soft sand. The groundkeepers cleaned the beach every morning by hand. The water was crystal blue.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Bavaro beach is a beautiful beach with white sand well-maintained and blue water. It is quiet a large beach so long walks on the beach are great!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Everything was as we expected and more. The golf course is in a magnificient shape and the "a la carte" restaurants are excellent.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,This beach was not white and sandy it was a beach. The sad thing is you walk the beach and see all these nice things and then you get by an area that no hotels are and the place turns into the garbage dump. They do not take care of there trash system very well.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beach was amazing. Nice white sand lots of chairs. You could sit right in the sun or in the shade.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beach is lovely and clean with very little seaweed. It goes on for miles so is great for long leisurely walks. Plenty of watersports available
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beautiful beautiful beautiful beach that you can walk for miles on. Lots to do from market shopping and water sports.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beach is absolutely phenomenal! We walked the beach every day. You could walk both north and south from Bavaro Princess for many km’s passing endless resorts.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The Beaches are awesome and go for miles. Only small down fall to getting front row lounging chairs or a palm covered Umbrella was you had to get there by 6.15 am to put your towells and a shirt to hold your 2 or 4 chairs.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,This soft sandy beach goes for miles and you can walk forever. The water is warm and pleasant. The food is great the staff friendly and helpful.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Good beach for taking the sun swimming or walking. The beach is policed by the tourist police and you do not get hassle from the sellers
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Water is beautiful and warm enough to swim in. Sand never gets hot I don't know why and its very clean.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,In february the water is not that warm (about 26C) but it's good enough for a swim :) The sand is very thin and the waters are a teal-like colour.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Lovely swimmable water. Long walks. Efforts to preserve nature so most resorts are set far off of beach
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The view the sand the ladiesthe restaurant and beach volley. Talking to people from all around the world
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Clear blue water and powdery sand. Not trouble getting beach chairs. No compaints except only one beach bar and could use two.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Clean  very fine pale amber sand almost pure white. Lots of shade from palms & pines. Clean clear water and swimmable ocean but with some nice larger waves. Sections of the beach area have a type of pine tree that sheds small prickley cones. This are should be raked more often.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Crowded but nice. Tide was strong water was warm. Get there early to get good seats but they were always available . Enjoyed the pool areas better
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beach was absolutely gorgeous whether you are laying on the beach or sailing during the day or strolling along at night!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,This beach was kept very clean. There were tractor sand cleaners that passed early each morning and staff raked up the washed up seaweed during the day. This beautifully clean beach was populated but not over crowded. We were always able to find good beach lounge chairs without a problem.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Great beach well maintained and clean. Lots of activities to do lots of chairs we went everyday at different times of the day and were always to able to find three chairs.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Waves aren't too rough so you are able to get in the water and swim. The sand is very soft. The resorts try to pick up the seaweed daily so it's very clean.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Probably to the most beautiful beach I've ever seen. The water was crystal clear and BRIGHT turquoise blue. It doesn't get any better beach wise.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,i love the beach gorgeousnot enough selection for restaurants. almost all inclusives around and the ones open are expensive and not good quality foodalthough there are good restaurants a bit further than stanza mare hotel yummy and inexpensive
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,We didn't go in the water it was very warm but there were too many big waves. The water is a beautiful color. You can walk for miles and enjoy the beauty of it all.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beautiful white sands.Relaxing atmosphere.Not crowdedlike East coast USA beachs.THis place is easy to get used to.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,too much sea grass around hotel property too many peaople in small area adjusted for hotel use not picture perfect beach as other places I visited
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Went parasailing on this beach got to see the whole coast . Gret view  good time. Clean  clear water and white sands.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The experience was wonderful all except the deep sea fishing. Rough seas and fish did not bite. Would not fish there again.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beautiful quiet beach. No one to bother you aside from the waiters seeking to bring you refreshments.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Bavaro Beach is vast and beautiful with many water sports available. Remember the water can be rough where the Atlantic and Caribbean Sea meet. Vendors do come around to sell merchandise but will leave after a simple "No". Weather was very schizophrenic in January with sudden high winds and rain and then sunny again.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,We had a bad experience with our resort and the beach made up for it. By far the most beautiful I have seen.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The clear fine sand was awesome. Weather was wonderful! Not too many vendors on the beach which was a plus!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Great beach and very soft beautiful sand. The water is so clear. It does not look real. It is so relaxing to just sit back and watch the waves roll in. There are a few vendors selling goods as they walk up and down the beach
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The sand is white and clean and the water is turquoise just beautiful . There are many activities one the beach the people are so nice and try to show you a good time.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,We have been to Mexico Turks and Caicos and the Bahamas. This is my favorite. Pure white sand and Beautiful warm aqua water!!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,This is the best beach I have been to so far. Long white and pink sand so soft. If you stay by Grand Paradise the water has big fun waves. No. Undertow. If you stay up by IFA calm waters and some boats. You will love the water and beach.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,You can not go to Punta Cana without making a trip here. Don't think you are on Bavaro just because you are staying in Punta Cana. Well worth the walk down the beach. Smooth crystal waters and powder white sand. Don't know how to find it from your resort just ask someone or look it up on the map.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,This Beach is just gorgeous the view is Awesome for miles! I would definitely go back in a heart beat! Clean & well maintained!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,White sandy beach clean blue sea warm tropical breeze just fabulous a joy to visit. We stayed for 2 weeks in a nearby resort in January 13. It is the most amazing place. In January it is rainy season so expect some heavy showers but as soon as they come they go no problem.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The best beach I have ever been on. Thirty two miles of pure white talcum powder sand. Turquoise clear blue sea.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,White sands calm turquoise water gentle breezes and lots to see and do! There are vendor kiosks which sell typical tourist fate at very inflated prices. There are nice little water front bars and restaurants. We just pick a spot lay out and relax and every day we meet someone new from somewhere far away.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,There are no ugly beaches in DR thats for sure. Clean clear water and just a small amount of seaweed from time to time floating up.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,beach is very nice with clear turquoise water. however careful as the area is very windy which can be a problem sometimes.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,No shells no seaweed crystal clear water and the sand was so so soft! The club area is a little tight but there is plenty of room in the non-club area.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The Bavaro beach is such a long beautiful stretch of beach....the sand is super soft and fine.....the water is just gorgeous ! No sea shells though......you have to dive for those !
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,We booked the 'Bavaro Splash!' excursion and it was excellent! The speed boat racing and snuba in particular were excellent.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Platinum club needs to remove towels off of unused lounge chairs alot of guests place towels on chairs and never show up to sit in them preventing others from using them even though there is a sign saying after 30 minutes it is free for the taking.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,It is recommended as one of the ten most beautiful beaches in the world. And that is no lie. Beautiful white sand and perfect blue sea. Nice temperature as well. Good swimming.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Lovely sandy beach that stretches for miles. Couple this with the Royal Suites Turquesa and you have the perfect holiday.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,When the wind is up the surf offshore is great!! Be prepared to have everything from cigars to trips to various animal photo-ops flogged on the beach(they take no for an answer quite well
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beautiful soft sand but beach is suffering from evident and significant erosion. The beach is narrow in parts and one can tell that the level has dropped by about a meter. Palm tree root balls along the beach are seriously exposed.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,It is a nice beach but it is very heavily populated due to number of hotels spread out along the front
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beautiful - miles and miles and miles of white sand and crystal clear blue water. Vendors on Beach can be a problem but if you firmly say "No thank you" they will leave you alone.....
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Best beach I've ever been to. Wonderful white sand lots of palm trees for shade and no need for watershoes here as the ocen has a wonderful sandy bottom.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Found the seaweed very bad compared to when we were there 2 yrs ago in March.Maybe its the time of the year? sea weed kept filling my bathing suit! LOL
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Great colours with soft white sand. What post cards are made of except the eye sores of stingray bay and company. Commercializing the ocean is never good.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,beautiful water great for swimming but has alot of locals pushing products just say no thank you and everything will be fine
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,This beach was breathtaking and very clean! Never saw trash or weeds. Always loungers available. They had many activities like sand volleyball paddle boards wake boards were free to use parasailing available. Local vendors walked the beach but never bother you unless you ask them you to come over.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,We stayed at Barcelo Bavaro Palace Deluxe.It was a magnificent place to stay  and the beaches were clean and inviting . We walked it every day  and there were lots of lounges to sit on . The water is clean and clear and such a pretty color  just like the pictures .
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,This beach is just beautiful! This beach offers tons of white sand and blue water!! walking from your resort either way is just as beautiful from where you started!! Bring a few bucks and stop along the way at the shops that have a lot to offer and don't forget to try to get the best deal!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,It's impossible not to fall in love with this beach perfect water palm trees and white sand make it a paradise!

g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Great beach very clean very Friendly people that work the Beach soft white sand we stayed at GBP Turqusea. The ride to the beach was great
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,We walked the beach two different times. The waves lapped at your feet (note: not the kind of waves to body surf in). The water was many shades of blues and greens. A beautiful beach!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beautiful beach! White sands clear blue water what more can I say? Oh the water was warm. When I went there was a strong undertow so be very careful specially if you have small children. Can't snorkel at the resort but bring a boogie board. The waves can be a lot of fun!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beach was good. Alot of guys on the beach trying to sell timeshares they are a little hard to get away from. Don't like to hear no thanks. But all in all the beach was nice.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Warm clear water lots of white sand moderate waves nice little cafes on the beach for food and drinks

g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The most beautiful white sand beach I have ever seen. Sand is powdery white and the water is a beautiful shade of turquoise. You can walk for miles without stepping on rocks or shells. The resorts keep the beach very clean sweeping seaweed every morning.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beautiful beautiful beach... could barely believe my eyes. White sand beaches with turquous waters and not too rough like cancun has been when I visited there.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,very busy beach - lots to look at! Water warm waves easy to swim in most days sand fleas were definitely a problem - bring insect repellent.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Soft white sand lots of little huts and chaise lounges clear blue blue blue water!!! No beach vendors where we were but a little shopping place in one area. Lots of water sports snorkeling scuba parasailing. Beaches were not crowded when we were there (Feb 013).
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beautiful white sand -turquoise water. Can walk for miles on the beach. Only thing we didn't like was that resort people would beacon you to come in and look at their resort so that you could go there on your next vacation.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Sand water and sun. Nice lounges and the hotel pretty much keeps the riff raft away. There is a reef about 400 M out which breaks up the surf and undertow.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,White sand waves!! always enjoyable. Great for Long walks. We walked from Ocean sands to teh Ambar where we have stayed preiviously. It is an hour walk each way but very enjoyable. Great for people watching
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Great drink service on the beach lots of lounge chairs sun and shade! There were a lot of people walking the beach water was beautiful. Some people wanted topless (signs were posted "no topless") some did it anyway.

g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Soft white sandy beaches that is relaxing in so many ways.The entire beach is lined with resorts until you get to the nearest town. Watch out for the hustlers. Everything is for sale.

g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Nice sandy beach a bit of waves at some areas and the sand drops in the water in some areas too overall nice beach also a must is to check out some of the other amazing beaches on the island too. I hope this review is helpful.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,It was a lovely white beach and you can walk and walk and walk! And we did! Weather was beautiful! Even enjoyed going to the shopping mall right on the beach. Be sure to barter they start out at ridiculous prices! But it was fun!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,You can walk along it gorgeous soft sand but there is a coral line in the distance. So if you like looking for shells you won't find any... they've all been swept into the coral that is too far for you to swim too...
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Spacious clean rooms. Great beach exercise groups. Good food good wine. Loved the atmosphere. Value for the dollar & relaxing. Take the spa boat for 1/2 day - well worth it.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,I walked for miles. The sand is like white powder and the water is beautiful. Much of the beach however was a bit crowded for my taste but I really didn't expect anything less.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Supposed to be an Adult resort but they fail to tell you that the beach is public. Plagued with people selling coconuts cigarettes and cheap beads.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Wonderful beach to take walks and enjoy the water & people. They have parasailing tube riding and you can even drive a speed boat
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,One of the most beautiful beaches on the Caribbean. White soft sand clear warm water great for swimming and long walks on the beach
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,It was a beautiful beach. January is quite windy but the sand is soft and the waves can be a little rough at times but it was still an amazing beach.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beautiful white sand- loved being in out hut and also walking the beach throughout the day. Heavenly!!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The Bavaro beach is good and has nice sand The beach area was nice and secure. We saw resorts security roaming around to make sure all was safe. You can walk on the beach in either direction; there is one resort after another and lots of people walking around.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,the whether In January is not good a lot of rains very windy a lot of clouds stormy water. This is is not first time in January.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Well maintained. The sand is white. The coconut palms everywhere. Well cleaned the beach and the ocean by the resort stuff.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Teh beach was clean and well maintained. Can't think i anything I did not like about the beach. The little huts we perfect for getting out of the sun if you wanted to. I also LOVED that there was beaverage service on the beach.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beach has turquoise water Spotless clean white sand and great for swimming. Can be rough sometimes just depends on weather
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beach is long white and very pretty. It has a lot of other hotels on it making it quite busy. It resembles a beach in Daytona beach florida.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,You can walk for hours in each direction and not reach the end. Beautiful and clean. Everyday you can catch several weddings while strolling.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Cleaned everyday staff very friendly. Only dislike are the helicopters who flew buy too often! Noise!!!!!!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,It was clean clear and perfect! There are lots of waves and people walking up and down the beach from other resorts. There is a local open air flee market on the beach for shopping.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Great water sports options on this beach: winds ailing; parasailing; speed boats; scuba. At secrets we had huts available to all guest so that we did not have to rent chairs etc. we also had drink service on beach
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Amazing sand so fine! Just beautiful! No one bothers you along the beach as long as you stay within the resort! Love it there!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Not sure if it was because it was January but the wind was unbelievable. Difficult to stay on the beach as the sand was whipping around and building large dunes! The ocean was warm but the water was pretty rough...too windy to sail on 3 out of 5 days.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,it is a long beach to walk and run and walk.. no end more sand.. and some markets very closed to sea
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,very clean water very nice beach and people . I hope to return as soon as possible to Dominican Republic
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Bavaro beach was incedible. The Greek Grill at Bavaro beach was fun and the food was great. The people were helpful and kind.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,White sands and absolutely clear blue waters. The resorts beach area is extremely clean and well maintained Stunning!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beautiful white sand but full of cigarette butts. It could be improved by sweeping it daily and providing ashtrays to smokers.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,We had the best time everyday at the beach and the waves were the best... The food was excellent and the activities on thre beach were fun as well...

g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,the hard packed white sand and no sand fleas. Breeze off the water frindliness of everyone a beatiful experience that I would like to do again.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,What can I say? This beach is fantastic. Miles and miles of white sand and Palm trees. Almost as nice as the deserted Saona island beach!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beach was clean and pretty but as soon as you get out of your vechicle there is locals trying to sell you stuff and are pretty persistant
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,This resort had a great beach front - staff cleaned it early every morning so all the debris was gone. They had tons of beach chairs & shade huts. The only downfall was the people pushing for excursions.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Gorgeous white sand beach with crystalline blue waters. Peaceful although there was a rash of pine needles!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Gorgeous sand and water breathtaking! Water was so blue and the sand was clean with no rocks or shells
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Great beach that had lots of room it was clean and had a shallow water depth for quite a ways out. The sand was clean with really no seashells. The water was a wonderful blue and green colour and looked very clean.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,This is one beach location which lives up to the hype- the beach is wide veeery long and not overly busy despite the resorts that are lining it. They keep swimmers and watersports strictly separate and the Bach slopes very gently making it ideal for child's and the non-swimme.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The hotel was conveniently located a short distance from the airport . The food was delicious the hotel was quiet and never any food lines and great service. Our only complaint would be the golf fees seemed very costly @ a non optional 65 dollars per golfer per golf cart
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,I can't wait to return. no rocks water was warm with no creatures! The only drawback is the locals badgering you.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Clean friendly and open. Not alot of people on the beach area so easy to find a spot to lay back and enjoy.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beach is very picturesque but gets deep really fast  strong pull even from a few feet in great for walking but not for swimming  or snorkelling
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Warm water no seaweed at our location and white sand. No rocks in the shallow water but further out (before the ropes) a few with tropical fish. Bring your mask and snorkel.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,lots of seaweed but they do a pretty good job of cleaning it up in the morning and also very strong tides
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Pretty beach. We stayed in Cap Cana in 2010 and thought that beach was prettier but it is really nice. Lots of seaweed but our resort kept their section clean.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Paradise soft sand blue sea and a lovely breeze. Very clean and shade if you want it from the palm trees.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Loved Loved this beach... Water was fantastic. The sand was great...the beach was wonderful to walk on and the surf was terrific.. Too bad our resort sucked so bad!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The chairs are great. You have a selection to prop the chair up under your knees. The beach is very clean.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The sand is beautiful to walk on soft and powdery. You can literally walk for miles! I felt safe. The water is beautiful ... Perfect temperature and the beach is kept very clean.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,I stayed at the Ambar which is located just of Bavaro Beach (I think) it was fanastic. Beautiful like no other. I can't wait to go back.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,I love walking & swimming therefore this is the perfect beach for me. The sunrises are incredible as I'm usually on the beach by 0600am.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,This beach was terrific. Although it was quite crowded it was kept clean and the water is beautiful. Other than the venders trying to sell you on everything I have no complaints about this beach.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,really enjoyed snuba Guide was wonderful! We had an underwater camera and he took lots of pictures for us. We purchased a video but didn't get it. Asked the Sun Quest tour guide to look into it and email us when we got to the airport but no response. Live and learn!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Teh beach is a long one but very naroow and crowded. Whire sand and a palm trees to take pictures but difficult to appear alene as the beach is crowded.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,I enjoyed very long swimming in the ocean. There are always waves... If you prefer calm water - this beach is not for you.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Wide long and white powder sand. Lots of hotels along the beach with a market area near our hotel.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Long stretch of beach white sands beautiful weather. I recommend paragliding - you fly above the whole Place.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Too crowded the waters fully exploited by numerous watersports. It is nice though to walk on the beah and have a look at the hotels that all line up. Unfortunately they are impossible to visit as guards stop you at any attempt!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Cleansoft sandy beaches! Clear tourquois water. Gentle tropical breeze provides a comfortable temperature.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Great beach but to crowded during this time of the year at least in the area I was. There were several resorts one after the other.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The water is a beautiful blue and the beach is soft and white with lots of Palm trees. Plenty of opportunitys to get that great photo to remember the trip
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Cleanest beach in the world! White sand beuatiful people and crystal clear water! I can't wait to go back next year : )
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The sand is white and soft. The water is blue and clear. The most perfect beach I have ever seen or been on.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Very long stretch of beach so I could take long walks which I love and it was very clean! I enjoyed checking out the other resorts on the beach to compare with the resort we were staying at. I also passed a resort we stayed at a number of years ago which was nice. Brought back other wonderful holiday memories!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Nice beach..very windy the past few days..yellow and red flags...so windy today no parasailers. Not sure if it is always windy or just time of year. Great beach to walk on. Good sand clean. Try a fresh coconut for $2..get a frozen drink from the bar and pour it in...yummy.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,This really nice beach and the breeze makes it great during the hotter hours. 11-2. It is a public beach (as all of DR is) but the vendors are not a bother and are never pushy as in some other countries.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Great beach for walking. Nice area to swim. Beautiful fine white sand. Stay away from the flea market at the end.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beach was beautiful.The water was cold so did not get in it but crystal clear.Lots of people @ the beach so lots of people watching.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Narrow beach but lots of sun beds. Clean and not to busy. Minimal sales people bothering you high tide makes it hard to walk all the way along.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,too much sea weed in the water and the sand is too compact. it seemed very average to us. we did not see many people in the water
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beach was clean water was clear and taken care of early each morning. You can kayak parasail sail snorkel etc.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,We stayed in Punta Cana at the GBP Esmeralda. We spent most of our days on this beautiful beach. Loved Taking long strolls along the soft white sand
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beaches in Punta Cana are great white sand beautiful Caribbean Sea.... but be careful of the undertow
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,beach was nice small crowded and lots and lots of seaweed. Constantly there were workers raking up the seaweed trying to keep it under control.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beautiful beach even if rougher waters. Clean. Great for long walks. One day we walked over 3 km one way to a cluster of souvenir shops right on the water. Rustic!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,You could walk on this beach for miles (I believe it is 22 miles long). It is lined with palm trees and the sand is so soft. The water is a beautiful turquois with waves lapping the shore. I never got tired of looking at it or walking on it.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,This beach is one of my favourites and i have travelled clean hot a bit breezy but it is a godsend taxi boats to take you snorkeling all water activities and fantastic hotels all along great place fab people
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Availability depends on buying food at the beach restaurants or staying at one of the many luxury hotels.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Sand was soft and white. Water was clear clean calm and not too salty. One of the best beached ever visited.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,best part of the trip except for the sea weed that washes up with the tide. Can't do much about that though.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,it was close to 90 everyday except one day we had typoon weather. The beaches were prestine and the water too!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Did not see it for the last 9 years a lot of new resorts around a lot of people but still amazing vistas. Amazing place!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Crystal blue water gorgeous white sand I lived here for an entire week while at the Hard Rock Punta Cana. Very clean and well maintained
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Lot's of sea weed that were not picked up by any hotels even the big ones and beach is partially eaten away by ocean
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,just an amazing beach so clean lots of bars never run dry cant wait to go back next year. nice walk down the beach to the market cheapy cheapy prices lol
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,white sand the long walks on the beach gorgeous view of the ocean the people are friendly 25 - 35 minutes from airport!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Keeps us coming back 2 x per year..most beautiful beach ever. Water is warm and clean and no sharks. Always inviting and clean
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,It was the perfect combination of sun and shade with the added bonus of a sense of safety and cleanliness.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beach has all the elements you expect from a tropical paradise. Powdery white sand that is cool to walk on. Tall palm trees growing out of the sand. Turquoise water. Heaven.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The waves were intense but lots of fun - need to be careful of the undertow but the lifeguards were very mindful
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,This beach has lovely soft sand and the water is a dreamy aqua-it is a long stretch of beach too. There are many hotels and some areas that are wild too.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Except for the seaweed there is nothing to dislike about this beach. Clean sand (powdery and soft to touch) calm waters and slowly sloping beach make it the best way to enjoy the sea.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beautiful beach great for long walks good snorkling too must of seen 10 weddings on the beach that week perfect place for it. Seaweed yes there is some but please remember that when there is seaweed on your beach it is great for you just enjoy it breath deeply and take it all in.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Clean safe lots of lounge chairs no need to reserve one at 6am. There are vendors but they are monitored by security. The water was warm and the sun was strong.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Majestic Elegance Club has a private beach with tiki huts and wait staff to serve drinks on the beach. Loved it all.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Loved the water the sand the entire beach. Disliked the typical rowdy American tourist that throws trash on the beach for others to pick up. DR and Punta Cana locals are awesome and friendly.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,People try to sell you junk on the beach but the water is very clear and it was aesthetically nice.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,soft and white not dirty no shells always being cleaned. Not bothered by salespeople. You'll love it!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Too crowded on GBP area beach. Lovely water and lovely sand. The coral reefs at sea break up the waves so theres very small waves coming ashore.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Sand is fine and so soft and kept very clean! Views are amazing. You can walk for miles and miles.......
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Very nice beach. Sometimes the water was rough so we could not swim but when it was possible it was very nice and the water was very clean
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Love it! its clean white and very soft to the touch. Even if it is really hot the sand is not! No burned feet! And you don't have to stay withing the resort to walk on it...you can go as far as you want.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,We went Horseback riding on this beach and it was gorgeous! Only bummer is you weren't able to run the horses but still amazing!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beach is a wonderful place to relax. The pools are great but the beach is so much more relaxing. I could just sit there and listen to the water for hours. It is also much cooler by the beach the breeze feels wonderful.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beach and water was beautiful but I think we went when sea weed is it's worse.... it's a crap shoot anywhere though.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Not a lot of swimming areas and a lot of seaweed at times! If you can go further out into the ocean it is amazing for swimming!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Clean beach cleaned every day in the morning and during the day. Animators dressed up as Superman with bandages a cave man :)
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Clean well cared for beach. it is long wide and beautiful. they have lots of huts and lots of chairs. life guard is on site watching your every move. clean fine sand under your feet with nice warm water from the ocean...beach at its best
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Very nice beach with a great breeze to keep you a little cool. Only downside is the amount of weeds that get washed up.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Depending on the resort you could have a dreamy sifted and combed white sand beachfront or a littered beach-head in the public areas...but no matter where you are on the Bavaro coastline the beach scene is just staggeringly beautiful to behold! Be sure to pack a camera and tripod for long walk photo ops. Cheers and enjoy!!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,We went horseback riding on this beach and it was gorgeous filled with a mix of locals as well as tourists from all over the world.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Loveddd it even though the waves were so strong and threw me away lol had a great relaxing time here.. also check out the activities they have available very fun
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Just would like to thank Joselo Ramirez at the Gran Bahia Prinicipe Bavaro! He is a bartender at the main lobby and is a gentleman! Very accomadating and extremely nice. Please go see him. you won't be disappointed!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,White sand clear water very clean. However watch out for the ledge rocks in the water. Stubbed my toe several times
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Very nice beach & waves. A lot of people but didn't seem crowded as you could always walk and / or find someplace to sit and rest. Bars on the beach too - nice !
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Not much to report beyond what my title states. Weather conditions were not favorable for swimming snorkeling or surfing. The multitude of vendors also discouraged any possible thought of spending any time relaxing or walking the beach. I consider it a wasted trip.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,There is a reef off-shore so there aren't any scary currents. Off to the right (facing the water) is a long row of huts selling all kinds of things; watch out the sellers are kinda pushy...
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Very crowded. Hard to find a chair. Water was pretty rough.It was clean and very pretty. People get there early to put dow a towel so you cant get a chair
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Soft white sands turquoise water... Because we were there in October the water was a little rough from the coming storm. Beautiful totally relaxing.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Miles of soft beautiful white sands and a lovely blue sea. Approach to the sea is nice not rocky although when we went the sea was pretty rough. Not too much marine life close to shore.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,One of the nicest beaches you could expect to find anywhere in the carribean. It had plenty of shaded areas. There were bathrooms and bars near to beach
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Such a gorgeous clean and relaxing water we had a blast at this beach very very very nice. Outta all the carribbean waters this is definitely one of the best
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,We loved the variety and the ability to do nothing or everything! You can"t beat the extent of the complex and the security that protects the guests!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Its so Windy that the lifeguards wont let you go past your knees into the ocean. All you hear all day long sitting on the beach is the guards blowing their whistle to tell people to come back in. And they are literally not past their knees into the water!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,it was lovely beach and maybe be abit of sea weed as i have seen on here people moan about it but it's still lovely and they clean it all the time.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Most exciting and fun filled experience where one can swim with the dolphins and touch them and kiss them on the lips and play with them
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beach is huge - great depth from water's edge to start of trees. The sand is soft without pieces of shells. Water is pretty not totally clear but turquoise and nice.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Great beach a little windy for us but enjoyable plenty to do there is even food and drinks available on the beach
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,extremely clean sand clear waters - views for miles - miles & miles to walk and enjoy down the beach
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,We had a lot of fun playing in the nice waves.The sand is white and fun to touch! Pour faire des chateaux avec les enfants c'était parfait!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,What I did not like was that we were there when Sandy was passing close to Florida and for the first time in all of our visit there were waves and rip tides. Who would think of hurricanes at the end of October!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,could walk at least 5 miles in both directions. beautiful sand and easy to walk on. Were a few panhandlers trying to sell cigars etc. but not too pushy
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,We liked everything about the Bavaro beach the beach was very clean and the vendors don't bother you at all We would love to go back soon!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Loved the sandy white beaches and blue water. The waters were calm while I was there and not a lot of seaweed either.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The sand was white with little pink flecks and very very soft. I highly recommend this area. Natives are super friendly although you will likely be approached to buy something from them.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,dont pay full price !!! pay only 1/5 of the initial price !!! the necklaces i got they said 3$ each i ended up getting 10 for 5$ !! never pay what they ask they overcharge you !!!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beach and water was so clean. THey raked and ane cleaned the sand every morning. Surf not too rough for walking in the water.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,very good beach sand was alway fresh and it was a fine sand very soft not so crowed depending on where you stay we stay at the Riu Palace Bavaro fairly new
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,beautiful beach and tranquil waters this resort was in prime location. The open restaurant was right on the beach.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Water was exquisite shades of turquoise beneath a brilliant blue sky. Temperature was warm yet soothing. Sand powdery white and so soft.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beach was amazing. The water was clear & the sand so soft!! It was so clear & we swam for hours in the ocean!!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Long stretch of white clean sandy beach clear blue water and you can snorkell without swimming out too far and see just as much without having to pay to go out on a snorkelling trip.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beach was full of weeds and ocean was as well. They had markers so you did not go out too far. Sand was fine and white.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,I've returned time and again to this area because of the palm trees that line the beaches - they provide such a tropical feel. Truly believe this is one of the prettiest beaches in the Carri bean Love the feel of the sand between my toes!.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The sand was white and soft. A bit of algae washed up on shore and in the sea. Other than that the beach area was very good. The sea is a bit rough with big waves.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The seaweeds make it feel as if something is crawling on you. It is not as the picture shows. Otherwise the beach is very nice.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,very clean beach with no shells or debrie to step on. Not a great beach for kids. ie lots of topless sun bathing and thongs. Party atmosphere not great for families
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beautiful beach. The only downfall was that there were lots of vendors trying to sell you things but they were all very nice.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The ocean temperature was very inviting. Although there was too much seaweed in water and the beach was too narrow for the amount of people on it.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,This beach is beautiful. White sand clear warm water. Never a time when you couldnt find a spot to sit. Ample chairs scenic and breathtaking.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,We loved the beach the white sand and of course the warm clear ocean. Enjoyed the variety buffet restaurants.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,We travelled here after chosing the Dune Buggy excursion. I was not expecting to see so much in one trip. The views of the distant moutains the friendly locals who offered tourist items and the Dune Buggy excursion (in general) was sooo much fun!!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beach is awesome. White sand and blue water (yes on the Atlantic). Go early to grab an lounge and hut.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Bavaro Beach was a beautiful beach. The beach spanned several resorts and was great for long walks. One downside of the beach was the amount of people trying to get you to go to their shops to buy things. Simply say no thanks and keep enjoying the beautiful beach.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The Majestic has the best part of the beach...plenty of room plenty of huts great beach servers...spent 4 hours walking the beach and the Majestic clearly has the best set up
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,It was a beautiful white sand beach plenty of water sports available plus they gave us a lesson on the hoby cat then we took it out for an hour. Great fun!!!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,good but to many stores and that takes your time from having fun some times you have fun looking at things that cost 2 times more then in Canada
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Super soft sand. Ocean floor was extremely smooth. Didn't care for vendors. I like to look at my leisure & not having someone showing me things
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,I love beaches that are so crysta clear you can see your feet at the bottom. THe entire beach area is clean.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Warm waters did have a bit of seaweed. The week we stayed the waters were a bit rough so pay attention to potential under tow.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,All tours left on time. Make sure to pay extra for the premium club. You have access to all the top restaurants in the establishment and get treated as royalty when they see your wristband.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Perfect beach but too many people trying to get you to buy stuff or go parasailing. Abit of seaweed but its an ocean. Cant wait to go back again.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Each Hotel should have a sign or flag identifying themselves so you know as you walk down the endless beautiful beach. I did not like the hotel 'reps' on the beach pestering you to come in and check out their hotel while you walk down the beach they were more bother than the peddlers.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The water and beach were clean. Soft sand and gentle surf; no undertow. Great for kids and snorkeling.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Clear warm waters. Always calm The only suggestion I have is that they sweep the seaweed out a few days...
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beautiful clear blue waters and sandy Beach. Palm trees and the sun longers make the beach look very picturesque!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Nice beach beautiful sand goes on for a long way with lots of little shops along the way to stop and see every ones wares
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beach near our resort (Bavaro Princess) was gorgeous but a close walk to the north showed us that there were weeds and beach erosion going on at some of the neighbouring resorts. One even had a huge amount of sand bags all along their beach. Would be totally disappointed if I ended up staying at those other resorts.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,You can spent hours at this beach only problem is that most of the parts belong to big hotel complexes so it may not so easy to find a place where you can stay at when not staying at this expensive hotels.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Very nice!!!a most see in RD..... ..........The road are not super great but it add to the appeal to the this mystic journey.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Very busy beach but also quite good.Lots of stuff to do and watch. Lots of local vendors. White pristine sands.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beach is exceptionally clean and is cleaned every morning the water is always a bit choppy so you have to be very careful
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,I nearly drown in the beach right in front of the resort. By the grace of God there were two other woman nearby and they helped pull me out. The undertow is VERY strong. There have been drownings there.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Loved the scenario and blue water nice for swimming. There are vendors set up making sales which we didn't take advantage of. Be sure to take your swimsuit.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,This is one of the nices beaches in the Dominican. Beautiful white sand. Highly recommend it. Great length to go for a long walk..
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Bavaro Beach has fairly rough surf for children. There is a strong current as you go offshore. This is not an area where you can "swim" in the ocean.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Clean beautiful white sand. The resort staff cleans up any seawood that floats in and rearranged all the lounge chairs each evening.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Very clean and well maintained. It just goes on and on. You can walk or run. The seaweed comes in and they clean it up on the spot at least 3 times a day. Maybe more if needed.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,beautiful beach in the Caribbean ocean.Plenty of water activities.You could also do parasailing or take a tour in helicopter.White sand and blue water.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Some dislike all inclusive resorts but they are definately something worth experiencing at least once. This beach has tons of them one better than the next and for a good reason it is a beautiful white sand beach that seems to have no end lined with coconut trees in front of a wonderful sea.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The white sandy beaches otr tiki hut and the water was so immaculate. The paradisus palma real is the best resort in Punta Cana.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Great place to walk in the early morning or sit at sundown. Shame the sea has had to be divided into swimming areas because of all the boats and water sports.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,With all the resorts in a row there's a nice long beach. Beautiful scenic and very little trash if any on the beach. A few people hawking product but not like other resorts we've been to.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,the beach was amazing ........very relaxing .......was beautiful....people were great ......made alot of friends
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Barcelo Bavaro Palace Deluxe is the only place to stay. I went there for my daughter wedding and everything was wonderful The hotel is very clean food is so good and many choices of restaurants with inclusive and fairly priced. The management is very accommodating along with maid service they are to please
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beach blue water sugar white sand and palm trees along the beach. Need I say more. This one of the most pleasant beaches we have ever seen. If you like calm waters to swim in this is the place.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,There can be seaweed at times but mostly it is a lovely beach no hawkers which is a bonus. Great sunbeds and shade outside the Iberostar Punta Cana and Dominicana and you do need shade!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,the water is clear calm warm no shells no waves you can see your feet you can walk the beach about 2 blocks each way
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,never get tired of taking a day off and spending it strolling along the waterfront. stopping at one of the restaraunts for a couple of hours truly beatiful part of the world
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,the more expensive resorts get a better cleaning service...in some areas it was hard to avoid cigarette butts etc
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,We had a few days of sea weed on our beach and one day that was alittle smelly. But they were out there cleaning up the sea weed every day. Still great to float around in.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,the beach was great. pleanty of shade to prevent sun burning. Presidente beers were all over. There was some debris on the shore but overall the water was great . I am ready to go back next year.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,the water was so clean and transparent. tranquile place to be. anyone would enjoy it. Great service by the beach  specially the romantic dinner. I must say that this was only possible through the support of Aracelis del Rosario.She was very attentive and detail-oriented on setting up the romantic dinner.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Seaweed to be expected this time of year fag butts on the beach. Not enough shade or seating for people. Snorkelling we had to go and find other than that pay $100. Water rough.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,A bit rough but I loved the experience and the beach is ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL!! Would definitely visit again.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,One of the best areas of beach lies in front of the Barcelo Bavaro Beach Resort. Walking on the sand is like walking on powder. Sea grass was not evident on this part of the beach.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Water was lumniscent blue clear and warm. Sand was fine as sugar. Morning walks along the beach were superb especially before the crowd arrived.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Nice trip Snubering driving boats and snorkeling! 45 minute ride to and from poor area sad... Mamajuana was strong and we met people from all over the world.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,very nice sand and water the area hotels are nice and pretty much similar from one another food could bea little better but very similar type of food on all resorts
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Warm water with nice waves. Guys walking by giving away coconut drinks. Chairs all over to tan and huts with lay out beds to stay in the shade. Awesome
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The workers kept beach clean of sea weed and other debris. Every morning they were raking and wheelbarrowing the debris so that the beaches were clean. There had been a tropical distubance and the staff worked hard to keep up
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beach was beautiful. Blue blue. The temperature was perfect. You can walk for miles and miles in both directions. Have shops at one end were you can bargain.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Sand like crystals sea so warm and inviting. The cleanliness was amazing. I liked the whole atmosphere and felt completely safe
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,great beaches ideal for sex at night. nobody bothered us. Plenty of shades to have drinks. The shores were a bit dirty. not a big deal. the water was very warm.I certainly encourage any one to go to this resort.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,I have never walked it at night but during the day it is very safe. The is nothing not to like about this beach!!!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Water was clear and it wasnt too crowded. Also like the fact you could see all the different type of fish write by the beach
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Not overly croweded - options available for "adult" and "family" beach areas. Cabanas well kept/maintained. NEGATIVE: Perhaps it was the time of year but htere seemed to be an unusually high amount of sea weed in water and on beach.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Lovely wide white sandy beach but susceptable to seaweed.The sea is a little rough and not suitable for children or disabled people.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The beach is not nice in front of the Majesctic Colonial and you can see a huge boat in front of the hotel very ugly
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Bavaro beach was pristine white sand and warm blue-green water with large palm trees swaying in the breeze. Nice flat bottom and small gentle waves when we were there makes it very nice for swimming and safe for small children.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beautiful Beach that goes on for miles. Stay away from the storefront huts. They are worse then any street peddlers I came across. If you are looking to shop get ready to hackle with them!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,This was my second time having the pleasure to visit Bravo beach I am not what you would call a beach person but this beach is so breathtaking I made a point to walk the beach every evening the sand is like baby powder between your feet and the view is beautiful I can't wait until my next visit.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,the beach was very clean and we never went witout a lounge chairno matter what time we got there and the staff were very friendly and we loved the bbq
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Bavaro Beach is the best beach to go to if your in punta cana....the water is very warm..nice Turquois color..the sand is white and very soft to walk on....the Beach is also kept clean all the time
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,SEAWEED everywhere. Even though you are on vacation you must rise before the crow to map out a seat for the beach or the pool!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,golden sands warm sea perfect for all beach lovers.all water sports catered for.even has shops along the back for the girls to spend hard earned holiday cash lol.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Everything was excellentits more of a couples resort than singles so keep that in mind when you are a single guy or group of single guys going there
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Bavaro beach is absolutly beautiful. You will find a few vendors here and there that will approch you but a simple "no I'm not interested" will send them on their way.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Loved the beach! a little seaweed and rougher at high tide at the end of the day but crystal clear and wonderfully warm!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,This beach is gorgeous! The sand is white and the water is so clear and warm! I could literally see my feet.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Love Bavaro beach! White sandy sand and they have the bluest water!!! Only downside is some resort roped off some part of the beach for their boat operators...
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beach was not calm as it was during the Hurricane season so we could not swim but I enjoyed the coconut water.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beautiful beach very relaxing Snorkeling is great once you find the small reefs with fish. Quite a few starfish and small schools of fish.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beautiful and Clean! Always lounge chairs available and great to have the bar so close by. The water was clean and warm and as far as any seaweed that I kept reading about - not a problem.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beach was great just a lot of seaweed. Water is beautiful. Topless ladies around but nothing over the top.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Lovely Beach the best in the caribbean the sea is the atlantic so can have a strong undercurrent but you can still swim in it  some days there can be slight seaweed but it's not a problem
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The sand was so soft it was like walking on marshmallows. It never got hot. The water was so blue it was beautiful!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Sand did not get hot clean beach good for a long walk sea calm not much seaweed. Lots of sunbeds and shade under palm trees
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,This was a nice beach. The water was just cool enough to be refreshing but not shocking. No shells to cut your feet. Nice waves too. Fun.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,breathtaking beautiful place everything was amazing nothing bad to say weather always sunny and very hot .Paradise
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,quiet and clean beds always available not far from beach restaurants toilets and shower very clean nothing to dislike.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Gorgeous beach sea a little rough at times. plenty of loungers and cocktail bars to break up the walk
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Whenever you are planning a trip in the Dominican Republic you should definitely choose Bavaro Beach. You will find here the bounty-look they all talk about. Tip: you can't book a beach chair but if you let some stuff on it by night people will know...
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,If you walk south past the results you will find a palm tree lined secluded beach that is photographed for post cards and posters
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,the beach is brilliant and clean would go there again tomorrow! there wasn't to many people on it which gives you space to chill out or have a nice swim without everyone really close to you
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The resort did a good job cleaning the seaweed that washed up to shore but it was a lot of seaweed in the water. I don't like the feelingbut if you don't mind swim away.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Prettiest water I've ever seen in the Atlantic Ocean. Gorgeous crystal clear light green water soft sugary white sand. Waves were perfect for floating or boogie boarding. One of the prettiest beaches I've ever had the pleasure of swimming and playing in.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Awesome beach well maintained with plenty of sun beds. The drinks were within easy walking distance and so were the beach restraurants.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,clean tidy and golden sand. with plenty of plam trees for shade. sea aqua blue. what more can i say....
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Very clear and warm water. Lovely no sight of jellyfish. Only a little seaweed. We went para-sailing and the view from the sky was beautiful. WE saw an amazingly large star fish. Friendly beach staff that worked at the hotel I'm assuming. Many great natural shade trees as well.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,too much sea weed for my liking so I felt uncomfortable and unsure where my feet woudl land because I dont liek to feel the sea weed but the water was warm. There were showers in a lot of places which was convenient.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Best beaches in the world. We love this areas; the locals are amazing; we felt safe to walk miles along this beach with clear waters passing local eateries resorts vendors bars. Top notch vacation and fabulous beach
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Very nice beach with calm ocean and white sand!! There are many options for beach sports that you can rent. I stayed at Barcelo and it was a good beach location the Meliá hotel is also there.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,white sand wonderful palm trees turquoise water great for swimming sunbathing water sports relaxing... we had fun:)
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Even though the sea is in the Atlantic it was lovely and warm. However there was lots of seaweed at certain times. (although we were there when Hurricane Isaac was approaching so it may have been due to this?)
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Speedboat is a lot of fun. The out boarder engine got 30 HP ...enough for having a blast. I've purchased the DVD for US-$ 35.00 and watched myself "Snuba"- diving. The combi package costs US-$ 135.00
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,We stayed at Barcelona Bavaro Beach adults only. The beach was clean and gorgeous. Lots of seaweed in the water but not enough to keep me out.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,so many things to do. their was dancingwatersportsbeach volleyball and lots to drink. its an all inclusive resort with a night club and casino
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,part of a four wheeling tour you are suppose to be able to stay there and swim...but somehow we got to look at vendors and then we had to leave. The beach was beautiful and crisp just wish we could have enjoyed it
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,The Staying at the Barcelo Beach was great the food was great the room super clean and organize pools and water atraction very well take care love the show super entertaining and very interest it for the whole family. I will go back with my family agin. the Bell man Sosa gave us the best services evert.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,It was so relaxing and serene! The only thing I wish they had was meal service to the beach instead of having to get up all the time to order drinks.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beautiful Beach bit of a wait for the waiter to get to you on the beach but overall great beach. Plenty of unharmful sea life to explore and take in.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,It was great to see a clean beach with no rubbish in the sand. I completely relaxed in the beaches while I was getting a perfect tan. Congratulations to all the people who work for keeping the beach clean!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Beach was awesome and clean. Beverages were available close as were restrooms. Will visit this beach again!
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,had a great time just wish they could have gave us more video time we payed 50 dollars thinking it would be just us but we payed to see more of others than ourselves a lot more. I want to say to african americans Go On Vacation.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,powder white sandalways kept clean and tidy.Lots to do with all the actividy the resort has to offer.some topless nudity.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,As previously mentioned take care if you like walking in the evenings seaweed could be a problem but groundsmen were out early clearing it so u hardly noticedhaggle with the vendors they sell at silly amounts.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Love it!!! Spend a whole day working on my sun tan. Unforgettable. I don't like the "Vendors" @ the beach pushing you to buy.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Everything was excellent. Loved our 2 weeks stay. The food was good the people who work at this resort are great. Can't wait to go back.
g147293,d215733,February 8 2016,Did the Bavaro Splash with snuba snorkel and the speedboats! Awesome good time! Staff was wonderful super friendly and helpful for us who had never done that before. Were fun energetic and great! Only a half day trip so didn't take up your whole day and was FUN! highly recommend!

g147293,d215733,March 8 2016,Beautiful - paradise on earth highly recommend a visit Sand was like icing sugar it was so soft. Crystal clear water - heaven
g147293,d215733,March 8 2016,Typical carribean beach white sand and clear blue water. Beach is mostly claimed by resorts. Not really suitable for snorkling though.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,We stopped at this beach on our day excursion it was beautiful and the bathrooms were very nice! They had kite surfing right next to the beach if we had more time I would have loved to do that!
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,The different shades of blue are amazing. There are sections with a lot of seaweed but the workers clean it up daily. There are plenty of spots to relax in the water without being touched by seaweed. Overall fairly calm waters only slight waves when boats pass by.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Stayed here briefly with friends and has stunning beach and clear waters. Paradise personified. Loved it.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Spend some quality time with the family and enjoy the nice clean sand and water. Beatiful place to take some pictures and relax with the wonderful weather we experience.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,great room great service....poor delivery on so-called Premium Club amenities (lack of a good selection of international drinks such as only one domestic beer without an added charge and no scotch without an added charge)...a dismall premiium lounge with nothing in it to attract.....definitely not worth the extra money...food at buffet sub-par..beach nice but very weedy
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Beach was magnificent! Clear blue water soft clean beach. No shells minimal seaweed and debris. Water was calm and warm. Weather was great in January.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Amazing beach. Always some seaweed but staff works everyday to clean beaches. Not much to see snorkeling but sand is like carpet.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Great place to spend the day. View from the beach is beautiful the water colour is incredible. Great place to catch some nice waves. Only down side is the venders constantly hassling you to purchase their stuff.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Everyone was very courteous reliable and resourceful. Room and public spaces were beautiful and clean. Great food.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Very nice !! Long nice walk beautiful white sand !! Beach activities parasailing banana boat deep sea fishing  drinking 😝
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,beach was decent just alot of seeweed workers tried to clean it up but it just kept coming back currents werent bad ; beautiful water
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,The beach had all the componets of a perfect beach in paradise. Palm trees on the beach white sand and blue water. This beach had coral reefs just offshore to both protect you from the surf and provide snorkeling opportunities. Perfect
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Punta Cana is a resort destination so expect a beach that will live up to your expectations but in season it is a bit crowded if you don't care then you will enjoy the people watching. There are vendors all along the beach to enjoy renting equipment for water sports and plenty of waiters to bring you drinks.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,well they barefoot grill was good and the water was nice and cold and the sand was not that hot and it was nice and quiet to read a book or just play with the kids volley ball
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,If you don't mind a busy beach this is fine. Personally I preferred Macao quieter and far fewer people trying to sell tacky souveniers!
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,The sand is fine and pinkish white. The palopas and beach chairs on our beach began to feel like our own perfect living room (I wish!). The water was beautiful and snorkeling off the beach we could even see a few fish near some coral and there was always great people watching! I wish we could move there!
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,last day of our trip we took a half hour helicopter ride and discovered Bavaro Beach from the air. must have been 20 miles of white sand one resort right next to the other. phenomenal
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Long beach great for walking and people watching. There is a old ship out in the water that hit shore many years ago. This is a topless beach That was different.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,White sand  palm trees comfortable sunbeds  drink on tap and snack bar on beach all inclusive !Paragliding people do go up and down the beach daily but if you don't want it they are fine and don't hassle you.They love to chat about England and think we are very lucky to live here !
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,I liked lots of water sports available from the shore right by the hotel. I did not like the seaweed at the shoreline!
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,We loved being in the ocean. The water was mesmerizing and we could really spend time with each other in the water.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Bavaro Splash was the best....snuba diving snorkeling and speed boats were a completely the best time ever
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Very clean waters but rough surf.....Beach is cleaned daily. Lots of sun. Don't wear your expensive sun glasses in water because you WILL loose them.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,like sardines on the beach lots of seeweed u will be lucky 2 get a sunbed. people dont leave u alone trying 2 sell u trips photos etc
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Just average beach. Nothing special. Water was clean and pretty warm. Beach was clean but little crowded.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,"Be Live Punta Cana" one of the best confort hotels in the areadrinksmaid Service good price and sercive they give moore our you paid thank OrlandoJonatan at the Front Desk an Mrs. Pollantis Good Job See you next Time
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Loved the beach but unfortunately there was seaweed during our staybut for the most part we were able to enjoy.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,The sand is beautiful and the sea is simply a gorgeous turquoise. The sand is perfect for sand sculptures. There's lots of actifivities like parasailing and many other excursions and festivities. Along the beach there are several nice restaurants and beach bars that are very reasonable in price considering their prime location.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Sand is clean and white. At Palma Real the were no vendors aloud on the private beach section of the resort.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,The beach has seaweed stuff washed up but it didn't bug me like it bugged other people. The sand was still perfect the water was a nice temp and i loved it!!
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,A natural swimming pool in the ocean! So serene and lovely!!! Calm waters and beautiful palm trees. We visited this beach while on the catamaran excursion. We brought our babies in the water. It was so much fun!
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,beautiful in every way the sand is white and pure and the ocean is clear and blue. there so many things to do and everyone is very helpful
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Lovely blue waters but not good for snorkeling as the Atlantic is a bit rough. I'm a weak swimmer so unable to comment but good for wave jumping.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Hard to swim with all the weeds. They have a truck that comes around the shore line and picks up all the weeds every day. It was a 5 man crew so you can imagine all the weeds!
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,The beach was fantastic beautifully clear calm waters and clean sand. Water sports were good and staff were very friendly( those that could understand english!!)
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,We stayed at Barcelo Bavaro Palace Deluxe and it was on Bavaro Beach. It was a beautiful beach having clear turqouise water. At our area there was a lot of seaweed on the beach though. The water was around room temperature and it was beautiful.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,

g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,The beach in front of the Iberostar Grand Bavaro couldn't be better! Warm water soft sand etc! Enjoy!
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,This beach is beautiful. The sand is so soft and the water is so clear and blue. I have never seen anything like this before. I loved it. Wonderful and worth it.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Same as most beaches on the island. Locals constantly harassing you to buy things from them beautiful water beautiful sand fat ugly people topless.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,it was a great beach.. amazing water.. can not go wrong.. we will be back. On a hot day the water is warm like amzingly warm.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,The Bavaro Beach area is very large and picturesque. Pros: Large beach very clean beautiful water Cons: Lots of seaweed due to the climate area
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Crystal clear water walk for miles great snorkeling just east. The all inclusive resorts are superb you can pick and choose what type of activities you like and then pick a resort!
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,White sand great sun. A fun time in the sand under the sun! It's amazing how clean the beach is always and the attention that guests receive from the employes in the beach area is amazing as in all the hotel as well.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,I liked everything and thinking of returning next year. The food by the beach ( BBQ) at night was an amazing idea.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Swimming in too much algae was creepy! The water was warm nice soft sand but I have seen better. There were too many vendors at the beach made it difficult to relax!
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,The ocean was beautiful but a bit rough--waves. I don't encourage small children to swim far could be dangerous. This is great for surfers and jet ski-ers.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,The beach is clean no shells to cut your feet with gradual deepening of water. Reef is about 3/4 mile offshore making heavier offshore weather not a problem near the beach.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Lots and lots of seaweed in ocean and on beach... yuck!! Not alot of folks on beach but I think it had to due with the seaweed. I guess everyone was in the pool. Maybe is was also due to the lack of beach towels?? BAD VACATION...
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,White sand fine water refreshing great huts from sun getaway. Waitresses take your orders for drinks very relaxing time.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,The ocean and beach was full of seaweed. The ocean was not be beautiful turquoise caribbean waters I am used too!
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Crystal clear warm water. White sandy beach. Lot's of palm trees. No one bothered you to buy things.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Beach was beautiful and well kept. Staff worked to keep the sea weed off the beach and had activities planned to play on the beach. We enjoyed the non motorized sports that were provided through out resort on the beach.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,beach in front of Melia Caribe is terrific - gentle sloping bottom roped off from boats lots of chaise lounges kept clean workers rake sea grass daily lot of action - parasailing boats etc. Pure paradise
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Have nothing bad to say beautiful beach! speaking with the people staying there none had a bad word to say.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Clean warm beach vendors (if you want them) and a lot of action on the water to watch while you sit and relax. Hard to find a better beach anywhere in my opinion.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,The beach was clean and not crowded.There wree not a lot of vendors and the ones that were there didn't bother you
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,white sands clean great sun and shade at the Majestic Elegance Club area. Excellent service from Maxima at the Pool Bar!
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,- Extremely great in the morning. - Caution: When walking into the ocean (once your feet hit the rocks) the Ocean depth suddenly drop from about 4ft to 5+ft
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Private beach belonging to hotel. Clean with plenty sun beds. Also water sports. Water within my depth
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,I enjoyed the buffet restaurants versus the Ala cart
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Lots of seaweed and rough surf. Windy had to stay by the pools. Just not a really nice beach.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,White sand beach for as far as you could see warm waters big waves lots of fun

g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,I love the water the waves and just relaxing on a beach chair.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,The bus ride was 90 minutes because they stop at several hotels. Ask for a direct bus ride! The reef was dead because so many people have stepped in the coral and killed it. The snuba was very good though.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,My resort was located on this beach. Very clean white sand and crystal clear water. One of the nicest beaches I have ever been to.

g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Really does look like the photos beautiful it always has a little breeze so be very careful not to burn plenty of suntan lotion required. The sand is lovely and soft lots to do in terms of water sports

g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,There are vendors on the beach that will not let you leave. Even to the point with pulling you into there store. May sure your ok with allowing your kids see breast everywhere.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,White sandy beach beautiful palms torquoise water and loved the look of the beach umbrellas!! Only negative was that it was a little too crowded for us. We prefer a less crowded beach. But it's up to the individual.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Great sand and water limited snorkling. Great for sailing but also busy with boats.

g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Long stretches of lovely sandy beaches but the banana boats and paragliding power boats take up too much of the water
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,the beach was clean always warm and shallow. saw plenty of fish
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,It was nice beach but there were too many resorts cluttering the view from the ocean
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,OK if you are in the right area. Nice beach to stroll along the shoreline (with a couple of hundred friends)
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,This clean water & sand made a walk on the beach nice and water sports adventurous!

g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Beach has both shade and sun. Water was warm and sand fine and white. Much nicer than Puerto Vallarta and as good as riveria Maya but Varadero is still number 1
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Great place to walk for hours to swim for hours to people watch for hours. Beware of waves but most hotels have swimming pools anyway.

g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Great sand. One of the best beaches I have ever been on. Some sea grass but not a real issue

g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,White beaches that go on for kilometers! If you walk all the way to the end you can come across an outdoor market selling everything from jewelry to big hand painted canvases. Great temperature but watch out.. the sun is strong! Don't forget your sunscreen!

g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,The beach is just like the one you see on TV and in the travel brochures- powdery sand clear turquoise water- quite calm when we were there. Keep in mind this is the Atlantic Ocean not the Caribbean.

g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,I loved everything about! White powered sand beach and groomed everyday. Crystal clear blue aqua water. No rocks! awesome!
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Bavaro Beach is quite long giving you the opportunity to walk for several miles (or kilometers as the case may be) without interruption.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Everything beautiful the beach the people the attractions . We walk a lot and have a lot of fun.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Pretty but could not walk along and enjoy. Vendors trying to get you to go on excursions or buy something and will not take a simple no for an answer. Ruined the experience. Finally pretended we spoke only German and they left us alone.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Great beach. Soft sand and clear blue waters. Palm trees all over the beach some all the way out to the water. Great for photography.

g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Clear water Soft Sand. Perfect. Not many beaches better than this one.

g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Loved the sand Loved the minimal beach peddlers. Keep in mind I've lived and travelled SE Asia extensively so DR beach peddlers are few and tame in comparison.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Didnt have time to swim as we were on a buggie trip but people need to find an ashtray or garbage can... really!!
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,very white and water was very clear and blue. wasnt as flat as I was hoping for and was rather narrow at points
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,each morning they were cleaning the beach as there is a lot of sea weed it was collected by very hard working guys daily who must of thought it was a never ending task but they always had a smile for us.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,The beach was clean and beautiful the seaweed was cleaned up every morning and wasn't a problem in the water.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,White sandy beach beautiful clear/blue-green water. There is seeweed but they clean it up
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Love the attention and care of the staff. I dislike the idea to come back to work........There is nothing that i dislike about this trip
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,But you will be harassed by all of the Iberostar Activities Coordinators. I assume their performance is evaluated by the attendance of their games workshops classes. So if you are lying by the pool or beach they will ask you repeatedly if you will come to their workshop.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Too many people throwing garbage % things anywere in the beach
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Took a snorkeling/boat trip. We also visited swam with Stingrays and sharts wonderful trip Ocean Adventures booked right in Hotel lobby.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,

g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,The Bavaro beach was amazing nice temperature fine sand. Only minus was the mounds of seaweed in the water and on the beach. This was an issue with the area and may have been time of year.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,How is the ocean water bluer than the pool water? Amazing beach!
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,The beach was covered in seaweed. I was very disappointed.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,beautiful white sand beaches and the most wonderful clear blue waters you could ever imagine.No heavy surf just rolling waves .
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Good beach had lots of fun. would not snorkel too far from shore as the power boats and Para-sailing boats are all driven by crazy who dont pay attention very good. There is some seaweed in the surf and it grosses out my wife but I dont mind. The water is refreshing and clear.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,It's a beautiful place to spend days resting and having a Nice time!!
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,It wasn't as clear as cozumel and there was a fair amount of seaweed but it really was still amazing to swim in.

g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,The beach would have been perfect if the staff would have cleaned up after the storm like all the otehr resorts

g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Bavaro beach is miles of white powdery sand sparkling  blue water and full of activities. The beach is racked every of seaweed every day. Vendors do walk the beach selling their items but aren't to pushy.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,January tends to be pretty windy so if you like flat waterit's not the time to visit.Seaweed in clumps but not as bad as some reviews said.Water is warm though.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Clean clear  bright blue waters. Palms trees along the beach walk areas. Builders are not allowed to build anything higher than the highest palm tree so no High rise style resorts
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,The beach is great but the off-resort areas are pretty hectic. Lots of activities going on with lots of people. The sand and water are beautiful.

g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,The beach is amazing. There is nothing to dislike about it. It's crystal clear beatifullly turquoise and blue colors the sand is like sugar and it's extremely clean. The only suggestion I can make is get a palapa early or you won't get one at all.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,The sand was so soft and pillowy not hot to walk on
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,beach is clean and well maintained by the staff with little surf.

g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,there is nothing to dislike if you remember that you are on vacation and that tomorrow is another. Who cares if you did not get that chair - it will be there tomorrow
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,I liked most the color of sea of course) And i did not liked too much of algae on beach but i guess its just was a season for them.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,nice warm water sandy bottom you can walk forever in the Ocean which we did one hot day it s reall nice
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,The beach was kept clean and the water is pristine! There was loungers everywhere. I dont mind dogs so the strays that seldom wandered were welcomed by me. The sand is white and the water crystal blue.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,The wind/waves usually died down in the afternoon and we could walk on the beautiful fairly flat hard sand forever! Swimming could be better though as the water gets quite churned up by all the boat activity.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,swimming with the fish the waves were great abit of seaweed but nothing too serious not being bothered by venders on thebeach was great
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,My gilfriend and i went there 4 months ago. Had a blast. It is the perfect hotel for couples.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Well kept beautiful blue water and wait staff was awesome!
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,This is an awesome Caribbean beach with light fine yellow sand blue sea and palm trees. You can walk for kilometres and enjoy the ever changing shades of the sea.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,I did not feel safe the way the rooms were located without anyone outside to help you out. Most everyone spoke Spanish and it was very difficult to make myself understood. A dangerous incident occurred which was reported I would not go back
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,The beach is a soft sandy white and continues in the water. No need for water shoes here. Water was warm and little wavier than some. Headup: boats rip along here pretty quick so do not advise trying to snorkel here.Better to take a tour if this is something you enjoy.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,One of teh most beautiful beaches we have visited.

g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,The sand on the beach was beautiful and white for as far as you could see. A joy to walk. The ocean was very inviting and really nice to look at. You have to be careful of stones or rocks every so often but we had great fun
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Food was not great. Room was not very clean or renovated. Beach was magnificent. Staff was friendly. There was no evening entertainment.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,The beach was perfect - make sure to get some bread from the restaurant - go in the water maybe about 5 feet in and then throw some breadcrumbs - hundreds of fish appear out on nowhere to feast!
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,beach was way too crowded. just too many people using too small an area.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,The beach here is awesome and very clean we walked down to other resorts and found some parts of the beaches at other resorts weren't very clean

g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Only little thing that we didn't like was that it was spring break..............lots of teenagers {kind of loud} They hung out in the lobby to wait for disco to open so service wasn't great. Maybe hotel should open disco earlier than 11 during spring break.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Beautiful white sand great place to get some sun and fun.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Heavy undertow at tides though. Watch small children!
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Beautiful sand the only negative we had to share with the masses.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,The staff at the resorts along this gorgeous stretch of beach do a wonderful job of keeping the area clean and safe. White sand and turquoise water is picture perfect!
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Beautiful!!!! just Beautiful!!! the sand is so white and the turquoise water... no waves... several restaurants on the beach. I loved it

g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,An intelligent man craves variety so a trip to Bavaro beach is a natural diversion from the norm. With a local flavor and merchants more than willing to practice their English skills many an interesting conversation can be had. You may appreciate the local stories and colors.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Seems like it goes on forever. White sand and turquoise water.

g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,beach could have been cleaner. Quite alot of cups and straws laying around. People should clean up their stuff when they leave the beach and not expect others to do it for them. Be Responsible
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Walked the beach morning and night. Enjoyed the resort section during the day some seaweed in the water but there had been some storms the first day. Regardless it was incredibly beautiful.

g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Would have liked more beach. Although there are palm trees for shade too.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,One of the most beautiful beaches I've ever visited! White sand bright turquoise blue water and a gentle slope with a pleasant breeze made it fabulous. Our area of beach was very clean and although there are the expected locals selling their wares just politely tell them no and they continue on their way.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,What's not to love? Beach is wide soft white sand and you can walk for miles in any direction. Best draw to Punta Cana IMHO. See it for yourself at least once!

g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,The sand was not white.....a lot of roots coming up thru the sand...Pensacola FL beach is prettier

g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Bavaro beach is one of the best beaches ever!!! Super clean blue water with powdery white sand.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Beautiful! Turquoise waters sunny clear skies. what more can u ask for?
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Beautiful soft white sand lined by palm trees. You can walk for an hour in either direction
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,This is the most beautiful beach I have encountered yet on my travels. No vendors to bother you!
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Very clean and well kept great for walking running and people watching! Beware of vendors approaching to sell their wares... prices are 3-4 times what you would pay in town or at a local market.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,The sand was absolutely fantastic. Soft and smooth but the swimming area in front of our resort was steep and roped off to prevent people from going to far out.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Soft white sand and beautiful water paradise for the beach goer!
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,This is a beautiful white sand beach where you can walk for miles and there are shops along the way and little restaurants where you can stop and eat or have a cold beverage.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,very spacious seating wide beach and great for taking nice long walks
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Very fine beach sand and windy every day translates to being sand blasted all day at the beach. Limited shaded area by the beach so prepair to bake if your going to make a day of it at the beach. I had a base tan and still got burnt.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Just the best beach in the worlda must to walk. The water is just so warm.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,The colors of the see with all degradees was very nice. They clean it well early in the morning too.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,The beach is beautiful with fine white sand and bright turquoise water - great for people watching!
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,The gardner staff raked the seaweed and debris off the beaches every morning. We visited other resorts while there and their beaches were not clean like ours was.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,I like everything the pools the beach the restaurant the big parties at the beach at night friendly people the masages the disco all the meals the hospitality. I mean I do have a lot of fun every time I go with my family
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,White sands turquoise blue waters. Gorgeous beach but swim with caution.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Lack of beach merchants a welcome change. Water warm and mostly a gentle surf.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,

g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,I love this beach - miles of beautiful white sand - ideal to walk off a heavy lunch. It's one of the most beautiful beaches I have visited - no rocks to stub your toes no pebbles while paddling. Just lovely soft sand.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Very clear water. Great beach. You can see the little fish under the water.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Bavaro beach and it's waters are absolutely gorgeous. Powdery white and grey sand perfect weather for getting your tan on and people (girl) watching. A+
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,The beach was always well taken care of and always looked nice.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,I was afraid to close my eyes fearing it was all a dream. The water was the most beautiful blue I have ever seen. The sand was soft. Sipped pina coladas and kayaked under the clear blue sky.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,you can walk for mileslots of peoplegreat checking out diffrent resorts on our walks.also buying from beach malls
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,No good snorkeling.Thats it for the bad. Great white talcum-powder sand 28 degree water and moderate surf All the activities you could want and thousands of people having a great time! Vendors are not pushy and offer a wide variety of services and wares. I will always smile when I remember this slice of paradise!
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Beautiful sand and water is absolutely amazing. Loved the fact that the hotel had its own area marked off.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,If you like wandering the beach this is the plae for you. Wide flat and very inviting!
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Great for walking swimming or just laying around. Very wide sandy and spacious.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,there isnt anything about the beach and water itself that we disliked except for the number of people trying to sell you excursions it gets a little tiring after a while
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Clear blue water for miles and miles! The sand is heavenly and the water is very warm too!
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Cleanshadedpossibilities to swim because sheltered by the reef
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Best beaches I have been to. White sand and very clean. I want to go back!
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Loved it especially one the left side with a 15 to 20 mins walk
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Great sand well kept a lot of room never had to get up early to reserve a seat. Plenty of food and beverages within a short walk. The water was georgeous.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,if you tip the beach bar runner you don't even need to get out of your chair.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Beautiful beach we could walk for miles. stopped at a few different hotels that we stayed at previously talked to some of the staff there and was nice they remembered us from other years. AND the week before( we were in walking distance to Iberostar great place to stay..)
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,the beach in front of the iberostar bavaro was the best in my opinion and ther wer far more plam trees
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Beautiful Beach!!!! White sand warm crystal clear water. Our beach was well maintained very clean. It does get very windy. It seems the afternoons are sunnier and calmer than mornings. Very wavey. Fun to swim in.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,beautiful amazing beach. very clean walk for miles
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,No other beach I've been to had so much white sand.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,This beach is wonderful to walk on. Very long big beach and lots of shady areas as well.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,water was a bit cold beautiful tall palm trees to provide shade sand and water gorgeous
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,The beach goes for miles and miles. Beautiful white sand. You can walk on it forever.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Most of the agencies sales their packages mentioning Punta Cana but the Hotel is in Bavaro which is a beautiful beach but not as beautiful as Punta Cana itself.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,The wind doesn't stop and the water is choppy. Even though the water is clear the temp is cold and not very enjoyable
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,We walked far and saw the most beautiful scenery. Some of our pictures look like post cards. It was the most amazing and underdeveloped beach I have ever seen. Cant wait to go back
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Love the water and the beach can't stand the non-stop sales people hassling you. Leave me alone if I want something I will ask. BTW my associate went on one of the catamaran 12 hour trips and was not impressed.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,If you want to go somewhere where the water is blue and the beach is sugar and goes on forever and ever this is the beach for you.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,The grill restaurant.. seafood and steak were great!
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Very interesting but rough ride. It was interesting to see the different processes of making coffee as well as sugar cane. Most enjoyed Macao beach beautiful!!!
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Lovely beach but occasionally littered with cigar buts lime slices and straws. Cleaners do sterling work cleaning up the seaweed washed in by the sea but no one seemed to clean the sand around the sun beds.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,long white stretches of sand in either direction no seaweed palm trees no jellyfish HOT
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Good. Seen a little more of punta cana but again to many people hasseling you to buy something all along the way.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,You will be amazed by the numbers of vacationers on this beach. It is the Sarasota of the Caribbean. Lots to see.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,this was an excellant trip guides were vary knowledgeable.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,there is nothing to dislike loved everything about the resort

g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Would walk on it early in the morning to capture the sunrise. Always a nice breeze.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Great beach white sand blue ocean plenty of chairs and umbrellas for all
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,The beach is gorgeous! You can find many resorts besides and many people walking in the sand.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Aqua waters and white sand! Rarely super calm though
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,expect people to haggle with you on the beach to buy stuff
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,It the most beautiful beach I've ever seen...Been three times!
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Beautiful white sand clear blue waters nice market on beach

g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Walk for miles in white sugar sand beaches! Check out other resorts along the way. Shops located south of Iberostar but walkable from other resorts like Gran Bahia and Rui
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Was a great trip for the day. The waters and the sand are the best ever
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Everything! Staff the resort the food the friendly people who work at the resort the great weather accomodations the casino the shopping and the land trains the grounds are immaculate and Bavaro Beach is way better than any beach I have visited in 15 places in the caribe!
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Clean huge gorgeous you can walk for hours! Gorgeous turquoise water very safe to swim ineven for children.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,We stayed at the Grand Bavaro and the beach was spotless and beautiful. The water had seaweed in several areas but it was easily avoidable and the beach was very enjoyable both for walking swimming and people watching. Highly recommended.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,the bech was nice n fun but u got to run in the morning to have a chair or else your on the ground
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Beach was beautiful soft white sand seaweed on the sand at times was annoying but was removed bt staff through out the day market stands very close to water on the beach were interesting to see vendors were very aggressive which was a turn off. Great walk a long the beach at times it was very windy but still warm
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,this is a gorgeous beach! beautiful on a hot sunny day. take advantage of the catamaran trips to do snorkelling or snuba - you won't be dissapointed.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Plenty of beach for everyone. There are lots of resorts on the beach but we walked for hours and enjoyed seeing people enjoying this beautiful beach.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,What more can be said about a tropical resort? The beaches were well-maintained and manicured. The snorkeling in the area we stayed was very good for a beginner to intermediate level diver.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,powder white with bits of pink. Amazing we just went to Cuba and this beach is way better
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,beautiful and the Barcelo staff kept it very clean!
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,very clean and pretty beach with turquoise well temperatured water not many waves. Pretty windy while we were there (Feb 1 to 14 2012).
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Sand was very fine no shells on the beach water was pretty clear (not like Grand Cayman but it's the Atlantic) not a lot of seaweed either. Loved it and I'm not a beachgoer usually.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,This is a beautiful beach with dreamy palm trees and some of the finest sand you could wish for. The wind however never stops and it intensifies in the afternoon.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Was able to kick back and relax without being hassled by beach vendors.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Beach was very white and clean. Surf had seaweed at times but a quick walk each direction will solve that. Not many shells since its on the atlantic side.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,It was nice beach we went snorkling on a boat trip had nice lunch drinks and lots of sunshine...
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Just miles of sand and clean beaches lovely palm trees all along it makes some great photos. We never got pestered at all by any locals trying to see anything just go and relax.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Came here for a day to get out of the resort but was disappointed with the beach. There was a lot of seaweed and the public beach areas were busy but also the beds were not in great condition.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,My college daughter and I came down her for a quick three night two day escape. It was fabulous! Everyone at the Barcelo was very kind. Michael and Samuel were wonderful on the trapeze try it you'll like it.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,THe ocean is warm and inviting. Most days were perfect a few were pretty blown out but hey your in paradise!!
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,The white sandy beach was beautiful my favourite thing to do on holidays is walk up and down the beach... The waves are crazy on this beach but it just added to the beautiful scenery.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,We visited Bavaro Beach daily during the 9 days we were in the DR this month. The beach is beautiful and the palm trees make it one of the best beaches we have ever visited. A wonderful tropical setting with warm ocean breezes protection from the sun if you desire and warm clear Caribbean water. Who could ask for more?
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Such a beautiful place to be on vacation. The water was a bit rough during our stay but we still swam in it. A little bit of seaweed but not bad.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Amazing Beach white sand fun waves can walk for hours locals set up with booths all in defined areas so if you want to browse you can but if you show interest expect to be solicited fairly often.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Best beaches around. The sand is so soft and fine. Water is clear blue green and the sun is always out. Even if it happens to rain it is fast and still warm.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,I have been to Bavaro at least 10 times. it is an absoutely gorgeous beach. I never get tired of going there and I highly recommend it.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Amazing sand and plenty of room to walk for miles!
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Sand is white powder and not hot. breezy but the surf is not too big so you can float forever. There is very little seaweed and the ocean floor clean. I didn't see any fish at all!
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,very fine sand waves were sometimes high and too much garbage on the beach. they didi remove the sea weed on two occasions.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,White sandy beach waves were not to big. People were very friendly. Make sure you tell your kids about toppless sun bathing. I guess it was a schock to my to daughters at first... but by the 2nd day it was like whale watching... if you know what I mean!
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,beach very nice at the time we went (janurary) lots of seaweed.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Punta Cana airport was a complete disaster!! People were frustrated at lack of direction of staff - 1000 people stuffed like sardines for 1.5 hours. This was our only complaint - not a good way to start or finish a vacation - departures area was the same! Maybe worth flying to another airport & going by bus?
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Nice white soft sand. Great long walks. Sell delicious coconuts right on beach.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Great for your morning walk. Usually clean. They get rid of the sea weed as soon as possible.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Crowed but long and great for people watching and walking
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Gorgeous clean turquoise water and nice sand you can walk forever along the beach

g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,powder sand warmclear beautiful water nothing to dislike about it just wonderful
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Most resorts are on this beach. If not it's worth a visit.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Awesome white sand and crystal clear ocean. Loved surfing the waves!
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,The beach was beautiful and clean. Nobody bothers you and you can just relax. Dominican people seemed happy to help you at any time.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Beautiful & challenging with white clean sandy lengthy beach with easy walking access to other resorts.Further along the beach were plenty of vendors!
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,We thought this was the prettiest beach we had ever seen. The sand was like powder & kept very clean. Palm trees were placed in perfect frame of the beach & ocean.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,sand clean staff very friendly and helpful the artist doing tee shirts did a woderful job painting scenes the water was picture perfect
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Miles of white sand blue-green warm water! What's not to like.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Loved the sand and the warm clear water. You can walk for hours on this beach. Some parts there is seedweed and it just depends on the direction of the current and how strong the waves are. But there are crews cleaning the beach
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,We walked this beach every morning in both directions for miles and miles. Incredibly gorgeous.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,The beach was beautiful.Very clean and lots to do.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,We went to the Bavaro Beach as part of an excursion through Runners. It was beautiful. The water was warm and the waves were so much fun. The area is beautiful. I would love to go back.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Clean.... soft sand great location great for all type of water sports
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,We like the flat nice beach with palm trees for shade plenty of chairs. Some of the group liked the calm shallow waters others did not as they could not really float etc.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,The Beach is the only thing I actually liekd about the Catalonia Royal. The weather was perfect beach very clean and water was perfect shade of blue green. Not enough to get me back to dominican republic
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Beaches along Bavaro are beautiful sandy and clean. no water shoes necessary.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Beware of the booze cruise party boats blasting music and loud parasail boats going back and fourth all day. Otherwise a decent beach. Too bad about the boats through otherwise it would be a nice place to swim out to the less choppy water.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Nice sandy beach. Aside from being hard to walk because the beach is so full of people it's a nice beach.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Vendors at the public beach marketplace are fast-talking hustlers.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,the weather was overcast for a few days and as a result a lot of seaweed and litter was being washed ashore daily. Not as clean as I expected.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,nicest sand and nicest waters. Nothing really to dislike everything was fantastic!
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,beach was fine its a beach got sand and water what am I supposed to say?
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,We walked up and down Bavaro beach. The Paradisus beach area was definately the best. Loved it!
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Too many vendors trying to lure you into buying local basura

g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Beautiful Beac however were bothered by staff members and locals that tried to sell pacjkages and time shares.....
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,The sand is great. But the water was a little cool probably since it is Atlantic Ocean.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,The best on Bavaro beach large and clean! No problem getting chairs and palapas.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Ocean was beautiful waves could be quite large at times there is an pretty strong current as well. Ehere was a nice breeze while at the beach which made it nice. Never got too hot.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,The sand is nice you are able to walk a long way but the beach is very crowded everywhere. All of the resorts keep it clean the water looks clean but rough and may not be an easy swim.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,White sand for miles. Wind in your hair. A spot down the beach to shop and have a beer. What more could a Canadian traveller want!
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Like walking on sugar. Very clean and stretches on forever. Hotel property free from vendors but within walking distance of local shopping.

g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Nothing I disliked it's gorgeous! Just wished it didn't rain 3 days out of 7 so we could have enjoyed everyday on the beach!
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,The beach was private in front of our hotel (Royal Service) and so we were not hassled by timeshare salespeople or any other salespeople.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,The beach was always windy and they never picked up any of the seaweed all the way down the beach all hotels. We walked for 45min and the whole time there was seaweed on the sand.

g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,the beach was very small and it was difficult to walk along the shoreline because of all the seaweed and smallbroken shells and rocks.the weather was beautifulnot to hot with a little bit of wind to make it comfortable.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,The beach was huge and the water was warm. The white sand was so inviting to play in and act like a kid again! loved it out of all the beaches I have been to.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,This beach is where the screensavers are made! The softest and most prettiest sand. The water is warm and the clearest shade of turquoise. No wonder why this is one of the top ten beaches of the world.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,There was way too much wind. You would get sand in your drinks it was cool when you were not in the sun. The beach was not cleaned every day so there was always sea weed on it. There were also a lot of waves.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,We stayed at a resort on this beach and were so pleased with the white sand and clear waters. It is windy but that takes away some of the heat later in the day.

g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,The only but would be that it can get very crowded in front of some of the resorts.You definitely cannot go scuba diving or snorkeling immediately off this beach.But it was great to walk.

g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,The beach is public and covers a lot of area and hotels. The public portions of the beach have lots of people walking the beach. The hotels did a nice job on keeping the hotel portion of the beach reserved for hotel guests. The water is great and the sand is perfect.

g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,This beach is very nice. On the Atlantic ocean with minimal size waves. The beach is very long and can walk to many different hotels. The sand is soft and comfortable on your bare feet.

g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Bavaro beach is really beautiful with white sands and azure water but we had too much grass in the water during our holiday (beginning of July). The hotel staff cleaned the beach every day but it didn´t help.

g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,If you enjoy the sand and sun you will find Bavaro Beach the best of the best.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Beach is nice dont sit near the volleyball nets if you want to relax because balls come flying often! Water was clear and warm lots of palm leave umbrellas for shady areas. Breezy at times.

g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,The Bavaro Beach is beautiful and clean. It is relaxing to walk or just sit and absorb the ocean sounds. I guess you just have to get used to the people. Use sunscreen to avoid a burn!

g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Very nice beach one of the best in Punta Cana. Tip: Stay in a Hotel near this beach as Domenicana or Iberostar Bavaro in this case the beach will be your backyard.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Very long beach with white sand and lots of palm trees. Go early to get a chair under a palapa. Lots of seaweed although employees work hard to clear it all day. No beating Mother nature!
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Beautiful clean beach. The sea is a bit choppy but very safe.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Nicest beach on the coast I think. Plenty of sand warm water and toys to play with.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Miles and miles of clean soft white sand! We walked mostly along the Iberostar area but noted while on a later snorkel trip that if you walked far enough toward the (north?) end the beach was deserted/secluded with nobody around with undeveloped jungle
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Beautiful and excellent swimming! Blue waters and clear
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,La playa es muy bonita pero las tormentas tropicales en Septiembre dejaron muchas plantas y raices de palmeras en la orilla de la playa aun asi nadamos todos los dias en el mar.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,We found it to be gorgeous and we were not harassed at all by vendors.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Went for very long walks on the beach a couple of days - you can walk for hours - beach can be very crowded - but if you go past the resorts the beach is not cleared up so can be a bit shall we say untidy! Breakers can be quite big and there can be a very strong undertow.

g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,The beach was cleaned on a regular basis so the weeds were not a problem

g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Probably the most beautiful beach we have seen. Able to walk for miles
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Awesome beach with vendor village HAGGLE or you'll regret it. No one bugging up every five feet but they are out there I found a simple wave and no thanks worked well.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,too many weeds. Very windy therefore very unpleasant to swim in Ocean.... The weed pile-up was also very smelly after rainy days
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Beach was very choppy. You have to be sure footed if you like to walk on the beach. Very clean beach nicesoft white sand
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Water wasn't the best for swimming most days -- a lot of seaweed and could not see the bottom...
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Large beach palm trees shade and sun water is so beautiful
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,the water was a combination or blues and greens--very pretty! The sand was a light tan and super soft! Great for building sand castles etc.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,We just returned from a wonderful week and the friendliest people. The beaches are clean and the locals are very helpful.....We also loved the THE BEST by FAR was reSTAURANTE LA TAVOLARA. THey made a special vegetarian lasagna for us and the owners are plaza dorado #105 los corales.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,i like the white sand but way to wavy when u get out the water ur full of sand
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Loved the sand and the water....what else can one say about a beach!
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Flourly soft sand clean beach area and spectacular water colour.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,The Bavaro Beach is perfect. White sands and turquoise water. It is very windy in December and if you like to swim or snorkel in the ocean you will need to take a tour to another part of the island or go at a different month -- we were told this is typical December weather.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Could be cleaner saw lots of garbage floating in the water.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,

g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Parasailing speedboats partyboats kayaks Hoby Cats you name it. Unfortunatly therefore it's too busy and crowded to snorkel. Swimming is really only safe in the according swim zones.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Amazing beach. You can't ask for much more than this. Half meter swells are just enough to play around in without being boring
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,If you are looking for a beautiful beach with soft white sand Bavaro Beach offers some of the finest you will see. There are no shortage of good resorts along this pristine stretch of ocean front. Very little sea weed incredibly fine sand that stretches for miles and miles.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,This beach was excellent it was easy to get to and the water was great a lot of water activities if you like to do that. You will not be disappointed.

g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Even in December the water temperature is not too cold to swim in and the endless white beach....the only minor issue was the seaweed.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,But there were way tooo many people! and it was difficulty finding beach chairs
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,The beach is owesome clean always available chairs the water is EXCELLENT

g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,great beach..if you are a guy you need to bring a hat and sunglases so your wife or girl friend will not hit you. The talent is amazing!!!

g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Bavaro Beach streches for miles. It is a great swimming and watersports beach as well as great for walking. Their are many resort hotels for any budget. It is the best location to stay in the Domincan Republic.

g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,What can you say about hotel beach. It's nice but overcrowded. There are lots of beaches in Dominicana less crowded :)
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,WOW. Second only to Veradaro and ahead of Cancun/Mayan Riviera.

g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,It is a beatiful beach with a white sand and tree palms. The water is warm and it is sunny even in Novermber. The clouds come and go as wind moves them through the sky. It is just little bit too crowdy. But otherwise it is the place worth of seeing!

g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,The water is warm and calm like a bathtub Sand is white and fluffy Except for the obnoxious sales persons on the beach was a great outing!

g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,came here during our snuba/speed boat excursion. HIghly recommend going through Bavaro Splash. water had a bunch of seaweed. Other than it was great

g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Lovely swimming area sandy bottom no rocks or shells to step on. There was some seaweed during our stay must have been due to some turbulance out in the ocean. Goood for walking.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Lots of seaweed this time of year. Sands are nice and soft and the water is nice and warm but the seaweed impeded on our ability to enjoy the beach.

g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Nice beach other than the waves. If you don't swim be careful the current can be very powerful. Also the ocean bring in a lot of sea weed.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Bad time of the year. Lots of rough water. Seaweed and cloudy water. Need to keep an eye on the little ones and the elderly as the waves were rough.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,This hotel was a little dated and the staff not as friendly as others. The view and the beaches are very nice.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Beach was stunning cleaned daily. Sunbeds for everyone. The only thing I feel you need to be aware of is that'll I got bitten badly whilst on the beach. Mostly by sand mites so be careful.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,The Ocean is very much in charge on this side of the island. She must be respected at all times especially during high tides.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,

g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,what a wonderful beach so clean and tidy. the water warm and welcoming on very hot days. 5 min walk from all the Riu hotels.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,We stayed at Royalton Punta Cana Casino & Spa which is located on Bavaro Beach. The best way to describe the sand is it is like golden brown sugar. Absolutely gorgeous and "sweet" just not in the edible way. Never been to a beach like it before but will definitely be back!
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,While it is stunning and beautiful there was only one thing that was a pain in the butt. The lack of washrooms. This aside it was great.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Definitely a place to relax incredibly clean. Just beautiful! I especially love it's proximity to the Agora grill and pool. Enjoyed my time here.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Enjoyed the speedboat excursion immensely. The snorkeling was just OK. Didn't do the snuba activity. Staff was very friendly!
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,The water was warm...beach was long and beautiful!! You could go for long walk up and down beach! When you went in water it was sand underneath your feet ! Gorgeous water for miles
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Beautiful endless beach! Clean security monitored lots to do. Reasonable locals so shop and take advantage of the goods and services offered!
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Just another beutiful beach. Not good to swim but a nice place to rest and idle. Worth visiting if you are close.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,People are here from all over the world and tell us they come here for 3-4 weeks at a time. Most feedback from Europeans. I've traveled plenty and this is the prettiest beach I've ever been to crystal clear blue waters with a light gentle constant breeze! Highly recommended!
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,The beach is very beautiful with big waves. There were a few days that the beach had A LOT of seaweed but I think that was more on our resort for not cleaning it up in a timely manor.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Beautiful water but rip tides and minimal swimable water. Long white sandy beach good for walking. Moderate see weed but cleaned up daily by a multitude of resorts.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Beautiful beach and very clean. Water is so clear and clean!! You feel very relaxed. If you don't like to tan there are also fun activities that they offer at some resorts with boats and kayaks
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Clear water relaxing atmosphere great people good resorts. Punta Cana and Bavaro are a paradisiac place in this beautiful island.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Wow what a beautiful beach. This is the perfect spot to get some fun in the sun and in the water! I don't know exactly where on the beach we visited because we were on an excursion but the sand was perfectly white and the water was turquoise and crystal clear!
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Frankly there are so many beautiful peaceful beaches in Punta Cana that I found it unnecessary to go back to Bavaro Beach. It is crowded and the people from the little stores were very pushy even rude! We decided to go to Macao and loved it. Or even Playa Blanca was even better!
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,All you ever wanted in a beach! Fine sand clear waters few seaweed clean perfect for long romantic walks or lounging. Also we saw few of the pesky vendors that are so common on other beaches. Enjoy!
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,White sands and blue clean water a gorgeous beach. Water was very tranquil and warm. What I would give to be back there today!! Watching the sun setting and the palm trees makes a perfect picture.
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,We visited here briefly towards the end of our excursion. It was beautiful!! The sand was white and the water was the perfect temperature. It was quite quiet on the beach which was nice as it felt we had it to ourselves. Good place to visit if you're out and about!
g147293,d215733,March 7 2016,Soft white sand . . . beautiful clear and calm blue water . . . not crowded. No jewelry or shirt salesmen to disturb the tranquil setting. Would highly recommend!
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,Amazing food managing wine service come with no worry. Great experience somilier great food. Service good great resort.
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,Bavaro Beach is absolutely beautiful. Sand is amazing water not too hot not too cold and where we stayed (Barcelo Bavaro Princess Deluxe) it is surrounded by a coral reef so super calm and perfect for young children.
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,Shallow waters clean sands and beautiful palm trees. You can walk down the beach for miles to see the different resorts.
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,Beach is beautiful! Water was warm with no weeds. Clear and sand. You can walk forever in both directions. Large not crowded.
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,Just gorgeous with no litter very well manicured. We walked up and down the beach along the waters edge and saw other resorts watched them play games and watched the water sports.
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,awesome clear water and white sandy clean beaches. free to walk up and dow to see all the ocean front resorts and buy from friendly locals. beautiful area when i stayed at Bahia Principe resort
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,Sea current very strong take extreme care Not any good for snorkelling Gets quite busy at times Go the market
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,A beach lovers dream! Very pretty water seaweed was a little problem. It didn't take away from the day. A must see. The sand feels like sugar. The water is clear.
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,The beach was nice. No pan handlers. Plenty of sun and no dangerous sea life. There was a lot of sea weed there in November and there were small attempts to clean it up and control it with floating barriers.
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,Great white sand beach...we did get a bunch of seaweed wash up on day three but they were trying to clean it up....
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,I spent hours walking this beach daily while on vacation! You can walk for miles! It was well kept - some parts of the beach were slimmer than others but still lots of beach left.. Had no issue with seaweed where we were located.
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,had a great time at the beach...lots of sand and activities. Ocean is clean and the beach well maintained at all the time
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,Stunning beautiful beach and kept very clean and tidy. There were plenty of staff on hand at all times
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,Breathtaking beach Beautiful Hotels Casinos Nightlife everything is there. Perfect place for a getaway without breaking your wallet most of the hotels are all inclusive.
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,Bavaro Beach is simply beautiful. The hotel also offers a lot of activities by the beach so you have the option to soak up the sun or do something fun.
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,We walked every morning on the beach which was one of the best thing to start our day. Walking and exercising was a must in our holidays as well as having the opportunity to meet people
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,Nice beach for relaxation and sunbathing. I would not recommend for swimming however as there are algae in some places and the smell can be strong also. Overall no smell on the beach.
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,The water and view of this beach is amazing however because all the resorts are on this beach walking up and down you will simply find resorts and people from the resort.
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,FUN and full of action - you can walk for miles. Great people watching. Good local shopping. Gotta go when you're in Punta Cana!!
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,The beach was nice white sand but full of seaweed(and I mean FULL) also super windy your towel barely stays on your chair without flying away
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,Awesome beach sand is very fine feel great walking bare foot. Beach is almost 20 kilometers long you can walk as long as you want.
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,Our hotel was on Bavaro beach and the water was super warm and turquoise! One of the best stretches of beach in Punta Cana for sure!
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,I thought that the Punta Cana Bavaro beach water was clean and warmed. The weather did not helped because it was raining most of the time.
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,Beautiful white sand relaxing ocean breeze depending on resort vendors bother you more or less depending on where beach chairs are
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,Great stretch of beach to walk on. Some resorts maintain the beach better than others but it is still a great place for a stroll.
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,waves are a little roughnot suitable for little onessome seaweeds though nothing to worry about.lots of shade if desired.
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,Spent a week in December and loved the beach. Favorite ocean so far.. This is where you can spend two weeks and get everything a beach can bring.
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,This is a lovely beach although I would agree with other comments it's not great for young children as the current is very strong and the waves are big. Unfortunately some people don't feel the need to pick up there rubbish which does ruin some parts. It's a great place to relax have a cocktail.
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,love the water color the sand is so warm and soft. Lots of activity you can do. BUT!!! there are just too much sea weed.
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,My husband and I had a great time.Nice beachcomfortable roomgood employe.We want to thank to Louis who work bellboy or customer service-he is a great guy-
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,This beach is open to the public however the seating for public access is limited. We were able to find beach seating at a restaurant on the beach that served awesome food and drinks. The excursions are the best. You must try the speed boat with the innertube seat and the banana boat. The glassbottom boat is awesome as well.
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,Bavaro Beach by all means is a very pretty beach. The colors are amazing and you can see clearly to the bottom. I was there in June and the water was cool and refreshing. It depend if it had rain the day before we would get some waves...otherwise it would be like a plate (so still and beautiful).
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,This hotel was terrible and that would be putting it kindly. It does not match the overall beauty of Punta Cana. The name in it self suggest Liveliness but my experience was far less than that...
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,We were fortunate to have a private beach in front of our condo. Punta Gorda. Lots of room to ourselves. The seaweed didn't bother me however a few passers by commented that the owners should clean it up.
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,We had a very relaxing vacation Some parts of the beach are very well maintained than the others depends on the resort that you visit Bahia and Iberostar seemed to have a much better beach from compared to Riu and other resorts in the surrounding.
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,Beach is beautiful . Calm ocean breezy beautiful palm trees soft white sand. Beach is kept clean. Weather is ideal . Usually sunny in the morning and it usually rains in the evening or overnight
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,One of my preferred beaches clean water full of activities but not too crowded. We did parasailing pedal boats speed boats
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,Great emerald clear water and fine sandy beach. Lovey for building sand castles or just walking barefoot. Make sure you get a cabana to shade the sun.
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,beautiful and plenty of loungers to enjoy the sights and the sun many amenities available to us speedo's on 60s year old men a bit funny and scary LOL
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,Wonderful day on Bavaro Beach. The white sand blue sky and beautiful turquoise water with waves all combined to create the perfect afternoon.
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,lots of seaweed this is at no fault of the hotels was simply natural done all they could to clear.
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,A clean and peaceful beach white sand blue skies clear water lots of local vendors selling coconuts fried food bikinis hair braids and more...if you are traveling to Punta Cana make an effort to visit Bavaro Beach its worth the hype.
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,I recommended!!! I beatifull beach with white soft sands. A lots of nice and elegant resorts with all inclusive offer. Lots of beach adventures and water motor equipments.
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,We have travelled to quite a few places in the Caribbean...this is absolutely the best beach ever if you like waves! Beautiful white sand clean water lots of palm trees and waves to play in! Bring your boogie board!
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,Clean could walk for a long time water was a tad rough flea market at end of beach had sellers that were a bit pushy lots of palm trees on beachfront of the RIU Palace Bavaro which is where we stayed nice for privacy and shade if desired.
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,be prepared for bigger waves but the most beautiful blue water ever. The sand was white and super soft.
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,Private beach at the edge of the resort. No vendors but after a short walk down the beach we discovered a small market area that displayed the work of local artisans. But be aware some of the sunbathers chose to go top-less and apparently that is acceptable. Teenage boys found it especially interesting!
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,Breezy weather made for some rough surf. We actually chose not to do any watersports because of the waves. Wonderful for sunning though since the breeze kept things cooler.
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,White sand with clear water and the whole beach is very clean. Plenty of sunbeds about and drink huts all over. Dive centre is in the middle with activities on offer. Strong waves but water is quite shallow where people are allowed to swim!
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,Bavaro beach was amazing clean you feel like peace of heaven I enjoyed the sun and the great service Barcelo Bavaro provided. Especially the staff  they are amazing and really makeup my trip
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,Loved this beach very lovely water and sand very good to sit down and relax ! Brilliant fun ! And would love to be there now !
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,Long beautiful white sand beach. The water was rough when we were there and seaweed was being washed up. Most of the hotels had crews out to clean it. We walked about 35 minutes one direction to the market. Beautiful water!
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,Lots of vendors selling miscellaneous items food and pictures with non-native tropical animals. Water was warm and the view was nice. Bring money to rent chairs
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,Beautiful wide beach only drawback is the wind in the winter. Beach peddling is manageable. While more beaches are hopefully yet to be experienced this is second only to the Seven Mile and Bloody Bay beaches of Negril that I have been to. You wont be disappointed.
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,This beach has the finest pebble-free sand I've ever walked on! The area is groomed daily and well maintained. Hotel patrons can enjoy long morning walks and are rarely approached by vendors selling their wares. It's perfect for swimming and body surfing. You can book water sport activities right on the beach.
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,Holy moly the wind was craaaaazy! Not every day but a few of the days I was there in December. The beach is great to walk along and the sand is ridiculously soft and luxurious under your feet
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,The beach is beautiful with white soft sugary sand. The water is warm but there is some seaweed which made me spend more time at the swim-up bar. Also the waves are pretty small which seems consistent with the Caribbean.
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,The beach was absolutely beautiful... Some days there was seaweed but we saw most resorts had employees raking it the entire day. The water was pretty clear and calm. Not rocky at all!
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,Nice long stretch to walk on. Waves are huge and fun to ride. Very packed beach. Get your loungers early! Especially if you want shade.
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,Well kept beautiful beach relaxing vibe tropical heaven would recommend to all close to attractions and shops.
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,Clean idillic and a great place to relax. Well maintained and picture perfect Lots to see and find .... Amazing shells and sea turtles one of the best beaches I've ever seen
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,Too much sea weed. Never got in the water. Beach too small for amount of people. Fenced off and right outside had little huts to buy stuff but so aggressive! Little scary!
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,Great time pricey of course. We all loved it. 3 kids mom and I. Pictures for experience way over priced. Ouch. Everybody very friendly and informed. Facility was immaculate. Would do again.
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,Beautiful and clean beach. The sand is well manicured by the staff. You can also walk up to the bar right next to the water.
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,Spent the day at the beach and looking for condos. Visited approximately 4 new construction site in which models were available to see we also looked looked at condos for sale or resale units. Beautiful area in Punta Cana great restaurants.
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,Bavao beach is a beautiful beach in Punta Cana. Only accessible through the hotels it has white sand (cool to the feet) and a wide beach for long walks.
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,Breathless resort was a wonderful experience. Our host Elvis made the trip truly memorable. The resort was flawless
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,Beautiful beachcreamy white Sands ice blue sea the waves slightly crashing together this beach was my heaven in paradise just lying there the world a million miles awayThe best place to sunbathe and to read a book relaxing that's what we did most days .
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,We stayed at Secrets Royal Beach Punta Cana located on Bavaro Beach. The water is absolutely beautiful Secrets cleans their beach twice a day and it is very clean. The white sand views and plenty of excursions to take if desired. If you visit Bavaro beach consider checking out Secrets or Now Larimar resorts!
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,Clean beach and gorgeous turquoise colored water. The ocean is a little choppy in December but still beautiful.
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,The beaches are so clean and the water is clear and blue. We loved the beach. The sand is soft. It was a great experience. One of the most beautiful beaches from all over the world.
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,White sand. Lots of big hotels and very touristy. Good walking beach. Hard to access unless you go through one of the hotel properties on the beach.
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,Bavaro Beach is a wonderful location for a wedding. It is also a great place for a beach vacation. White sand...ocean breezes and palm trees. What more can one ask for.
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,Just go and chill waiter service is good and efficient although not much English spoken water is to die for when swimming
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,We keep coming back every year to enjoy the sunrise and take long walks. For the first time this year the full moon put on a great show. Lizeta R
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,The water here is breathtaking. This beach is absolute heaven! Calm water crystal clear not too many locals haggling you to buy something - just amazing!
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,We stayed at the RIU PALACE BAVARO on Bavaro Beach. Beautiful beach but with waves compared to the CABEZA DE TORO Beach. Good beach to go to and stay in hotels.
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,Beautiful white soft sandy beach with turquoise sea lovely sea breeze making it much more comfortable for sunbathing than round the pool which does not have a breath of air.
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,Not really sure but the most important thing is that it was so nice to see sun see an sand and proof that you can get a tan even if you stay in the shade
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,The beach is an amazing place to go to spend the day their. But this beach is different. The color is turquoise. You can do activities like going on boats etc. Also there are near by restaurants where you can eat which are great.
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,One of the nicest beaches I've seen in many years. We stayed at the Bavaro Palace Deluxe hotel and had access to a great stretch of private beach.
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,Lovely beach more than enough sun loungers underneath great shade if required. Workers constantly cleaning the seaweed etc from the sea to leave beautiful clear turquoise waters. Bar staff constantly walking around ready to take your drinks orders....
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,Fab beach kept spotlessly clean by the guys every day drink service quite good ( have to tip) no shortage of sunbeds.
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,Bavaro Princess All Suites Resort Spa & Casino - All Inclusive where i was staying had this nice white sandy beach with clear blue warm water. I really enjoyed my stay next to this great beach.
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,The beach used to be lovely but the seaweed has now taken over and it stinks really its not nice visit another beach...
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,The beach has very fine sand and the ocean is easy walk. Seaweed does generally wash up along the beach but it's easy to walk over what's usually a small strip.
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,Gorgeous picturesque beach with many activities available for rent. Riu portion of the beach even had small chunks of old coral reef within the swimming area that provided some neat underwater viewing. Side note: do not reach under those reef chunks; even if you think you see a seashell...it's really an eel with very sharp teeth.
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,Very nice beaches in this area comparable to Montego Bay Jamaica and Aruba. Would return again in the future.
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,Beautiful beaches. Turquoise waters. Some seaweed but it is the ocean after all. Windy the week were there so waters not real clear.
g147293,d215733,March 6 2016,This was our third time to Punta Cana and I must say that the beach is gorgeous...the staff at the resorts in my humble opinion do a pretty good job at clearing the seaweed and you can walk for miles along this lovely stretch of white sand.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Powder sand beach for miles  clean beautiful pictiurous beach easy to walkor even run manyactivity spots for parasailing banana boating water sports
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,The beach walk is powder soft sand and the peek into some of the residences and resort properties are all so different and tropical. Some are restoring from hurricane damage. Be careful by the beach front shops as the beach when the tide is in is mostly water. Visit them thiugh they are nice barter.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Warm white sands and light turquoise waters just a beautiful beach. Sometimes there would be excessive seaweed but would be quickly removed by the staff. This is a beach to go to just relax and then get in the water and repeat as much s possible.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,lots of seaweed coming in from ocean. But its really nice to walk by the beach and away from all hotels.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,This is a fantastic place to take your holidaythe weather is awesomethe people are amazingthe beach and the water is fantasticwe are having a great time. I would strongly recommend that you visit this excellent place. Salut 😎👊
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,A very clean beach. However it has many different divisions according to which hotel on Bavaro Beach you are staying at.

g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Bavaro Beach is truly one of the most beautiful places on earth! There was unfortunately an abundance of seaweed during the time we visited but it didn't detract from the nature beauty. I can't think of a more exotic place to relax with drink in hand.

g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Long shallow beach in a huge cove  plenty of sitting area along beach with loungers . Beach is safe from debris and jellyfish
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Nice beach many people located. Some seaweed strong waves. Lots of amenities for all age groups. The sun is hot so get there early for cabana!
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,although it is known for seaweed and we did have some the staff was good at raking and trying to maintain a clean beach. the sand was beautiful much nicer beach front then other resorts we walked in front of.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Bavaro beach is a large sandy beach along the Atlantic Ocean. It's pretty full of tourists and was suffering from brown sea-weed when we visited in dec 2015. There are a lot of water activities that are easily accessible from Barcelo resort such as wind surfing tube riding sail boats and peddle boats.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Beautiful beach. Turquoise water soft white sand. Gentle to moderate waves and wind make for great Kayaking Kite surfing sail boats.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Views at the beach where nice water was warm and people seemed to enjoy their time. In addition the chance to use a free catamaran or kayak was nice. Didnt do this but would have done this if I had the chance.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,I am a beach fanatic!!!! This didn't disappoint. My only complaint is the amount of seaweed both on the shore and in the ocean. It was a bit overwhelming for me.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Thank u all great service amazing! The food was delicious the staff the place everything was 5/5... Will miss this place crazy xxxx
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Great place. Awesome views. This island is incredible. You will fall in love with this little island. The water is clear and right temperature.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,The beach by our hotel was very nice and kept very clean. The Atlantic side of the DR has a little rougher wave action and quite a bit of seaweed but the beach was very relaxing and enjoyable.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,i am form the Caribbean beaches are beautiful. white sand blue waters and drinks yes welcome to the Caribbean.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Clean and cleaned if weedy. Swimming is comfortable as currents are not strong however no life guard. Birdlife (feathered) spectacular. Take some bananas and mush them in the sea and watch the swarms if fish appear.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,This beach is great go early so that you can get the best chair for the best view. Don't forget to be a camera because the scenery is great
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,We enjoyed our visit. Not a swimming/snorkel spot but good surfing beach. Beware of tourist traps! Locals try to push goods or pictures with monkeys/iguanas for a charge. Wish they took better care of the beach dogs.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,The only reason I would not give this beach a flat out 5 is that they don't clean up the sea weed very often.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Beach had seaweed all over but was very nice. Water was warm. The resort was beautiful. But if you like to leave the resort this is not the place to go. There is a mall with a few bars and rest. And shopping.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,If your looking for a typical sun kissed beach with clear water then look no further. Grab the snorkel and get swimming!
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,I sail a lot from this beach and it is awesome!. The beach is so clean and the sea although sometime there is seaweed around it is soon cleared away by staff every morning is warm and inviting. Lots of beach activities for the younger element and cooking classes also available.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,The beach was accessible through the resort which was a complication in itself however post the hard timeshare sell we were able to enjoy the fantastic beach the excellent cocktails and lounger.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Beach is bit rough at Hard Rock. There are no waste activities but it is beautiful. Walking down the beach the surf calms.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Great facilities great food exceptionally friendly staff would recommend to anyone. The beach was exceptionally nice and the water was beautiful.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,

g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Our beach at our resort in punts Cana Bavaro was stunning nice breezewater can be a bit rough at times but great
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Amazing white sand beach for miles! Highly suggest a visit to this beach. You can relax all day in the sand and clear blue waters of the ocean.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,The Beach is amazing however this year there tends to be more seaweed washed ashore than usual. Each resort is doing their best to remove what they can but in the long run it didn't seem to bother the hundreds of people I seen walking the beach or swimming in the Ocean.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Bavaro Beach is incredible with beautiful white sand and turquoise water inviting you to get in. The beach is very clean thanks to the many workers that keep it pristine. It is wonderful for couples and families alike.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,When you see it you are speechless for a moment. It is a very nice amazing place to see do the sunbathing and swimming in the ocean. Like from a postcard. Palm trees white sand and blue ocean.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Nothing to add great place. The seaweed is not a problem at all. Sometimes a bit dirty but may be once per 7-8 days which is acceptable.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,very clean safe with lifeguards no kinds on the Grand side. Wait staff bring you whatever you want to the beach
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Very beautiful beach very relaxing. The adults only side is very quiet on the family side resort has more people but not loud at all.

g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Really nice beach with beautiful water. Good beach to body surf or boogy board on. Several water sports that can be done on the beach.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Been going here for over 10 years. Nothing compares to the great white sand great turquoise water and fabulous weather (and people). The hotels and clubs are amazing. Try Soles if you really want a great treat.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,This is the beach the resorts sit on. Lots of people lots of coral but still a pretty beach. Great for people watching.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Gorgeous white sand beautiful blue Caribbean waters  soothing wind blowing in your face truly a place to unwind and relax with a good book .
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,We visited Bavaro Beach based on all of the great reviews we had read. The water was beautiful however there was basically no beach. It was full of local vendors selling braids coconuts and massages. Overall a nice afternoon at the beach but just average compared to Juanillo Beach at Cap Cana.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,This is a great stretch of beach to vacation on! We were able to walk for miles in either direction from our resort. It was safe and clean.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,The beach was very nice soft clean sand Beautiful water and waves no rocks or seashells. The beach was the best part of the entire resort
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,We spend 2 weeks walking along coast and bavaro/ambar beach was the nicest. Always being cleaned from weeds every day whole day... clean sand..space divided for swimmers and boats entry. Rescue station. And beautiful views :)
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Nice beach small shared with next door hotel. Good security. Cleaned every morning. Free single beach chairs can get large Cabana's if you get there 7am.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Many people come out early in the morning and tag the good lounges and seats with towels so by the time you get there you have second or third rate options. They should limit non used time to 1 or 2 hours so everyone can enjoy.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,This beach is stunning but crowded due to so many beautiful palm trees beach hut like mini stores and stunning blue-green water.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,The beach is very pretty and it has great photo opportunity. The best time for photos is early morning
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,went snorkeling everyday.waves not to big but just right.not a bad current. really clean.loved it here!!!
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Nice quiet beach with lots of available excursions. I recommend parasailing horseback riding and just taking in the sun.....amazing view....beautiful white sand & blue waters for as far as the eye can see.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,

g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Unfortunately too rough for swimming during our stay in mid-November but absolutely beautiful for a walk.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Superb beachamazing weatherlots of activities to try including parasailing and aquatic sports/boat rides. Fantastic beach front resorts and plenty of off site excursion to distract if the beach "all day thing" wont do for you. A memorable holiday
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Great Beach. There is a constant wind that makes it such lovely weather to just sit or walk the beach. The sand has a smoothness to it. Lovely
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Stayed at a resort on Bavaro Beach and the beach is noticeably eroded its almost like there is a step. im sure it was once a nicer beach....
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Occasionally some seaweed when there is a strong storm but most of the days we were there it was a beautiful white sand beach with just the right amount of waves
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Some seaweed sad but managed I think by hotels who haul it away. There wasn't enough to really bother us and could avoid it the worst day. Other days there was practically NONE
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Loved Bavaro Beach - highly recommend it for the beach lover in you. Note: It can get loud with numerous party boats so you may want to consider travelers with sensitivity to noises.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,I booked at The Reserve at Paradisus Palma Real and the following year at The Reserve at Paradisus Punta Cana. They both have their own beach at Bavaro and the beach is beautiful. White sand and blue water. Clean and relaxing. Not crowded.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,The soft sandy beach is absolutely a must for visitors of DR I would recommend 100% the seaweed cannot be controlled but overall is beautiful
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,

g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,We can't wait to return this year!! The beach was so beautiful - crystal clear and no waves! Morning and evening walks were so serene!
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Beautiful beach. Clear water lots of activities and great people watching. Only downside is most of beach is all-inclusive resort owned the few public areas were not the cleanest or nicest spots to sit or grab a drink.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Third time back to Bavaro. I have to say that my wife and I do a ton of walking on the beach and the Melia resort by far has the best beach front on Bravaro! Love the whole beach tho. Great turquoise water and lots of activities to see and do.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Not sure if i was simply lucky but this was truly the BEST beach I have ever seen (I have not travelled to Turks yet). Crystal clear turquoise water wide strip white sand virtually no seaweed. Simply amazing! Although those who have been to Turks and Caicos say that Bavaro is number 2.

g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Bavaro Beach is flat and very walkable for several miles. It's clean and easy to get into the water. Vendor interruption is minimal and not a problem.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Beautiful and clean beach definitely great to unwind and relieve some stress. My daughter had a great time and to me that's something you cannot put a price on.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,cool beach . a lot of sea weed. a lot of people trying to sell you drugs..but over all its nice pretty beach
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,The water is NOTHING like it shows in the pictures. Bavaro beach is not clear and is nothing like you would expect after looking at the pictures.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,It was nice to not have been bombarded with people selling things. Sure there was an occasional person but they were very polite and with one polite no they moved on.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,9 of us came to this beach in November the sand is soft and white the sea is a glorious colourunfortunately there is a problem with seaweed at one end of beach but there are men working hard everyday to remove itat the other end is a market on stilts selling all the usual souvenirs. A beautiful beach.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,My vacation at Barcelo Bavaro beach is very nice and exciting. One costumer service rep at guess service was very helpful. Belkis LeBron was very professional and friendly. She goes above and beyond to make her costumers happy. I give her a 5 star * * * * * that's how I feel about her service. Bravo Belkis 👌👍
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Beautiful beach but we were disappointed there were absolutely no seashells (we enjoy walking the beach and collecting them). Very fine white sand and if you look closely you could see lots of pink coral crushed up in the sand too. The water was warm with just the right amount of waves.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,I was there in my birth day by my self and was incredible nice people  great service so nice I'm planning to come back in my next birth day
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,I've been here so many times and it never fails. One of the most beautiful beaches I have seen with such nice white sand and the water is always so clear and warm. There can be seaweed at points but really a minor detail. This beach is definitely worth the visit
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Really enjoyed spending time here. The Sand is so white and the water so blue. The Palm trees are all along the coast and so gorgeous. Bring a book.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Second time to this beach and it is just as beautiful as the first time. There can be a lot of seaweed depending on your resort but they work hard to clean it up. Can not wait to go back.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,The best beach in the Caribbean I'm having amazing time beautiful beach excellent whether I'm really have fun I can't wait to come back
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,The water here is warm and clear. The beach is fine white sand. My only complaints are there is a ton of seaweed on the beach at all times! And if you leave the beach area designated for your hotel there are vendors constantly trying to get you to buy their tours.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Beautiful beach! White sand blue water palm trees and a Bahama Mama in your hand. It don't get better than this.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,

g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Lovely beach very relaxing. The nice thing is that locals aren't harassing you to buy items as I've seen on other beaches around the world. Great place to visit!
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,The beach is beautiful. Need to go there as the sun is setting it is stunning. The water is never cold- I thought it would be at this time of year but you can get in without the having to brace yourself for the shock of freezing cold water
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,spectacular view clear blue water. weather is awesome. can't say anything bad about this place. clean beach and nice lounge chairs on the beach to relax on.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Clean. There were workers out raking up the seaweed that would wash up on to the shore. And it was fun. Lots of beach activities always going on -- aerobics games and the like. Water was warm.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Absolutely gorgeous sunset at least the best we could get. The ocean was beautiful a lot of sea grass but probably that time of year and the hotel worked hard to clean it up.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,There was a lot of seaweed on the beach. We did not ever see anyone picking them up. The amount of seaweed was to the extent that we could not enjoy the beach and entering the water.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,This is a postcard beach white sand tall palm trees turquose water. Water is really warm and is a great place to relax and get away.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Beautiful blue turquoise Caribbean beach enjoyed while staying @ Hard Rock Resort & Casino Hotel. Had high current @ the time with seaweed but overall had a great time with (2) other couples. Enjoyed the powdery white sand & the umbrella setup delicious drinks & beer are available as well delish...
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,This beach is beautiful stayed at the hotel royalton where they kept the seaweed cleared. Sunrises are amazing
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,I've visited a few resorts of this stretch of beach and it is beautiful....a MUST SEE. Crystal clear aqua water....Powdery sand....
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,This beach is beautiful and kept very clean. I had a relaxing time at the beach loved the white sand. Only wished there wasn't so much seaweed but oh well its still beautiful.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Sand is like powder. It is so so fine and gorgeous. Small amounts of seaweed but nothing major. The staff removes it.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,White powder sand blue and green waters beautiful palm trees amazing clouds. Staff may cut you coconut from a palm tree next to you you just add local Rum there and listen to the wind and waves.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Took my adult children down for X mas had a great time entertainment food and activitys were all good golf course was a great challenge
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Beware of the beach hustlers they are everywhere then the beach masseuse is great. The water cold the view priceless.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Second time and we will be back again! Beautiful beaches and wonderful staff made our vacation great.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Amazing white sand and blue seas - the beach is kept extremely clean and makes for a beautiful walk.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,This beach is absolutely amazing. It's beautiful and has a lot of Palm trees so if you need to get out of the blazing sun you can. I have never been to a nicer beach in my life! The ocean on this beach is also incredible. I am definitely rating the beach 5/5 stars
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Walked the length of this beautiful sweeping beach it is truly paradise. All the major Punta Cana hotels back off onto this beach with its easy access from every hotel so its easy to pop into other hotels along the way.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,this beach has beautiful white sand. There are coral reefs offshore where there are lots of boats with people snorkeling and diving about a half mile out therefore none of the surf hits the beach and so the water is very clear and calm and is great for swimming.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,This saving grace of our resort was that it was on Bavaria Beach. Great shade on the beach. So picturesque. Fun ocean to play in. Water was perfect for fun!
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,The distance between the palm trees and the water was extremely short (15 - 20 ft.) in some areas. Not what you would expect in the Caribbean. Very disappointing!!
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,The spa was pure heaven the food was plenty and There was always something going on paella barbeque kebab. I made some request to Lucía and she was very nice and always reply promptly and even welcome us upon arrival i was very happy with the stay i will come back again. Our stay was excellent.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Very nice beach whate sand no rocks or anything.If winy weather some seaweeds coming however in the morning it was all clean. Its wide long great for walking both dorections.Palm trees everywhere.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,The place is older and you have to be careful because they employ at least one person that will rip you off. See the full review for greater details.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Spent 4 hours driving around in a boat and never had a bite. I would not recommend this fishing trip. The beach was a local hangout. Not much there
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Since I've seen some "not so great beaches" before I can say that there are beaches that do not get a good review. However this one is clean calm waves and really provides the relaxing beach experience you should have when one pops into your head.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Beach is gorgeous and the sand doesn't get hot!!! There was a storm while we were there but they had clean up crews first thing cleaning up all of the seaweed that had gathered on the beach. The private beaches on the resorts were great!!
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Local vendors that you could bargain with was fun many items to choose from clothes jewelry and gifts.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,All around good destination but must add Punta Espada on your list of golf clubs to play. The Creperie on the beach is a must.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,We visited this beach during an excursion and it was a beautiful place to see. The beach was clean and the local vendors were friendly!
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Beautiful beach beautiful locals and beautiful tourists. You can relax snorkel parasailing speed boat booze cruise or again just relax and enjoy the view of blue water and clear skies with fluffy clouds. Laying on a lounge chair with a nice cold drink in your hand is a great way to just enjoy Dominican Republic.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Beach was lovely calm waves pinkish white sand stunning palm trees and lots of boats. There was a lot of seaweed guess it's going around the Caribbean right now.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,It is a pretty beach with colorful sea views. seaweed constantly being cleaned up and present in shallow part of sea. Beachis slightly slanted so difficult to walk on for long period of time.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Nice place staff could have been friendlier bar service could have been better. Adults only side needed a swim up bar and there was no bar service on the beach and bar service at the pool was hit and miss. Service in the restaurants at night was excellent and food was very good.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Paradise...the palm trees on the soft white sandy beach and the turquoise water makes this beach a good contender to the top place.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Absolutely stunning waters and beaches! A great place to get away for some R&R or even for some fun/social times
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,The water is nice and clean. There is very little seaweed. There are many people keeping the beach area clean. There was no debris. At our hotel there was plenty of seats.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Very positive experience. Clean and ample seating. They keep the seaweed to a minimum and there were very few rocks. The water is clean and there is a nice barrier to keep out unwanted marine life.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Beaches clean and well maintained. Snorkeling and fishing permitted from the beaches if you are so inclined. Lots of beach activities available - parasailing kayak boating rides and pirate ship encounter available.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,nice waves and lots of activity. Plenty of beach to walk up and down the beach. White sand and beautiful blue water. A beautiful beach
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,this is a stunning beach ! white sand  with beautiful aqua blue water! lovely long walks along the beach
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Such a beautiful soft white sand beach with amazing blue and green ocean waters. Small waves and very warm water.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Great beach- long walks I recommend running early in the morning as there are not a lot of people at the beach. One of the best beaches I have been to! Highly recommend it.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Lovely water nice sand and the bar in front of the sunken ship. Great music and great drinks. Totally recommend this spot.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,This is a stunning beach as most are. It is kept quite clean however there are too many merchants who approach you on the beach.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,The sand at that beach was soft and fine. The beach was clean and the water was a beautiful aqua blue.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Maybe because I am from Clearwater FL and I have a beautiful white sandy beach to go to any time I want but this beach had just a bit too much seaweed. The water water beautiful and a nice temp though.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,most amazing beach I've ever been to. water is so clear and warm and I can't help but stay in the ocean for hours. it's so hard to leave the beach
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,The Bavaro beach was a beautiful extensive white sandy stretch that went for miles on gorgeous ocean scenery. Enjoyed many days here.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Great Beach sums it up. White powdery sand clear turquoise sea sea fairly calm and beautiful to wade into for a swim. Everything I would want from a beach in the Caribbean definitely one of the best beaches in the Dominican Republic.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,The beach was nice especially when the sky is blue. Farther down on the adult side there is more seaweed then I would care for but still nice to lay and lounge.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Beautiful beach but the seaweed was so bad you had to walk through two feet of it to get in water. Finally they raked it & we were able to access it & not smell the weeds. Water was warm & inviting. Just weedy.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,We spent an afternoon on this beach just relaxing and no one bothered us the water ws warm and there were lots of places to sit and relax. We would definitely return here upon our return to Bavaro.
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,great beach - some seaweed in some parts - more so after a storm - but nothing to be concerned about really. Our hotel did a good job of collecting it ! Beach and water clean Water Warm Some palm trees and no too busy !
g147293,d215733,March 5 2016,Beach was covered in sea weed. Couldn't get away from it. Waves were very powerful. Not much fun if you can't swim. Someone said its the time of year. Don't know but probably wouldn't go back in October
g147293,d215733,March 4 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 4 2016,Some areas have seaweed some resorts (secrets & now) are good about clearing the seaweed daily. Vendors don't hassle you too much. Parasailing with sea pro was pretty good too seen turtles from the air.
g147293,d215733,March 4 2016,The beach is beautiful. The sand it white. The water is quite clear. There is little algae. Nature here is good. I am not a beach person but if you want to go to a beach it is very nice. Of course you have to avoid the non-stop hawking of garbage trinkets by locals.
g147293,d215733,March 4 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 4 2016,Walk on soft sand surrounded by palm trees when able the ocean offers the ability to see your feet when in water up to your neck; and then catch a wave back to shore.
g147293,d215733,March 4 2016,The people on the beach were always cleaning up the washed up seaweed. They were raking and a machine was going up and down the beach.
g147293,d215733,March 4 2016,Bravo beach is very beautiful unfortunately part of the beach was swept away from a hurricane a few years ago but still what is left is beautiful.
g147293,d215733,March 4 2016,Nice white sand and lovely blue water with a bunch of palm trees !!! I would say that is the best beach in Punta Cana
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,What more could you want from a Caribbean destination? Overall a gorgeous beach just wish DR didn't let vendors sell on the beaches.
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,We enjoyed ourselves and had the best time. Juan the bartender at the Adults only bar was awesome. He was super friendly and fun. Thanks
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,The beach at the Royalton resort (shared with memories) had no seaweed at all. Unlike the reviews of other resorts saying there was lots of seaweed there was none to deal with here! Definitely a huge plus! Thanks Memories / Royalton for your hard work!!!!
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,Great beach to hang out for the day - white sand beaches !!! Breathtaking experience . They have guys on the beach selling sunglasses coconuts and its not too packed that its uncomfortable.
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,By far the best hotel I've been to & I've been round the world from all the staff to foodserviceroomsbeach location just heaven NO NEED TO SAY ANYMORE
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,beautiful water if you can get past the seaweed...it was very itchy and many people broke out from it
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,Stay at any resort on this beach and you will not be disappointed with the beach! You can walk for miles and enjoy the wonderful water!
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,Fantastic beach with white powdery sand and crystal clear water. For those of you who love the most pristine beaches in the Caribbean this is the beach to visit in the Dominican Republic. Lots of palm trees everywhere easy to find a good shade and relax.
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,This is a public beach however if you do not stay at one of the results you can't really enjoy it. Security is always there and can be very intimidating.
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,Beach site is lovely display very well and beauty. The people was very helpful if they did not know how to speak English they will get some one else who speak English to help.
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,I really loved it here! Cant wait to go back very soon. The water is gorgeous and the Dominican people are so friendly!
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,Beautiful beach for as long as you want to walk :) Great shoreline great for sand castles or a stroll  love to walk it again
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,Great place for family and couples - stayed at many resorts there. Brought my boys down and really enjoyed our vacation. I continue to go back and I've never had a bad experience on Bavaro.
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,Awesome beach with amazing sunser each morning. Sandy with nice warm ocean water. Would recommend. Hotel animation staff do some entertainment. You can play voleball. We had all inclusive bar at the beach too. Water activities available.
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,We loved the beach the sea nice and warm! Obviously a lot of people at the main hotels and the bazaar with local paintings and other souvenirs was nice to visit!!
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,Spent two glorious weeks here great location plenty to do and miles of beach to walk on. Great choice of food in the hotel and the staff couldn't be more helpful
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,This beach have one of the longest shoreline I have seen. There are resorts on the whole shoreline and is not restricted. You walk jog and take a sea taxi when you there. There are also lots of water activities to enjoy.
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,Beach is wide and long great for walks!! Beautiful palm trees on beach with plenty of activity. If you like vendors this is the place
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,I have been on beaches around the world from Pattaya Thailand to Cancun Mexico from Port Douglas Australia to Grand Turks and many beaches in the Caribbean. This beach is the best. Lots of Palms for shade and the sand is perfect not coarse or too fine.
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,This beach was clean and very beautiful. Not too crowded in October. The water is warm and amazing. We didn't have anyone come up to us trying to sell things.
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,This beach was very pretty and so warm like bath water. The only thing I didn't care for was the seaweed I'm not sure if it's always that much or just because of the time of year but all in all very beautiful!
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,The beach was beautiful and kept very clean. Excellent way to spend a day sunbathing. One of the nicest beaches I have been on.
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,This beach is the cleanest beach that I had seen on any resort the staff take pride in their beach it is cleaned and groomed everyday
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,There were some travelers that went topless but overall lovely beach and water. There are areas of rocks that you can't see in the ocean and with the current that can be hard to navigate but if you go into the ocean where there are people standing you should avoid that hazard! loved swimming in the ocean!
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,Love the beach Lots of walking room Tide swing is minimal. Not strong current as waves are broken by reef farther out. Perfect for swimming
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,The Bavaro Beach os one of the most beautiful beaches from the Dominican republic. It is great for families with children couples seniors and everybody. Is clear safe and the sand is not hot even is the air temperature higher than 35 degress celsius. Great for chill out and sunbathing.
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,Beach is nice Strong waves and bartenders Adriano and Estaban were really nice.Drinks were strong and good Waves really hit beach hard
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,Our resort was beautiful and very clean! We only had wifi in lobby but a nice time to get away and relax. The spa and gym were very nice! Food was great restaurants were upscale!
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,Beautiful beach with thousands of palms for miles. Amazing water colors. Calm some days others it can be wave filled. Enjoyed taking long walks and viewing all the resorts.
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,The hotel I stayed at did not have the beautiful blue water pictured and there was a lot of seaweed. Most of the beach seemed to be privately owned.
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,Caribbean perfection! The cleanest and whitest beach that we've ever experienced along with unmatched customer service.......we'll be back! =)
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,The beach was amazing very clean and well kept staff was friendly and accommodating and I felt very safe and comfortable there
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,We went doon bugging and they took us to this beautiful beach where we enjoyed the ocean water and they took pictures and videos of us!
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,Clean beautiful soft sand. Pretty beach. We wore 110 proof sunscreen and still got a tan without the burn.
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,Went in October. Gorgeous white sandy beach stretches for miles with a lot of resorts and a lot of activities such as kayaking snorkeling catamaran tours para-sailing and island excursions . Warm transparent water. Warm air temperature with a slight breeze. Some seaweed which most resorts clean off the beach. When I think of a tropical beach this nails it.
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,A very nice beach. It has the usual sea weed that you find on all beaches in the caribean but the resorts take good care of it.
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,The beach area of the Royalton is fantastic and very romantic. Only a few yards from our accommodation made it very accessible in spite of the heat. Plenty of sunbeds and parasols available.
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,We took a fantastic excursion here to go Snorkeling Speed Boating and Snuba Diving! I had never done anything like this before! It was fantastic
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,just got back from a fantastic two weeks holiday spent here hotel was great food was good couldn't fault anything about it
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,Went in October...beautiful light sand with a pink caste. The water is crystal clear and the beach had very little seaweed. Gorgeous!!!!
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,Beautiful beach along the resorts in Punta Cana with transparent and warm waters. Some activities (kayaking parasail) are also available!
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,It was a beautiful site with the most beautiful beaches of teal and clam waters. The sand is actually white sand and cleaned to keep it that way
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,Great beach and well maintained massive waves and strong current so you dont need to go out far. Once you are past the breaking waves its very relaxing just floating.
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,This beach and the ocean are clean and well attended. They even rake and pick up the seaweed daily by hand beginning in the early morning so that when you come out - you have a clean beach.
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,This beach is one of the most beautiful beaches I have been to. It is very clean and the water is so clear. Perfect for a family vacation
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,Lots of seaweed and the water isn't as clear and blue as other beaches in the Caribbean. Trash bags full of seaweed were left on the beach and smelled when you walked past them.
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,The sand is very white and soft. There was some seaweed on the beach and in the water but nothing like some areas in the Caribbean are experiencing right now.
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,The most beautiful beach I have laid eyes on. White silky sand and blue waters. Very clean and alluring. Vendors on the beach were annoying.

g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,Sand like flour it's amazing. We walked for miles. Waves are a bit high at times so I would worry about very young children however would still recommend.
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,We stayed at Majestic Elegance all inclusive on Bavaro beach. The beach was clean and security was everywhere. We felt very safe to walk for miles and never had any issues. One of the most beautiful beeches we have visited and well worth the trip.
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,A great long white sandy stretch of beach in Punta Cana. The only thing to be careful of when booking a hotel here is that the resorts can tend to be enormous so takes a while to get from the beach to your room (for example).
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,resort is large  clean modern many places to shop free transportation around property childrens activities kiddie pools long clean beach
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,Beach was gorgeous but it was a little too crowded knowing our hotel had a private beach which was awesome!
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,We went in October and the water was beautiful. You might find some seaweed on the beach around this time. We also went in hurricane season but other then lightening and random rains in the night we didn't see anything else.
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,Bavaro is white sandy beach with azul blue waters!!! Great for relaxing swimming snorkeling !!! Was just there last week.....water was a little rougher than usual as there probably was a storm in the area previously... Beautiful!!!
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,The sand was fantastic but be aware of the vendors! Thay are RELENTLESS!!!! Lots of water sports and activities. The beach was never a dull place. Always something happening.
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,Tjis is a beautiful beach people from all over the world walking up and down the shore line. The true essence of the Caribbean
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,The beach has these amazing & inviting colors. Clean & fine sand thats easy to walk on. Water temperature was amazing.. Not too & not too cold.
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,Lovely sandy beach nice clean water like walking into a warm bath plenty of sun beds available but lots of beach sellers
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,This beach was spotless. I have been to the Caribbean 16 times and this beach by far is the best. The water was so blue words can't describe it. You have to see it for yourself
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,beaches are beautiful and secrets keeps them very clean. one storm came thru bringin seaweed however resort had it clean in no time.
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,Beautiful beach although a bit rough at times for swimming lots of vendors selling can be a pain bit overall great
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,On the Atlantic side of the island so it can get quite a lot of sea grass washed up in an on-shore breeze.
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,Very nice beach well maintained and clean. Each resort has cabanas and helpful attendants who are eager to help.
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,First five days beach was phenomenal. Last two days water full of seaweed. Gross. Resort out early in morning with tractor cleaning beach. Result of Hurricane Joaquin?
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,My husband and I did a buggy excursion which included a trip to Macao beach . The beach is gorgeous clear and waves are calm beautiful beach .
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,The Bavaro Beach area is near the town center (Punta Cana beach area is closer to the airport). I found there was plenty to do outside the all inclusives but the beach is wide and very beautiful.
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,This is one the most beautiful beaches we have visited. The water is so clear warm and an unreal blue.
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,Bavaro Beach is absolutley stunning! The white sands and the aqua water make for a relaxing day! This is a must see beach! My fav!
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,Pure white sands palms trees and aqua blue sea. Visited end of September 2015 sea temperature fantastic. Heaven on earth
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,Beautiful beach. Plenty of loungers to enjoy. It is very clean even with the seaweed problem they keep it clean. I spent a lot of my time in the water. I wouldn't go anywhere else when in Punta Cana.
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,This is a beautiful beach. There's some seaweed which is uncontrollable but they do their best to keep it clean.
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,Beautiful beach kept very clean sand can get quite hot when paddling be careful as it drops quite deep not far in. Lots of sun loungers lovely just to relax and watch the world go by.
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,One of the better beaches I've walked along. Try a stroll at dawn - so nice. A little seaweed from time to time but that's what to expect.
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,Excellant beaches white sands paradise !!! Plenty of cabanas if you need the shade Waiter service on the beach is excellant service all day :-)
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,Bavaro beach is a gem! I stayed at Bavaro Palace and I really enjoyed my time there the beach is just perfect.
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,all is perfect beach drink services securites. We are like a paradise during nine days there. thanks
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,Beautiful beach with a calm sea and a nice beach for sunning or walking. We didn't encounter the seaweed during or visit the last two weeks of September 2015 that I see others complaining about. Talked with a few friendly people on the beach and enjoyed ourselves.
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,beautiful white sand service on the beach very very nice gorgeus palm trees no seaweed at all at the last week of settember water perfect temperature not to hot not to cold  some wave but not to big enought to have fun and relax.
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,I'm totally aware that the accumulation of seaweed is a natural occurrence. However the resort should take some initiative to section off certain areas of the beach for it's guests and ensure it remains as clean as possible.
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,We stayed at resort on Bavaro Beach we wondered about previous reports of a lot of seaweed but there was little to none when we were there the end of September. Days of calm Ocean and some days with waves enough to do a little boogie boarding but all in all refreshing.
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,Depending on the weather conditions wavy etc there cou do be a lot of seaweed. However most resorts have someone cleaning Each day. The sands soft and white....really beautiful blue water too!!!
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,Very beautiful beach with soft white sand and gorgeous palm trees. The only negative is that we went in June when there was an absolutely obscene amount of seaweed in water. If you can push pass it you'll enjoy lovely clear warm water.
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,The beach is beautiful but be careful the water is very rough. This beach has white sand and is very clean. There aren't many locals harassing u to buy anything.
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,Loved this beach! Beautiful white sand and clear turquoise water! Lots of Palm trees and vegetation. No seaweed in our 6 day stay at the Grand Palladium Punta Cana! Awesome vacation!
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,This is the white sand blue water beach in paradise. The views are beautiful. There are some vendors there selling however they were generally respectful and kind to us.
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,Bavaro Beach was the nicest beach I have ever been. White sand blue sea which is good for swimming long walks and romantic nights. Would definitely recommend!
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,Lots of seaweed but still a nice beach! Well maintained and the water is perfectly blue and warm all the time.
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,We spent ten days on a resort right on the beach. Every morning before breakfast we took a long walk and enjoyed this wonderful beach. You can walk for miles in both directions. The water was warm and clear for swimming and there is plenty to do including Para sailing fishing... or just relaxing in the sun.
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,We stayed at Secrets Royal Beach and they did a great job maintaining beach. It was clean and they also removed any seaweed daily. Our stretch of beach was very clean and we loved spending all day relaxing in the sun. The water is pretty warm and is a pretty blue to blue green color.
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,This is the most beautiful beach I've ever been to! It's just like in pictures. Warm water not too strong of a current so swimming is pleasurable wasn't much seaweed the sand is like powder. We went everyday for the 7 days we were there. I will definitely return.
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,Bavaro beach is one of my favourite beaches. It is always clean (as side from what tourists leave behind). There is seaweed a sometimes but thats just the ocean doing its work to repair the beaches. The waves are always awesome there. There was a strong undertow when we were there but it was still a lot of fun!
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,Bavaro beach is by far my most favorite place in the world to be! We have stayed at the Now larimar three times (it will be our fourth time on March 30th) and enjoy walking for miles and miles along this beautiful beach! We cannot wait to return!
g147293,d215733,March 3 2016,Juan Gabriel Polanco provided for our every need while we were enjoying our beach hideout at this fabulous resort. We could not have asked for a more attentive gracious server!
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,The Bavaro Beach area is diverse. The beach is sometimes flat sometimes steep some areas have huge waves some have average waves. There is enough differences to make everyone happy. It is very beautiful overall.
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,The best beach for running ever! Beautiful white sand and gorgeous blue water! The area is safe clean and family friendly.
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,stayed in hotel right on beach only thing the had problem with seaweed which they worked very hard to get rid of the beach itself is lovely soft sand beach bar service water warm considering atlantic
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,The beach is normally the best in Punta Cana.. lately the seaweed has been an issue but it's a fantastic swimming ocean and a lovely walk for miles!
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,Beach was very busy with boats and people and a little dirty with garbage and seaweed. Water is clear blue.
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,Beautiful beach as far as the eye can see (and more!) Love the pulsing waves - fun just to float and bob in the water. Wish it was clearer but the waves keep it a bit cloudy (but that's fine - it's still turquoise!) Also LOVE the palm trees and the lack of umbrellas (who needs them here!?)
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,Beautiful warm water and clean. Sitting on the beach was very relaxing and quiet as we were on the adults only side.
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,Beautiful beach! we walked the beach and passed resorts and found of shops. You can pretty much have access to all the resorts on this walk since the beach backs all the hotels. Beautiful.
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,Gorgeous beach! So relaxing and beautiful water. Enjoyed taking Hobie out to sail off this beach. Excellent way to relax.
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,This is a great resort for a winter break plenty of sun & water is warm there are loads of watersports nearby & plenty of restaurants nice white sandy beach ideal for walking along.Travelled as a couple.
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,we had water clean only for few days five other days stayed at pools and kids pools very poor cleaned beach seaweek was making water look yellow and brown instead of blue
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,The beach is very wide and long. The water is beautiful. If you like walking the beach Bravaro Beach is an excellent choice. There are many resorts of all different ratings along the beach so you have to decide on where to stay but if it is along Bravaro Beach  it is a nice place.
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,I went with friends to a public beach in Bavaro. I am sorry I do not remember the name of the beach or the location. I was riding with friends from the DR and sitting in the back seat of the car.
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,Gorgeous beach. Color and temperature of the water is perfect. So much cooler also then being inland.
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,it nice and the palms trees great for photos but the sea is full of brown seaweed ; but if you swim out to the orange barriers there is a reef you can snorkel and see lots of colorful fish and corals !!
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,by far the most beautiful beached in the Dominican Republic. pure white sand crystal blue water as warm as a bath
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,Chose Riu Palace Bavaro because our travel agent said it was in his opinion the nicest in the Dominican Republic. Nice sand  plenty of beach chairs  vendors pass by but never really bothered anyone that I seen. Wonderful place to vacation.
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,I love the white sand and the teal green water. The is very little debri on the beach and the huge palm trees add a nice touch.
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,Great beach. Lots of chairs and shelters. Nice breeze and blue water. One of my top ten beaches. A must do.
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,It has one of the mose breath taking views I've seen. Depending on which hotel you stay at there may not be many shade trees to set under or umbrellas so beware. Plus depending on which hotel you stay at the Hobie Cats are free to use for up to 1 hour
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,I've been to tons of beaches in Mexico and Cuba. Punta Cana Bararo beach is the best! It's groomed daily (sometimes more) It's the perfect wind for sitting in the sun! And I love how blue it is! Everytime it's such a joy to be on and look at! LOVE
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,Absolutely beautiful to see! Pictures are nothing compared to seeing it in person! A must see while in DR!
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,Nice beach to swim in. If you go for a walk prepare to be harassed to buy all sorts of crap by pushy vendors etc
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,Great Beach with a seaweed problem which most hotels clear up daily and to be honest this is mostly out of their control
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,We came to DR for fun in the sun and we had such a lovely time at this beach. Enjoyed this especially because it was not connected to the resort which to this day I still refer to as "the compound". Absolutely beautiful!
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,We had a great week. Blue skies most days and when it rained didn't last long. Pools and beach. Food was good.
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,Depending on where the property that you're staying on the beaches are quite wide and with calm waters.
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,I have been 9 times at the Luxury Hotel Gran Bahia Principe Esmeralda. Every time is a new a EXCELENT experience. I love the service i love the rooms the beach is awesome and the pools also.
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,Speciality restaurants were excellent. Huge facility with two hotels and a mall. 800+ feet of some of the best beach in the world! All inclusive includes top shelf just ask. I have been with my husband 38 years- very romantic floating table dinner would be great place for honeymoon. This place has it all.
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,Stayed mostly in the Bahia Principe area which was cleared of seaweed everyday. Seemed to be the only resort to do so nice touch. But have to say the beach as a whole could not be faulted. Even the local dancing boys who can be iritating were mostly entertaining. Would highly recommend.
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,Amazing beautiful and relaxing beach white sand warm water lots of activities for entertainment is just perfect
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,Bavaro Beach is beautiful. If you are a walker it goes on and on and on. It does have seaweed in spots but that is too be expected. You are at the mercy of nature and the ocean. It is raked up several times a day but each hotel.
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,My wife and I stayed at the Barceló Bavaro Palace Deluxe and loved it. It of course is on the beautiful Bavaro Beach. It has such white sand and the ocean is so gorgeous. We walked for miles down the beach and it is very well taken care of by all of the resorts. Very very nice beach.
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,Memories Splash WaterPark Part of the resort fun for all ages two min from the beach water park included in package. Two min walk to Bavoro beach which is part of the resort also you are in included in The royalton resort beautiful trip and beach plenty to do
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,The beach was so awesome. The sand was beautiful and looked just like it is suppose to. The water was so pretty that at your first Glace it will make you think it's fake or youre dreaming. But it's not! Your in Paradise!
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,The first time I went to Bavaro Beach was a few years ago it was so Tropical. The ocean and the sand was gorgeous. We took our teenage daughters and that was the first time that we saw water like this. We continue to return there and many other beaches in the Dominican
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,Powerful current. Great place to Boogie Board. Don't go out to far otherwise the under currents might take you out to Cuba. No restroom facilities so wear your swimsuit under your clothes and go to the bathroom prior to going there.
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,There are plenty of vendors strolling up and down the beach trying to sell stuff and excursions but this beach is absolutely perfect. If you're in the area you must check it out.
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,Dominican just had a hurricane go through it so there was a lot of seaweed in the ocean usually the ocean is gorgeous it still was beautiful just a lot of seaweed came to the shore
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,I'm not really a beach person but I really enjoyed this beach. Even though there was a lot of seaweed along the beach I still enjoyed the views. I really enjoyed the shade provided by the palm trees because in the States you need beach umbrellas to block out the sun.
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,Beautiful beach. Unfortunately there is a lot of sea weed in the water near the beach which takes away from that tropical turquoise color.
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,Beautiful beach and water. You can walk for miles in each direction and just see beautiful resorts and scenery
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,A great beach great sand not too crowded goes on and on. No big drop off so great for swimming warm water (Sept anyway) happy to go back!
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,Great beach visited for the second time I always like beaches and resorts that have a lot of nature especially palm trees.
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,This beach was part of our dune buggy excursion and we stopped by to take pictures. The weather was overcast and started raining a bit but we all still enjoyed the peace this location brings.
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,Bavaro Beach is stunning! You can walk all day up and down this beautiful beach. The people you meet are great and the cleanliness is crazy! Those guys are always cleaning the beach of seaweed. Just a beautiful place!
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,The beach was within walking distance of the bahia esmeralda. The beach was very nice. The water was clear. The sand is soft a stroll down the beach was very enjoyable. I will be returning.
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,It was like visiting paradise. Everything was just beautiful. Will definitely return with more friends.
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,Currently staying in The Grand Bahia Principe which sits on Bavaro beach :) Beautiful white sand  crystal clear sea ! What more could you ask for ? This beach is the reason we chose to come here
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,One of the best beaches in Punta Cana... been here twice and ready to go back at any time... best resort so far as been the Majestic Colonial. Many other great resorts along this beach set your price and what your willing to pay.
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,Barely any beach vendors. Very rough at night. Beautiful to look at. A ton of seaweed. Makes for beautiful pictures.
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,Beautiful white sand. Usually quite clean but seaweed can be a problem. If you stay close to your resort beach beggars won't bother you. But they a half the fun of being on the beach. And not one of them has ever made my wife or I feel threatened.
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,One of the nicest sections of beach in all of Punta Cana! Azur seas with sugar white "sand" that is actually quartz - and never hot to walk on even in the heat of the day! It is here where those pristine pictures of this tropical oasis are taken!
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,Very nice beacheswarm and transparent waters many water sports available all over the beachmost of the hotels are aconnected to it.
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,Very nice beach which is clean and easy to walk or jog on. There are limited vendors and I felt very safe there.
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,Bavaro Beach was beautiful!!! It was so relaxing. Hearing the waives while having a drink and tanning was priceless.
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,Fantastic beach you can walk for miles you can walk to the shops on the beach there next to ocean sands the sea as washed some of the beach away there but it's still ok
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,Is one of the best beaches in Punta Cana. White sand palms on the beach warm and clear water. Almost paradise but for that you need wild beach untouched by human hands.
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,Beach was breathtakingly beautiful!!! Water was crystal clear and sand was white very very clean beach. sunset was amazing
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,Beautiful area! The locals we encountered as well as staff were friendly and not pushy when selling their wares.
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,Really nice stretch of beach nice to walk to have long walks/runs. Very enjoyable gorgeous palm trees everywhere!!
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,The beaches are whites sand with beautiful blue water. You can walk forever. The trinket sellers and excursion guys are pushy and annoying. You have to be firm if you don't want to be harassed. Just smiling at them seems to give them carte blanche to keep pestering.
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,beautiful beach but seagrass all over the place and nobody keeps it really clean external beach service is not working efficiently at all
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,We have made the trip to this hotel several time and it is away perfect week. The hotel is Bavaro Princess Staff was outstand service and food all inclusive
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,clear and beautiful water really special we arrived by dune buggy highly recommended. Lots of beauty to meet the eye. Quite unspoiled beach.
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,The Beach was beautiful the water warm and welcoming.. There was a lot of seaweeds but that was not an issue. I enjoyed the sun and the music on the beach
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,The beach is beautiful and immaculately maintained. The snorkling was free to guest but only checked out for an hour or two at a time but well worth it. The staff is very friendly and bend over backwards to insure you have the time of your life.
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,One of the best beaches we've been on. Can't say much more than that really! Liked it so much we're returning in October this year to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary.
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,The sea weed was the only downfall but I saw my first shooting star on the beach. I saw alot of beautiful views
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,We were here in August 2013 for our honeymoon. It is the most beautiful beach. Water is clear and the sand is white and sugary. Really recommend the beaches of Bavaro
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,I loved the beach. Soft sand that reminds me of Ion sea.Despite of the seaweed which some people disliked I would say a beautiful beach
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,Don't have time or have lots of cash ? I would go here they rush you ask for tips take pics and ask for more money... And they want you relax and enjoy? Lol consider beach vendors they are cheaper and much better fun for your money!
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,Beach is apart of the Atlantic Ocean not the Caribbean so water is very cool. There is a large amount of sea weed covering the beaches. Still enjoyed the beach just not a much as in other Caribbean destinations.
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,This beach was overly crowded and too many locals approach trying to guilt you into buying things. Just stay in the states!
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,This beach is very beautiful and peaceful. Clear water and white sand. Our resort was right on this beach and we loved it
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,Loved the Bavaro Beach! The water was warm and calm and we bad a fantastic stay at the Bavaro Princess Hotel!
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,One thing for sure is that I love beaches. This was my first trip the Dominican Republic and it definitely will not be the last. Bavaro beach was a relaxing atmosphere for me. I traveled alone and had no problem with being there by myself.
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,Great place if you would like to go out of the resort. Have scuba and snorkeling classes. This is the public beach is Punta Cana and doesn't have palm and restaurant
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,All the restaurants in this complex were good. I'd skip the Japanese only because it is so familiar but the rest were fine!
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,Despite of the seaweed a beautiful beach. The people from the various hotels along Bavaro beach do each day a hell of a job to remove the seaweed.
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,I loved everything about it. The softest sand my toes have ever felt. You'll love the amenities that Secrets offers. I learned how to operate a catamaran!
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,My fiance and I stayed for 15 nights at this piece of paradise. The beach is beautiful cristal clear water and hot weather. Every one have to go at least one time to Punta Cana.
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,We went on a "booze cruise" from here on our honeymoon. It is a beautiful beach with calmer water than the side my husband and I stayed on. The cruise was the most fun we had on our honeymoon. We went snorkeling! It was fantastic!
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,Beautiful except for sea weed but workers kept trying to clean it up. They had the VIP section which was great a lot of loungers but maybe they could have some higher ones for handicap people who can not get way down on the loungers.
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,Nice beach but this time sea weed was big issue but this is mother nature does not have to do much wit ressort
g147293,d215733,March 2 2016,The sand felt like icing sugar it was sooooo soft!!!!! Very clean and lots of water sports to partake in...can't wait to go back!!!!!!!!!!
g147342,d149013,March 2 2016,
g147342,d149013,February 15 2016,We enjoyed meeting Liz the roti lady and enjoyed her delicious chicken roti. Her banana nut bread was great as well. Give her roti a try while you are on the beach its quite yummy and very reasonably priced.
g147342,d149013,February 12 2016,
g147342,d149013,February 12 2016,Came here whilst on a cruise and came across Liz roti she walks the beach selling homemade roti I had chicken it was amazing but beware liz's homemade pepper sauce blasts your head off the beach is busy when the cruise ships come in but there is plenty of room for everyone and safe bathing too
g147342,d149013,February 12 2016,
g147342,d149013,February 12 2016,Beautiful beach not too crowded convention- beach chairs and umbrellas available at a very reasonable price food and drinks at Spinnaker (a little pricey for the quality). Ample water sports activities available- water sofa jet skiis. Do not miss eating food from a local vendor- Liz's Roti- she has amazing roti's- fish roti chicken roti etc.
g147342,d149013,February 12 2016,
g147342,d149013,February 12 2016,This is a good beach convenient to town in Rodney Bay . It is a good beach to walk up and down. Many lounges and umbrellas may be found . It is a good beach to people-watch.
g147342,d149013,February 12 2016,Must visit beach in St lucia. Frequented by locals and tourists alike. Lots of vendors around selling tourist trap products.

g147342,d149013,February 12 2016,I love the color of the sand the nice clean calm crystal clear water st lucia is the prettiest Island my husband and I both agree. We love it . Also I read that st lucia is The number one hotspot for honey moons adventure nd sighting .

g147342,d149013,February 12 2016,Glorious golden sand lovely to watch the sunset have a beer at Spinnakers (food is awful) - watch out for the rum punch it will blow your socks off.
g147342,d149013,February 12 2016,This is a lovely beach to spend the day when there are no cruise ships in port. On the days the big ships are in it's pandemonium. Luckily by 3 pm they are all herded back to the prison ships and we have the beach to ourselves again to watch the beautiful sunset and sip cocktails in the Spinnaker bar.

g147342,d149013,February 12 2016,Beautiful beach secluded and quiet. However local peddlers became very annoying. Wouldn't take no for an answer.
g147342,d149013,February 12 2016,If your're in Rodney Bay Village visiting Reduit beach is a must. I took a water taxi from Laborette Bay to Reduit which took only minutes. Its chill beach to relax and even snorkel.

g147342,d149013,February 12 2016,We liked the beach. We walked from bay gardens and were given free lounge chairs and we enjoyed the view of the various boats and mountains. There were a few vendors but they were polite and non aggressive. Also there was a lot of security who seemed to be checking to see if vendors were bothersome
g147342,d149013,February 12 2016,
g147342,d149013,February 12 2016,
g147342,d149013,February 12 2016,Of the five beaches we have visited during our cruise this one was the least enjoyable: it was just OK. Too many people (including those playing loud music next to us) vendors constantly trying to sell you stuff. Next time if there is one we will go elsewhere.

g147342,d149013,February 12 2016,
g147342,d149013,February 12 2016,Reduit Beach was absolutely fascinating to me. There's jet skis tubing paragliding and all sorts of activities to do. Also some places to grab drinks or food on the beach. I loved it there! The sun sets right over the water and it is truly amazing. I rode horses on the beach with friends and met plenty of nice people.

g147342,d149013,February 12 2016,
g147342,d149013,February 12 2016,Maybe because it was September but it was very quiet and not as breathtaking as beaches in Jamaica which is why I have only given it an average score but it was a nice beach to visit.
g147342,d149013,February 12 2016,
g147342,d149013,February 12 2016,
g147342,d149013,February 12 2016,while swimming need to pay attention to the jet ski running too close to the shore. the beach is very beautiful
g147342,d149013,February 12 2016,Nice beach area to relax at and mingle with the locals - there are a lot of beach hagglers but a firm and polite No and they leave you alone.
g147342,d149013,February 12 2016,
g147342,d149013,February 12 2016,We had a great time at Reduit Beach. We bought some drinks & were able to use the establishments beach chairs. Right on the beach we rented a jet ski & banana boat to ride & had a blast! Beach was beautiful white sand & crystal clear water. We had a wonderful day!
g147342,d149013,February 12 2016,My time in St.Lucia was wonderful. Sabrina's food was great as well as "auntie Grace" enjoyed Shady Ranks hospitality and can't forget "Peanut" One Love. Wanda
g147342,d149013,February 12 2016,This is probably one of the more beautiful beaches in St Lucia since it does have the light sand and many of St Lucia's other beaches have the dark gray sand. If you like to go "where the action is" and be where everyone else is then this is the beach for you. Lots of people. Lots of activity.

g147342,d149013,February 12 2016,Located in the heart of Rodney Bay a scenic beach to stay on while vacationing in St. Lucia!
g147342,d149013,February 12 2016,Superb beach with a brilliant view of Pigeon Island / Signal Point there is a good eatery at the very left with locl food and drink. Beach vendors are pleasant but it can be a pain.
g147342,d149013,February 12 2016,
g147342,d149013,February 12 2016,It is a nice beach but very crowded. You will be interrupted by local vendors quite abit. Kind of annoying when you are trying to read a book and relax. Beer & restaurants are easily accessible from beach chair which was nice. Highly recommend Bay Gardens resort for lunch good prices and good food.
g147342,d149013,February 12 2016,
g147342,d149013,February 12 2016,We walked all the way down the beach near the little bar as it was not as busy there. You can park your vehicle close as well. Water was calm clear and fairly shallow for quite a ways out. Would go here again.

g147342,d149013,February 12 2016,This beach was amazing. Beautiful calm aqua water with sail boats everywhere.The sand is clean with little to no seaweed. This was my favorite beach on the island of St Lucia. The beach is free and public parking is free too.

What wasn't typical was the borage of vendors that wouldn't take a polite no for an answer. We won't be returning to this site. Joyce from spinnakers did a nice job of making us feel welcome.

g147342,d149013,February 12 2016,Looks like others are trying to cash in on Liz's success selling hot roti and cakes but if you want to purchase from the real Liz she has her name written on her food box and sometimes on her teeshirt. Her food is great and a cheap lunch compared to the hotel prices. Phil

g147342,d149013,February 12 2016,Nice beach but really nothing special. Crowded. So many boats and water activities that it's almost impossible to get to the deeper part and really get some swimming.
g147342,d149013,February 12 2016,
g147342,d149013,February 12 2016,The beach is nice but not sure why its ranked as one of the best beaches on the island. There could be better common facilities ie washrooms food options
g147342,d149013,February 12 2016,Great beach but some of the local beach staff need some serious education in hospitality/tourism. Rude and overbearing at times. We will stick to other beaches in future where there are no hawkers and staff are friendlier.
g147342,d149013,February 12 2016,
g147342,d149013,February 12 2016,Takes your breath away! A clean and well kept beach with beautiful ocean views. You can see yachts and boats in the distance. Surprisingly the water is cold but your body gets used to the temperature.

g147342,d149013,February 12 2016,I love this beach. We usually go right around spinnakers. The water is clear and calm. No one to trouble you there. A hand full of vendors but no pressure from them. I truly believe that this is the best beach in st lucia
g147342,d149013,February 12 2016,just spent some time here not really hassled badly no more than any other public beach we have been on a good few fish about so a chance for snorkelling water taxi to pidgeon island from here and hi to liz the roti and cake lady who we used on several occasions
g147342,d149013,February 12 2016,
g147342,d149013,February 12 2016,A great day of swimming. A fresh hot chicken roti hits the spot washed down with a Piton beer (self supplied). So good. You have to get her before she runs out because once they're gone for the day you're fresh out of luck.

g147342,d149013,February 12 2016,
g147342,d149013,February 12 2016,We visited this beach during our recent cruise. You are swarmed by vendors selling everything from t-shirts to jewelry to renting chairs etc. We did rent a couple jet skis which were very old and did not run well at all. Not one of the nicer beaches we visited during the trip.
g147342,d149013,February 12 2016,
g147342,d149013,February 12 2016,Nice beach but seen better in other Caribbean places liked it being so quiet hated nothing about it
g147342,d149013,February 12 2016,
g147342,d149013,February 12 2016,The beach was very clean sandy plenty of sunbeds gentle shelf safe for all to go into sea. Traders coming round were no problem and just as happy to talk as to sell.
g147342,d149013,February 12 2016,We spent several afternoons on Reduit Beach and the surrounding area. The beach has lots of activity but gets crowded when the ships are in.
g147342,d149013,February 12 2016,Pestered a lot by guys selling drinks craft items sun loungers. We only stayed an hour because of constant hassle
g147342,d149013,February 12 2016,Bring your sunscreen and as others said check the cruise ship schedule. We went when there were very few people. Beautiful beach. You have to learn to say no to the vendors but most were pretty friendly. Wish we could have stayed longer. $10 for an umbrella and two chairs is reasonable. Parking near the police station is free.
g147342,d149013,February 12 2016,Very nice beach the sand is great the ocean is turquoise and very suprising not a lot of people... it's a public beach!
g147342,d149013,February 12 2016,
g147342,d149221,February 12 2016,
g147342,d149221,February 12 2016,Beautiful white sand beach located right between the Pitons. Amazing views and amazing water. We arrived there by boat from Soufriere and spent a couple hours at the beach as part of an island tour. Definitely a highlight of Saint Lucia and not to be missed. I cant wait to go back again.
g147342,d149221,February 12 2016,Beautiful beach in between the Pitons that is located at the Sugar beach resort. Calm waters for swimming and we saw a variety of fish and an eel while snorkeling. It is a quick five minute ride on a water taxi to get to the beach.
g147342,d149221,February 12 2016,This place is amazing. The Viceroy owns the place but the beach is public. I think its overpriced but it sure is beautiful. 2 nights and I paid over 1800 total.
g147342,d149221,February 12 2016,All beaches in St. Lucia are public even if there is a ritzy resort close by. This beach is a marine reserve with great snorkeling. The fish variety is great but what got me was the coral. Beautiful shapes and colors.
g147342,d149221,February 12 2016,Part of the Cosol Tour itinerary. Came here by speedboat...a fun trip. The area is beautiful to swim and snorkel. Did not come in contact with the resort visitors. The area very nice for tour groups.
g147342,d149221,February 12 2016,
g147342,d149221,February 12 2016,The setting here is gorgeous and the snorkeling is amazing. It's definitely worth a visit. Snorkel gear is available for rental. Be sure to wear or pack water shoes; the beach at the snorkeling area is extremely rocky and it is very difficult (and painful) to enter the water with bare feet.

g147342,d149221,February 12 2016,
g147342,d149221,February 12 2016,Beach facilities were mostly limited to paying resident guests so not friendly to day trippers who have to cram into a small area. Water was murky. Not so many fish or much coral of interest.

g147342,d149221,February 12 2016,We spent a few hours one morning at Jalousie Beach as guests from Ladera. Just as others have commented the hotel staff was not welcoming of guests. The setting between the Pitons was quite nice but the beach was small and rocky. Nearby construction noise was a negative.
g147342,d149221,February 12 2016,The nice part of the beach is where the resort is but you can't go on that beach unless your a guest even though it is public. Found it to be very rocky. The best part about this beach is the view of the Pitons.

g147342,d149221,February 12 2016,We stopped here and walked the small beach. Just to say we were there and put our feet in the Carribean Sea.Our guideVicky gave us some information about the hotel. Getting there was a trip. Can't believe all the hairpin turns on the roads. Not just there but throughout the Island.
g147342,d149221,February 12 2016,Beach is well manicured clean. There is nice restaurant nearby run by Viceroy Resort. Clean and snoby...
g147342,d149221,February 12 2016,The darkest cleast water for snorkeling I have ever seen. It was a darker color but seriously crystal clear and the sand was really comfortable underneath too. We took a short break here but it was really fun!
g147342,d149221,February 12 2016,We went here as part of a tour - the snorkeling was really good and you can use the sunbeds to the left of the beach for free. Very pretty
g147342,d149221,February 12 2016,Super snorkeling at end of beach - you can sit on chairs next to snorkeling area free of charge (some shade available there also). Most of main beach (with its fancy chairs and umbrellas) however is restricted to resort clients - so just sit near snorkeling area.
g147342,d149221,February 12 2016,Beautiful clean beach with an area to snorkel. Water Taxi available for @ 70.00$ -100$ round trip make sure you haggle the price or share the ride with others.
g147342,d149221,February 12 2016,
g147342,d149221,February 12 2016,Great snorkeling even better views. We saw this on Cosol Tours via a water taxi which made the visit to this beach even better.
g147342,d149221,February 12 2016,

g147342,d149221,February 12 2016,Beautiful picturesque beach with wonderful snorkeling. It is set just between the pitons with a view of each. Absolutely breathtaking.
g147342,d149221,February 12 2016,We stayed at ladera resort and they provide free shuttle to this beach. Beach is very small. The water is calm and refreshing but wear water shoes as it is a bit rocky don't step on a sea urchin. This is also where boats come to pick up people going out on day trips.
g147342,d149221,February 12 2016,
g147342,d149221,February 12 2016,
g147342,d149221,February 12 2016,You park up from the beach and one of the Viceroy's shuttles takes you down to the beach. The food at the beach is very very expensive so bring your own. They have all the water activities that someone could want. The beach is unreal as it's positioned right between the 2 pitons (volcano tops you see in photos)
g147342,d149221,February 12 2016,
g147342,d149221,February 12 2016,
g147342,d149221,February 12 2016,we took the family snorkeling here and the road to the beach was long and bumpy. they allowed boats to come right up to the shore and you had to wade through them to get to the snorkeling location. It was scary at times to see how close the motors came to swimmers

g147342,d149221,February 12 2016,
g147342,d149221,February 12 2016,Between the Pitons. We stopped to snorkel after climbing the Gros Piton. They let you park and then you can walk down to the beach. Snorkeling was good but not fabulous--is to the right at the very base of the Petit Piton.

g147342,d149221,February 12 2016,We were staying at a private Vila near Anse Chastanet and decided to visit for the day. Great decision. Attentive staff and great service on the beach. The beach itself is picturesque with it's view up the side of the Pitons. Take a friendly water taxi for a nice ride around the coast.
g147342,d149221,February 12 2016,This beach was busy & a little littered but had incredible snorkeling on a reef just off shore! I would suggest water shoes or wearing your fins in it's quite rocky just off the beach.
g147342,d149221,February 12 2016,
g147342,d149221,February 12 2016,By far the best snorkelling we did in St. Lucia. Well worth the price of an excursion if the trip takes you here. We went with Joys Cruise which was great.
g147342,d149221,February 12 2016,Couldn't get my son out of the water the reef is amazing great snorkelling nice white sandy area where you can sit and buy a meal or beer from the local hotel there. Fabulous just how you imagine a Carribean bench should be x

g147342,d149221,February 12 2016,Being between the Pitons this beach is like no other - and snorkeling with iridescent squid is a once in a lifetime treat. Arrive by water taxi if you have the chance.
g147342,d149221,February 12 2016,
g147342,d149221,February 12 2016,The Spencer Ambrose beach break was wonderful but the smooth boat handling by Raymond and the easy listening talk provided by Terry could not be beat. Swim and snorkel between the Pitons with them for the whole day. The longer the better! Thanks guys!

g147342,d149221,February 12 2016,We stopped at the beach for about an hour as part of a day excursion from Rodney Bay. The snorkeling was amazing and the view of Le Gros Piton left us breathless. We didn't spend much time on the beach but it was very nice.

g147342,d149221,February 12 2016,We walked in and it was a long walk we also brought our own snorkeling gear which was unnecessary as rentals were inexpensive. Lots to see underwater very scenic cove with lush mountain backdrop and a nice beachside bar.

g147342,d150064,February 12 2016,Excellent snorkeling right off the beach but the area can be quite crowded in peak holiday seasons. Tiki huts available for Anse Chastanet and Jade mountain guests are available for rental to those not staying at the resorts.

g147342,d150064,February 12 2016,Once we found it we had a great time. Food at the restaurant was expensive but very good ($60 for two ham sandwiches and 2 drinks). The snorkeling in the marine reserve was beautiful with lots of colorful fish to see. Afterwards we laid on a hammock and enjoyed the beach. Very very beautiful here.
g147342,d150064,February 12 2016,
g147342,d150064,February 12 2016,What a great hotel. First class service from excellent staff. The food was lovely and nothing was too much trouble. It was a long time since we had been to st lucia but we will definitely be going back. Antigua and Barbados could learn a thing or two!
g147342,d150064,February 12 2016,
g147342,d150064,February 12 2016,we chartered a private sunset sail from Marigot Bay to the Pitons and stopped by Anse Chastenet for and hour of snorkeling. What a stop.... the setting is spectacular and the snorkeling is amazing with sapphire blue waters millions of colorful fish. We loved our visit here.

The road leading up to the beach and its adjoining pair of luxury hotels is long winding and extremely bumpy but it's definitely worth the trek for the wonderfully clear waters and glorious outlook.
g147342,d150064,February 12 2016,We stayed at anse chastenet resort and the beach is great has everything you need and everyone stopped here for snorkeling. Walk over to anse mamin at the steps by the end of the beach for another awsome view. ..and a burger ... and a hike.

g147342,d150064,February 12 2016,We only snorkeled here by boat so have no comments on the beach itself. The snorkeling was fine but really nothing special. It's certainly not the best or the worst I have ever done.
g147342,d150064,February 12 2016,Beautiful beach but personally I liked Jalouse Beach better because of the views of the Pitons. The waters seemed a bit lighter in color than Jalousie Beach. You can also rent a hut for USD 30 unlike Jalousie where we were told the huts were only for residents. We experienced a friendlier staff here than at Jalousie.

g147342,d150064,February 12 2016,Snorkeling and diving just off Anse Chastanet Beach was beautiful and easily accessible. Restaurants and bar service on the beach were also outstanding. Water sports equipment of all kinds available.

g147342,d150064,March 5 2016,All I can say is it was a world class beach and a pretty darn good shore dive on the reef and also excellent for snorkeling. The services for diving were excellent.

g147342,d150064,March 5 2016,Best shore dive ever. And a great lunch between the dives. The resort extremely nice - not to mention Jade Mountain resort sister property. Scuba St Lucia was a top notch dive shop.
g147342,d150064,March 5 2016,All I can say is it was a world class beach and a pretty darn good shore dive on the reef and also excellent for snorkeling. The services for diving were excellent. I did not stay at the resort way out of my budget but it also appeared world class. You won't be disappointed.

g147342,d150064,March 5 2016,Best "walk-in" snorkeling on the island. The beach is pretty and without vendors. Best bet is to get there by water taxi. We used Alex in Marigot Bay (he's great). Of course if you want any food or drink you're stuck with the resort's very expensive bar.
g147342,d150064,March 5 2016,The beach is beautiful. It does feel a little crowded and the scuba is expensive. (11/hour). The beach down the way seems to collect much less people I’d head that way if you’re looking for more peace and quiet. I’d also recommend suba diving at Sugar Beach. That being said the beach is awesome and very scenic.

g147342,d150064,March 5 2016,There is a great reef off of this beautiful beach. We went snorkeling with the company that operates off the beach and they led us to an amazing reef. One of the best I've seen.
g147342,d150064,March 5 2016,The beach is described as black sand -- the water was a beautiful blue. We took a boat from Soufriere snorkeled had lunch and lounged on this beach for the day. It was out favorite beach. Food and drinks were pricey but just go with it!

g147365,d2198364,March 9 2016,This was a great stop on our tour. Our guide took us to the far end of the sandbar and were instantly surrounded by stingrays. We loved feeding and holding them it was so amazing. Our guild was great and kept us away from the big crowds at the other end of the sand bar.
g147365,d2198364,March 8 2016,Incredible experience! A must do in Grand Cayman! The stingrays are gentle and come right up when a new boat arrives. The water is shallow & clear.
g147365,d2198364,March 8 2016,I was amazed by Romance of the Seas captain and his crew. Very knowledgeable and it was such an adventure. Be careful if you get sea sick since the boat will rock under the waves. And getting on/off the boat can be tricky.
g147365,d2198364,March 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 8 2016,If you go to the Cayman Islands there's nothing better then to feed the Stingrays even hold one. Take the Cayman Island Sailing Charter for a personal once in a life time experience.
g147365,d2198364,March 7 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 6 2016,This is an awesome experience that you should not miss if you're going to be in Grand Cayman. Please see my review of Moby Dick Tours for a more in-depth review.
g147365,d2198364,March 6 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 6 2016,One of the best experiences of my life the stingrays are right below you and free in their natural habitat. The 20 min boat ride was great and you can go snorkeling around there too. A must!

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Wife wanted to do this forever so we did. Glad we did it. She loved it and I even enjoyed doing it. Water is really clear and it was a great experience.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Although I have done this trip numerous times a recent visit with a friend was still an amazing adventure- the excitement of getting into the water with the stingrays cannot be underestimated- it is fabulous! It is a "must" when visiting Grand Cayman

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Our 2nd visit here over the last few years but enjoyed it just as much as the first time. Unique experience for fairly low dollars

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,This is a wonderful experience. It is fun for the experienced snorkeler or the one who is nervous about the water. Even our 2 year old grandson went in and pet a stingray. We have been several always on Red Sail very safe and loved it!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,

We went with Six Senses Cayman Adventures. They were amazing tour guides ... Very friendly fun and knowledgable!! I would highly recommend going with them.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Worth the short trip out to the sandbar. This is our third visit via the Heavenly Hooker boat-for-hire operator. A great experience but can get crowded if the cruise ships are in port!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,What can I say so totally corny yet so amazing at the same time. JUST DO IT!! Everyone is afraid but glad that they did it when it was done.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We loved going with White Sands since they offer a 7am trip from Kaibo Yacht club. Get the Stingrays all to yourselves!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We were taken by Soto's Cruises and had a great time feeding petting and handling the Rays. They have a very experienced staff to help people feel comfortable with the rays.

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,What a great experience!!! Highly recommend doing this. We had such a great time. They are actually so sweet and docile. Was able to hold them. We took the wave runners off the Holiday Inn property which worked our perfect.

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,I'm not sure what I was expecting but Stingray City was so much more of an experience than I could have imagined. Having the opportunity to interact with these beautiful creatures was incredible. Our entire family loved every minute.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Went with six senses eco tour. Could've stayed all day swimming with sting rays in their natural environment. Best thing ever.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,If you visit the grand cayman island you must book a tour to see the sting rays. It was one of the most amazing things I have ever done. Defiantly a once in a lifetime experience! It can be a little terrifying but it is defiantly worth it! 5+ stars for me!!!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Sting Ray City is a must do from young to old. The experience is like no other. The staff from Captain Marvin's was excellent
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,I did not want to do this but had the greatest time! We started by going to the reef to snorkel then went swimming in another area. Then we ended up by the stingrays! What a dun adventure! The guides were very knowledgeable and understanding of my nervousness. A must do for everyone- even chickens like me!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,This is a great place for young and old to experience sea life and understand sting rays aren't the dangerous animal everyone believes them to be.

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,This outing should be a must on everyone's list if they go to Cayman. We take all of our visitors there. We have been there 20 times and don't get tired of it!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We went with a group of friends. Better to pick a day when the cruise ships aren't in - unless of course you arrived on a ship ! Lots of fun. Kiss a sting ray for seven years luck!!

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,A special place to dive and interact with lots a Sting Ray fish. You can feed the rays. It is very lovely and paiceful.

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,The Southern Sting Rays were huge and gentle. Waves were a bit rough which made it hard for our kids (and me) to stand in the water.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,I have never gotten the chance to get so close to these amazing creatures. It was such a unique experience.

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,This is definitely something everyone needs to do if you are at Cayman Island. Lots of fun for everyone of all ages.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,My wife was a little scared about swimming with sting rays but she was glad that we did it. What a memory! We went with Captain Dexter. It was a relaxing ride on a catamaran and the group size was small which is a plus!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Great afternoon at Stingray City. The water is gorgeous clear and the stingrays are plentiful. They glide by you and feel like velvet. It is an amazing experience to be surrounded by these beautiful creatures. A definite must!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,What an amazing experience. fun for the entire family and being one with nature in the sea! Definitely something that can be done over and over again.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Everyone in every age group should do this attraction if you come to grand Cayman. Amazing! Will always remember it. The sting rays are so friendly and alien i never thought I'd see old woman kiss song rays and laugh with joy but it's impossible not to smile while enjoying this encounter. Just do it you won't regret it!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,This adventure is a must do when visiting Grand Cayman! I've never had an experience like that! Probably 50 or more Stingrays swimming around my feet! Crazy and slightly creepy but what a memory!! We did a 1 1/2 trip that also included a short snorkeling adventure! Loved it!!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,If there's on activity you need to do in Cayman is Stingray City. Awesome :) Step in the water and feed the stingrays
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Fantastic vista! Crystal clear water friendly sting rays everywhere. Got 7 years good luck for kissing the sting ray and great pics to prove it!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We did this as an excursion from a cruise ship. It's a short boat ride to the sand bar. Lots of stingrays to swim with. The clearest water I've seen in my life shallow enough for kids too. I would do it again in a heartbeat.

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,The Stingray Sandbar was amazing. These beautiful gentle creatures come right up to you. You can feed them squid and also hold one!!

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,They say if you kiss a stingray you will have seven years of good luck!! I don't know if this is true but I can say that it is fun. If you are ever in Grand Cayman you got to try this. Ask your guide for a stingray massage as well. What a beautiful place!!!!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,If you want to see the Rays go when it's quiet rather than when there are hundreds all trying to see and do all at the same time.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,What a wonderful experience. Nice boat ride out about 6 miles to a sandbar where we went into the warm water and feed the stingrays. Lots of other boats and people out there but room for all. I love the natural setting. We had a calm water day so that made the experience even better.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Sometimes the hype is just that but when it comes to Stingray City it's impossible to overhype. Pristine crystal clear water friendly wildlife gorgeous weather the experience of a lifetime. Even if you're not a strong swimmer or keen on water related activities this excursion should NOT be missed.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,An experience of a life time. There was nothing to complain about. Very educational and filled with adventure.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Beautiful! A must see for anyone new to the island. We live here and still go out to Sting Ray City a few times a year. It never gets old.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Stingray City is awesome Moby Dick Tours are the best they make it fun and safe for people of all ages and abilities.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Wow! We truly enjoyed this experience. The sting rays were beautiful (and friendly). The gentleman were informative. Great!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,My wife and daughter didn't want to do it but after being in the water with the sting ray an d seeing how gentle they were they loved it! We booked on Red Sail's 65' catamaran and glad we did. Our boat wasn't crowded like we saw many others that seemed to have stand up room only!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,This was a surreal and amazing experience. We got to feed them swim with them hold them and pet them. They seemed so friendly! Their massive size and speed made the rays seem scary but they acted pretty tame. I would highly recommend this to every animal lover.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Beautiful water and lots of stingray to interact with. Definitely recommend going there on a catamaran with Lorenzo from Sun Rays Tours. Worth every penny!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Our family always loves to do this trip! It never gets old! The catamaran ride is great staff very knowledgable and the swim with the rays very memorable! Our kids have always loved it! We've made some great memories out in Sting Ray City! Definitely worth the money!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We were able to hold stingrays and take pictures with no rushing since we were a smaller group. We were told the differences between males and females as well as feeding them which was cool.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,This is a must visit when you are on our beautiful island. A once in a lifetime experience.There are many great tour operators who will take you out there for an amazing day.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,As soon as you enter the water these really large creatures surround you like my dogs do when I come home from work. Each one trying to get all the attention. I've never seen anything like it. These are not the same animal that killed Steve Irwin. I asked.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Not to be missed. Enjoyable for adults and kids. You can fee them and swim next to them. Definitely worth the price. Board the catamaran and ride out to the sandbar for an experience you will remember for a long time.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Amazing family experience - boating out to a sand bar that's as shallow as 2 feet in some places great for little kids swimming among the sting rays and getting to hold or touch them - awesome!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We had perfect weather which made our experience even better! We saw around 30 stingrays and our boat had a prof photographer so we got pictures kissing the sting rays! Very memorable experience! Will def recommend a trip to Sting Ray City to everyone!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Stingray City was one of the highlights of our trip. Took the glass bottom boat trip from Rum Point. Swimming with the gentle stingrays is an opportunity of a lifetime. Don't miss it!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Best and most popular destination while in the Caymans so fun for all ages. After boating a good 30 minutes or so you come onto mutliple sandbars and get out waistdeep cristal blue wáter stingrays come around like hungry dogs so gente and calm to feed. Such a fun time for all!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Great experience & thoroughly enjoyable. Very professional guides & very safety conscious. Although pictures were taken of everyone with a stingray there was no hard sell.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We arranged this trip in advance theough a company nit the cruise ship. It was great fun fir all ages. If you are here this is a must do!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,This is a once in a lifetime experience. Located in the middle of the sea those animals will eat right out of your hand with their super soft skin. A must do when on grand Cayman.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,It may reflect the limited excitement of Cayman but still one of those "at one with nature experiences of a lifetime". The rays flock into the shallows and are not averse to human contact - as fascinated with us as vice versa. No danger; excellent for youngsters.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,went with another couple and had a great experience. good for adults or families alike. Lots of fun and adventure
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,found the stingrays initially intimidating but clearly almost domesticated. they were gentle and people friendly. Unexpectedly huge.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,It's a must see! You get to swim with the stingrays. Your guides will usually get one for you to touch but dont worry they don't mind brushing up with your legs in the four foot sand bar.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,A must see tour if you visit the island. Stingray sandbar offers amazingly clear water waist deep where you can swim with feed and touch dozens of stingrays. Such a great experience.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,you can get up close and personal with the sting rays amazingly gentle creatures. I actually held a stingray and fed it.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We loved Sting Ray City! Take Captain Marvin's Tour! The rays are so soft and fun to feed! We will be back!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,didn't make it to Sting Ray City on this visit to Grand Caymans but have done so in the past Nice little cove where the stingrays are trained to eat out of your hand and will not harm you. They are pretty tame. Such a velvety feeling when they pass by you.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Definitely do the Breakfast with the Rays sail through Red Sail Sports. It is worth getting up early and being the first boat to Sting Ray City before the cruise ships crowds emerge. The sting rays are majestic and is truly a wonderful experience.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,This is a unique experience that I don't know you will find any where else. It's definitely worth the trip. I would suggest going as early as possible to avoid the crowds.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Great hands on excursion -- but I stayed on the boat. I was "sketched" about their tail. Steve Irwin died...so can we. There was no medical facility that I could see -- didn't want to chance it. I was scared but in fairness my travel companions LOVED iT
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Everything about the trip was just great. Friendly staff and even friendlier Stingrays. Thank you for a great experience
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,As a professional Biologist this is one of the most incredible experiences that you can have with a creature in the wild.

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,It is a very nice experience you get to interact with the stingray you can touch them and even kiss them the only problem is that it is usually overcrowded.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Before I left for Grand Cayman everyone was telling me you have to go to Sting Ray City. I wasn't going to go because the thought freaked me out a bit. After getting there and talking to others I decided to give it a go. Best experience ever!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We book this excursion during while we were on a recent cruise. This experience is absolutely unforgettable. They take you out to a sand bar and and let you get in the water with the rays. We had a wonderful time with the critters. This was offered on the Princess cruise we took.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,The rays are amazing and range in size from 1 foot to 6 feet They are so graceful to be swimming with them is truly amazing

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Even though you think this is strictly a tourist spot it is a must seen if you are on Grand Cayman. We have seen the Stingrays on Bora Bora but this spot is not to be missed.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We had great fun at Sting Ray City tame and docile sting rays swim right up next to you. Beautify water and transportation there.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Beautiful very well done can not get this any where else! They offer and take pictures at a reasonable price.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,These are called the "Cayman Pussycats" for a good reason they really are gentle creatures. We did a 12 person tour with Ambassador and it was perfect! Take lots of sunscreen and be prepared to be amazed by these wild creatures.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,There are many ways to get there but as long as you get there! The tours have squid to feed them but keep the bait above water or the fish will get it quick. fun and realy domesticated shuffle your feet when you walk and everything will be good.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,As soon as the boat arrived several stingrays were already surrounding the boat. The stingray were so gentle and we had the experienced of holding it kissing it and also got body massage. The sand bar was only waist deep. We were advised to kiss the stingray to give us 7 years of good luck.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Only word todescribe standing in shallow water with stingrays swimming around you?.. cooooool. This was a gorgeous and amazing site to see. My kids loved it as well.

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Phenomenal experience great for all ages. Highly recommended Bring some squid with you if you want to feed them

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,If you've never been to Cayman this is an experience of a lifetime to interact and feed sting rays. It is amazing! Went with Cayman Adventure tours. Captain Chris is awesome. He took us there and then snorkeling and he showed us a morey eel that was amazing! Don't miss this excursion from your cruise ship!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,This was the second time spent swimming with the stingrays. What an incredibly awesome experience. Captain Eddy was very entertaining and the crew members extremely patient especially with the young children.

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We did not book anything in advance but when we got off the Norwegian Epic we met up with Sting ray city tours where we paid only 25 dollars a person for Stingray swim and then snorkeling in the coral . The tour was well worth it and then some. We had the time of our lives!!!! Highly recommended!!!!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,If you are traveling to Cayman you simply must go to Stingray City. It'll be the highlight of your trip.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Loved the docile sting rays and the crystal clear water. The sting rays swim right up and around you. It's a little intimidating at first but once you see they are just looking for food you can realize how awesome these animals are. I would highly recommend this.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,I was young when I went there with relatives but it was awesome. It hadad== a little of everything for all ages
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,This was one of the best days of my cruise! I was the skeptical one that said that I would not swim with the stingrays but I loved it! The water is beautiful and I hope that I can return someday.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We set out with Red Sail sports for there morning trip out to see the sting rays. The weather was perfect for everyone to enjoy the day. Well worth the money
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,I liked everything about this excursion having visited on a private charter that was not crowded. If you can I would recommend a private boat. The only way to visit!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,If you are on a cruise ship get a group together and try to book a private tour. We have been there twice and the private boat can get out there early which makes all the difference between chaos and a wonderful expericnce feeding and petting the stingrays. Be the first off the ship and first to stingray city.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,The early morning trip was the perfect way to interact with the stingrays. The staff onboard Captain Marvin"s were very accommodating and helpful. I'd recommend this company. Don't let the crusty clerk at the ticket station ruin your trip.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Liked the sun boat ride snorkeling and swimming with the stingrays...Disliked that the day had to end!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,One of the best experiences in Cayman everything is just so nice around and you have the opportunity to enjoy the freedom of the stingrays.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,The Stingrays were very gentile! Didn't know what to expect in the middle of the ocean... But enjoyed myself so much!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We snorkeled off the glass bottom boat. The whole trip was excellent. the captain and crew made sure our whole family even our very young grandsons had a wonderful time. I would highly recommend this trip.

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,As a professional salesman on the move I have to say this is not a good place to have that initial face to face meeting. I also wasn't happy about the lack of wheel chair access.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Moby Dick Tours - kept us laughing and they were the friendliest people Mark Richard and Nicholas. Held the sting Ray Kissed the sting ray - they were so Cute. Picturistic waters...
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,It's just amazing seeing stingrays fly through watera and you are standing in the middle of them. Unfortunately it was very windy when we were there and waves were really high but it was still so awesome.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We have been here many times and each time it is a thrill to swim with and hold these incredible creatures!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Loved the interesting things learned about the stingray and loved the fact we were taught how to hold one calmly and safely
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,On a Royal Caribbean cruise we stopped in the Cayman Islands and took the excursion to Sting Ray City. Having been to many places throughout the Islands we were solidly impressed by this site. Simply the best! A delightful surprise experience for all ages.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,When was the last time you help a large (4-5' wing span) stingray in your arms? Went out with Fat Fish Adventures for a more intimate experience. Stingray per capita: $5Million USD (61 Stingrays living in this area generating over $300Million USD in tourism. Staggering numbers. Hint: avoid the large group outings: boats are jammed packed (elbow room only).
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Captain Chris gave us a wonderful chapter experience. Stingray City Starfish Beach and snorkeling. Clean Boat excellent information and such a NICE hardworking man.

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Fun for everyone. Even after a few visits it's still a really cool experience to see the sting rays up close. Definitely best on a day with calm seas.

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,If you are in Grand Cayman - make sure you don´t miss Sting Ray City tour - we used Moby Dick tours and we were very happy with them.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We fed the stingrays and interacted with them. The water is so clear and it's 3-4 feet deep so you can stand on the sand. If you are not a great swimmer than this would be good for you. It was a little wavy the day we were there but no big deal. One of those "must" do experiences.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Singrays are very friendly and so much so they will knock you over when trying to get that squid in your hand. Great experience.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Shallow water feed the stingrays. Have a blast. It is the reason that we brought the kids back to Grand Cayman.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Swimming with the sting rays at stingray city is a must do. I would urge that you go on a calm day seeing as the waves make it a litte hectic. Also I would caution taking small children although many people do it.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,I've never seen my kids with bigger smiles before or since our trip to Stingray City. Our family lists this trip at the top of our bucket list completions.

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Awesome excursion to the dunes of Stingray City. I was a little nervous at first but the local guides put me right at ease and I had the time of my life frolicking about with the wild stingrays!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,This was absolutely the coolest part of our trip - swimming with stingrays that are the size of large dogs. My kids are 14 17 19 and 21 and they all loved it as did I. Definitely one of the high points of our vacation and something you cannot miss if you go to Cayman.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Stingray City (not the sandbar where snorkelers go) is a must-do novelty dive. The stingrays are so friendly and curious and actually seem to like the attention. We dove it in the afternoon with DiveTech. They took just six of us out on their large boat and we had the site pretty much to ourselves.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,I booked a snorkel boat trip with Pirate Divers to sting ray city. A really nice day feeding sting ray and having them swim right up to you and wanting to interact with us. Nice snorkel dive after with stop a rum point for dinner. Macs safe and friendly approach to the this famous site was awesome.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,While this is our 3rd trip it's never disappoints. How many places in the world can you swim kiss and feed the stingrays!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We had a late afternoon visit to Sting Ray City and it was great. All the boats with cruise ship tourist was gone so it was much quieter. We went with Six Senses Eco Tour. It was a great day and a great end being up close to these wonderful creatures.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,A first for us! Loved visiting and learning about these beautiful creatures...would have liked more than 20 minutes!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Life experience not to be missed. Eco friendly fun for all ages. Anyone can do it. All will enjoy it.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,If you're planning to go to the Caymans don't miss Sting Ray City definitely a unique place. After a 30 minute boat ride you arrive at a sandbank with a really shallow water. The number of stingrays there is unbelievable and it's even more amazing because they're all free in the nature.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,This is a must when visiting Grand Cayman. I'm so happy we did it ... it was so much fun !!!! It changed my whole perspective on stingrays. They are such gentle and amazing creatures !
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,I took my 7 and 10 year old we were all a bit frightened but once you got in it was so cool. The stingrays feel like velvet.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We went back twice in our short trip. We saw them further out on a sailboat and then closer in by motorboat. I think we enjoyed sailing more but the stingrays more by motorboat. Looking at our videos now it seems unbelievable.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,A must must do! Captain Marvin takes you out to the sand bar first and then 2 excellent snorkeling stops $45 US/pp. The experience is incredible. The staff was really helpful and friendly. Also try to go on day when the cruise liners are not in; less crowded. Even in kind of choppy water visibility is terrific.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Did this as a cruise shore excursion. We've done this before and would do it again. These wonderful stingrays are the show. So gentle it is amazing. Don't chicken out - kiss and pet them!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Loved this adventure. Really beautiful water. I enjoyed feeding the sting rays and getting in the water. I would recommend this adventure to anyone that goes to Cayman. A MUST SEE!!!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,I love this! This is the fifth time I have been and it is really amazing. The stingrays swim up all around you and sort of brush up against you like a cat. There were only three boats there on Sunday because the cruise ships were not in port.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Red Sail was so helpful on our trip Simon Josh and the rest the guys at Morritts are really helpful and highly recommended.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,You must take a boat charter to stingray city. We used Captain Marvins which was excellent. We also stopped to snorkel on the trip at 2 places Coral Gardens and the Barrier Reef. Great trip!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Experiencing stingrays was awesome. You get to play with them on the sandbar right off the island. They swim around you you can feed them squid and they suck it off your grasp. Your tour guides will have you pick up the rays and give them a kiss which is supposed to give you 7 years of good luck.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We were glad we went. We got an up close visit with stingrays. Oddly enough the site was crowded with people and boats. Again it was a great one time experience but probably wouldn't go back again. Grand Cayman has to many great snorkeling spots.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Beautiful spot to snorkel and get up close and personal with stingrays. Unforgettable experience! Can't wait to return.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,This tour was fabulous! We stopped in 3 awesome spots to snorkel. Had the opportunity to feed fish and stingrays. Such a great time! A must do for sure!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,My family are all Scuba divers but we still had a blast at Stingray City. We went with Capt. Marvin's who took us to two other snorkel sites too. The attraction is crowded but it is the highlight of any trip to the CI. Don't skip this place because you think it's too touristy. It is but it's still awesome.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,This was a great afternoon! There were so many stingrays! We held them and got some great pictures underwater of them. I would highly recommend it! My 15 year old was freaked out but stayed in the water (wouldn't hold or touch them) but overall it was a great experience.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,You will never have an experience like this on a sandbar anywhere else. A Cayman specialty for almost 30 years and best done with any one of dozens of local outfits that will provide you a very personalised experience.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Loved getting upclose and personal with the Sea Rays. Delroy with Captain Marvins is definitely the best boat to be on.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Have visited multiple times best to go with a SMALL operator early before everyone else. Don`t worry if no stingrays are there yet: They will glide in as soon as they see the boat!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We have visited the Cayman Islands several times and we always visit Stingray City. We always have a great experience as do our kids. You can swim with touch and feed the stingrays. It is a once in a lifetime experience. My favorite place to visit.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,A must for every traveler to Grand Cayman! The stingrays are so much more than I ever imagined. What a experience that I will remember for my entire life.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,This is a great experience for all ages! Water was beautiful and calm. Our guide was very informative and helpful.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Awesome - well worth it - take Red Sail from Rum Point - do the sand bar with little kids - avoid days with heavy cruise ship traffic
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Sting Ray City is a must see when going to the Caymans. Water is shallow and clear and the sting rays are big friendly and beautiful. We got to hold the sting rays and feed them. We went during Christmas week so it was not crowded...Had a great time.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,A must do in Cayman Island; one of a kind and unique experience. Look at booking with White Sand Water Sports in the East End based out of Reef Resort. You will not be disappointed; however be sure to book the 7am outing. Sting Ray City gets busy as the day goes on.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,This is definitely worthwhile. The guides are knowledgable and there is no fear of being stung. The water is waste deep sandy bottom. The rays are curious and beautiful. This is a must-do!!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Super awesome time petting stingrays.. totally surreal experience. Loved it! Would highly recommend this tour to others.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,What a unique experience. I SCUBA dive but but I can never have this much fun with the wildlife. Yes I kissed a stingray!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We did this many years ago probably about 10. We took our girls to Cayman for a week and immediately booked this. It's such an amazing place to check out. I do worry about touching the wildlife but it's an interactive wild life zone designee.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,I live here in Grand Cayman for 7years and I can't get enough of this place. Love swim with stingrays and snorkeling in Cayman is just amazing experience.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Definitely take the sunrise tour with Chris at White Sands Sports if you can. It was unforgettable. Free shuttle from our hotel and the snorkeling after the sting rays was a lot of fun too.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,stingray city is one of the most incredible places at the grand Cayman Islands to visit. I booked through a local agent and we took a Jetski to stingray city and too starfish Island it was the funnest time ever !
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Our family of five adults was quite positively overwhelmed by the experience. The stingrays come right up to you and feed from your hands swim around you gently into you looking for food. It could not have been more impressive.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,I guess you have to do this once but that's enough. If you're 10 this would be great. It was just too crowded. 500 people packed into a small area.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Feed pet and play with the StingRays. Kiss one for 7 years good luck. We have snorkeled many reefs throughout the caribbean and this unique experience is not to be missed
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We booked this tour through RCCL in early November. The crew members on the Caymen Explorer with MarineLand Tours were great. They delivered a very informative and fun tour. We would do this tour again in a minute!!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,If you have never touched a stingray this is your chance. What a fabulous experience with our Captain Dexter who safely escorted us on his lovely catamaran and helped us feed kiss hold and swim with these amazing creatures. My teenagers were equally enthralled.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Everything it is hyped up to be and more. The sting rays swim right up and rub against you. The suck the squid right out of your hands when feeding them. We booked through Red Sail Sports and the guides were great!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We went out here with Aquarious Tours. Our captain Mario was very informative and fun. The stingrays were so friendly I never thought I would pick one up but when I saw everyone else doing it I was okay with it. They feel a lot like dolphins.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,This is once in a lifetime experience to interact with the sting rays in the middle of the ocean was awesome. They swim all around you and you get to interact with them in their own habitat.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,and our Captain (the L.C. at Georgetown Yacht Club) could not have been better...but there were WAAAY too many people on our boat....including at least 8 children under 5 2 of whom were in baby carriages.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We had a great time on a combined scuba /snorkel trip. The stingrays were fun to swim with and love to play. If you have a chance go visit!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Good time. Chance to see touch and interact with some amazing creatures. Def a must see if you're visiting Grand Cayman. :)
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We chartered with Captain Marvins who has been an snorkel/dive operator on Grand Cayman since the 1950's. Other people have said the same thing sporty cool that you can interactive with these gentle (at least on the surface) inquisitive sea creatures. Our daughter Lindsey touched her first at Sting Ray City almost 19 years ago in 1996.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We went to Sting Ray City with Ocean Frontiers on a sunrise trip--spent 90 minutes in the water having an amazing adventure. The animals are absolutely astounding to see and feel up close. They are as friendly as puppies especially since our guide Lois was feeding them pieces of squid. The highlight of our trip.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,But so not! It's a little disconcerting to step into a swarm of stingrays but once you've held one the panic subsides. Not only are they extremely friendly but they seem to recognize crew members & actually greet them! The Islanders have named them which is sweet.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Best adventure over all. You must try it. There was a two yr. old on our tour and he loved it. Fun for all ages.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,plentiful "friendly" stingrays warm water choppy during our visit but shallow rays are obviously not coerced into interaction but do enjoy the treats!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Up close and great photo opportunities. Pick times when no cruise ships are in for less people. Great snorkeling also available within a few hundred yards as well.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,If you've never been here its awesome. Get to see feed and touch stingrays up close and personal This was our 2nd time. I think there are way to many people out there at a time.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Went out for an excursion with the stingrays at Grand Cayman. The water was a little rough but the boat operator got us in close enough to enjoy feeding and swimming with the stingrays.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Probably one of the best experiences I have ever had. The staff was friendly and very informative. It was beyond my expectations.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Wow what a good time. Swimming and petting stingrays. Not very crowded and was a mile or 2 out in the ocean. Great excursion  took lots of pictures really a positive experience.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,I strongly recommend Stingray City be your most important stop on Grand Cayman. The rays come up to your hands you can lift them up and engage in an encounter like nowhere. There are many different tour companies that give you this experience but do make it part of your trip
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Highly recommend for people because you don't need any skills to interact with the rays. You just jump in water and enjoy the creatures which you can also feed. Only thing too many boats day we were there.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,This was our second time it's one of our favorite excursions! The guides are very knowledgable and help you relax. They pick the stingray up and let you hold it kiss it or just pet it It's amazing having a stingray swim past your leg or over your feet. I highly recommend this to all my customers! Effortless2Travel.com
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Can't get enough of it... Is an almost mandatory trip every month. Clear waters stingrays are so use to people that you can easily pet them.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Now it is just overrun with cruise ship passengers. Very crowded and rushed. The guides all do an excellent job but it's not like it used to be...

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Just hate it how this word is over used however its just great to be with these wonderful creatures. Usually it will be an organised trip. So if you get the chance to do it its a must. Consider a waterproof camera case. Our guide was charging $50 A set of pix.

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Been to stingray city several times and it is incredible. All the stingrays are very friendly. We took a tour with Marvinsso there were not alot of people on board and in the middle of the week so there was not alot of cruiseships that day. A MUST SEE!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Best to visit when there aren't too many ships in port can get vey crowded. Such a neat place to visit and the rays are so docile and lovable! A lot of fun! I suggest captain Marvin's excursions here great quality price and overall experience with them yiu can't go wrong!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,While this might seem a bit touristy nevertheless standing in waist-high water while numerous stingrays swim right up to you is just a very special experience. They are safe and friendly. The water is gorgeous. Loved it!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Went on a cruise excursion. We enjoyed ourselves. Especially my ten year old. She loved hugging the rays.

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,I was a little spectical of the trip but after I got over my fear of being surrounded by 100 of string rays it was a lot of fun and they take photos so you have great memorys of the trip
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,This was the highlight of our trip! The stingrays were so curious about us and we snorkled as well. I hired a private charter for our family through captain Marvin's and I highly recommend
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,up close and personal with the stingrays. Safe to experience and one of a kind experience. By boat or skidoo ride.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,It was so much fun I laughed the whole time because of my husband and friends. We really enjoyed getting to know the stingrays upclose

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Absolutely fantastic trip out to swim and interact with the stingrays. When the weather is calm and sunny it is just stunning being in the beautiful clear Aqua blue waters which are normally up to waist height. I would highly recommend going out with Captain Marvin's for the 1/2 day trip which also includes two snorkel stops.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Excellent trip my children loved it. Good for all ages. Something different. Went with Captain Marvin's which were excellent tour very friendly staff.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,If you like stingrays or nature this is something for you! You get an experience and some education to boot while inadvertently helping to fund and preserve an ecosystem through eco-tourism!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Great experience and the water is so clear and blue! Absolutely beautiful! The stingrays were slimy but really cool to snorkel around them. Definitely not a place to miss.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Unfortunately just by the nature of the excursion you will not be the only visitor. Plan on a lot of people there but exciting none the less
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,This is something everyone should do while visiting Grand Cayman. Feeding and mingling with the stingrays is amazing.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Great experience. Definitely not to be missed. Really good for young kids as well since sand shelf very shallow
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,This is a MUST do! Make sure to check out Captain Shaun at Seven Seas Charters. Beat the cruise tours there with Cpt Shaun for the best interaction with the stingrays.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Although a "touristy" activity it's simply awesome. We booked thru red sail and did the catamaran and loved it. Staff was very helpful. To swim around with those beautiful stingrays in crystal clear water is something that everyone should try.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Great boat trip great captain clean and nice boat with a bathroom! From snorkeling going to Stingray City seeing starfish diving for conch and eating marinated conch we could not have had a better experience with anyone else! Our best charter fishing experience ever! Thanks Danirl and Double Trouble!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,A little uncomfortable at first but with the right tour guide they will help make you feel comfortable.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Awesome place its the most popular tourist spot on the island but its worth it! if you can book with Cpt Marvin's afternoon trip you may be able to beat the cruise ship rush!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Took this adventure with Ocean Frontiers Dive Shop. Amazing experience with the rays. Held them in my arms like a baby. They all have different personalities. Lois our skipper and guide was excellent. 6 on the boat as opposed to many sardines when cruise ship excursions.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We took a tour with a small group of 6 in the early morning. The stingrays heard our boat and came running for squid treats! Take a small tour rather than the push pull big ones. It's way more personalized.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,You must get out there totally worth it. The rays are very friendly don't let one man's experience with a wild one cloud your judgement on these very friendly blind puppy like fat creatures
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,This was a beautiful place to visit! None of the rays are in pens etc. They in the ocean and are wild animals yet are used to people and take on a very friendly persona. I am so happy that I had the chance to experience Stingray City and would recommend it to all my friends
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,a must do attraction. our trip included this site plus 2 snorkel sites nearby. saw another group arriving on jet skis and that looked lik it would've been a fun way to get there and back.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We had three couples with us and Red Sail does a great job in the Cayman's with all types of adventures. Not the cheapest on the Island but the best!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,So awesome to get to swim with stingrays! They are friendly and soft and there are about 100 swimming in this area. Go here!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We had so much fun at Stingray city even though my mom freaked out because she doesn't know how to swim...but most of us in my group had fun really really A MUST to see while you are in the cayman island.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,One of several places that are tourist stops unlike any thing else in the world and a must do in the Caymans!!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,this was soooo much fun!!! we did the sandbar trip which also offered the two snorkeling sites. i would recommend just doing the stingray city sandbar and not the snorkeling since the water was a little choppy by the reef and the reef wasn't that colorful. stingrays were so fun!!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,I was initially hesitant about this tour but am glad I did it. Amazing tour and very helpful crew. Had a wonderful time and was the best tour we did.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Highlight of our vacation. This was an awesome excursion. Easy on and off the boat. Very knowledgeable staff. Great for adult non-swimmers. Also a great first time snorkel experience. Absolutely Loved the Sting Rays!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We had a good time on this excision. We got to take a lot of pictures and hold the stingrays. Hope I get my 7 years good luck for getting my pic taken kissing one of those rays. And the back rub was pretty cool too
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We did not know how to swim. We were told that we just walked into the water and played with sting ray. However the boat docked on the deep side. We could not get in the water. I expressed disappointment to the tour company and we were credited one part. It's nice that they cared of customers.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Sting Ray City requires transportation by boat to reach. It's an area offshore where boats once dropped unwanted fish parts. Sting rays learned to frequent there. Now they are accustomed to tourists and can be touched held or fed squid. Guides explain and demonstrate how.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Wonderful to be with the Sting Rays even if it is all a bit artificial. Yet the animals ARE in their own habitat rather than in pools (as is true in Sea World for example). They are quite amazing animals. Learned much during the short visit
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,You dive in about 12-15' of water and get to feed stingrays. If conditions are right you will have up to 30 stingrays to feed and enjoy.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Just did my 3rd trip to Sting Ray City. Always a blast! The rays seem to be friendlier than ever. If you are comfortable being in the water this is probably the must-do tour if you have limited time on Grand Cayman.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Highly recommend it for kids and adults. The rays are amazingly gentle and curious. Getting the chance to feed and interact with rays in the wild is and amazing opportunity.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Taking a boat out to Sting Ray City is a must if visiting Grand Cayman. There are numerous tours groups to use. You get to interact with the Sting rays. The water is about chest deep. Once you get over your fears it can be amazing.

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,I learned a lot about Stingrays. They swam up to me and laid out on my outstretched arms. Was able to feed them right out of my hand. A very friendly fish.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Travelled with Acquarius Sea Tours. Loved being in the ocean surrounded by sting rays and interacting with them. The tour provider was excellent
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Love to just sit and watch the rays move and saw them eat. watch people swim with them. the visit was worth the visit.

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,My husband & son traveled to Stingray City as an excursion during our recent cruise. While my 10 year old son was a little freaked out by the stingrays & the water was a little deep for him my husband thought it was awesome!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Don't miss this amazing experience in Cayman... well worth the time and money. Probably our most memorable vacation experience ever.

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,How many people can say they swam with stingrays? This was an incredible experience and one I would gladly repeat if I ever had the chance. 1/2 hour boat ride to the sand bar then jump right in and have the time of your life. Kiss a ray for 7 years good luck.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Beautiful boat ride out to the "stingray city" area in the ocean. The workers were funny and friendly. I couldn't believe how "friendly" the stingrays were and we even got to feed them and take pictures with them! Pictures were a little expensive (the only downfall I'd say) but the whole experience was worth it :)

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,To see all those stingrays and beautiful fish in one place that's dominated by people all day is amazing. This is our second visit to Stingray City and likely won't be our last!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,You will not regret Stingray City. Find a smaller boat to get more time with the stingrays. You will be surprised how soft and gentle they are. Nothing to be afraid of. Most boats have snorkel stops and equipment included.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We have been there on 2 separate cruise stops and would go 10 more times! We used the company "Kelly's tours" and they are AWESOME. Very friendly staff and make the whole trip very pleasurable and fun!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,I really enjoyed the stingrays swimming around. I even got to feed one!!!! I liked that there was a professional photographer along because I got to enjoy the adventure without worrying about taking pictures and then bought the pictures later. Beautiful day and awesome stingrays
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Remember to bring your squid and watch your fingers. They'll suck the squid right out of your fist. Plenty of rays and great photo opportunities. Get there early before the cruise ships if you want just rays and not people in your photos.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Great afternoon. Stingrays come right up to you. The stingrays are friendly. Some of the trips also take you to 2 other snorkel stops. You can't see Cayman without seeing what it has under the ocean.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We did the Stingray City. It was so beautiful there. I cannot explain the beauty of the water and the stingrays were so cool! We had an amazing day on the crystal clear blue water. We did not want to leave! Something you have to do if you go to Grand Cayman!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We went on the Stingray city and beach excursion and it was the most amazing time . we went to the sandbar on the African Gray and the crew was great. We will do this again .
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Booked this tour on a recent Carnival Cruise and following a recommendation would certainly recommend to any one including non swimmers (such as myself). Taken out by boat to the clearest water and sandbar to spend time with the most gentle creatures and feed them. A must do on anyone's "bucket list"!!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,In 10/2013 we visited Sting Ray City and Rum Point Beach via cruise excursion. Unique experience clear water great tour saw lots of rays fish conch shell. I definitely recommend to do this at least once.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Such a fun exciting adventurous experience. Of course it was a little scary at first but once you convince yourself that your safe if you just listen to the guides advice you will have a blast!!

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Loved these gentle sea creatures.. we swam and played with them in their environment... Beautiful crystal clear water..the guides showed us how to hold them and feed... awesome experience..
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Don't miss this! I love stingrays. We've done this attraction many times over the last 12 years. We can't get enough. These are wonderful gentle creatures. Don't let the media scare you. This is a MUST experience while you are on Grand Cayman.

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,While some on our excursion got a bit squeamish in the waters if you listen to the guides it is a really cool experience. I can hear Sue laughing out loud when the first big ray swept by and then began its beautiful side roll past us. Memories of a lifetime. Glad we went.

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,I can't imagine not being entertained at least a little you would have to be a pretty poor sport to not have a good time here. Everyone had a blast it's one thing the wife and I have always remembered doing. Would do it again too.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Loved the 'people friendly' sting rays! They swim right up to you and they're so soft and beautiful. Watch from the boat if you're afraid of them because having someone flailing about seems to get them tense. I'd go again!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We went on a small tour that left from the Holiday Inn Resort dock. We had about an hour plus snorkeling and slightly less time feeding and petting the rays. The two crew members clearly enjoyed the reef and the stingrays. What a great afternoon we had.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,I have been here about five different times and have always enjoyed it as I see different reaction from the visitors from happy and excited too being scared and crying I always was careful and followed the instructions remember once you no longer have the food for them they won't get that close too hou

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,The stingray city trip was the best experience of our trip. It is by far the best attraction the island has to offer! Make sure you kiss the stingrays for seven years of good luck.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,It was so surreal to touch feel lift these friendly fishes. I went there with the Six senses eco tour.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,This was a wonderful experience with our kids. Pleasent boat ride out to the Stingrays. Once there jump on out and swim over to your guide and you are able to feed and enjoy the Rays. A great way to spend the day in Grand Cayman.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,took the allure catamaran to stingray city. great crew. great photos. lots of fun. very safe. never though stingrays were lovable until this excursion. dont miss it.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,You travel out in a boat to a place where the stingray congregate. The guides are very respectful of the animals and make sure that it is upheld by the swimmers. The ray are huge and freaked me out! They swim through your ankles and slither up your back...
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,It's remarkable to feed and play with stingrays. Be ready because these creatures do love to give you a big kiss.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,you really have to see this to believe it. the whole experience is some what scary. these stingrays are about 4 feet wide and they just keep coming . you can feed them from your hand if you wish. Not to be missed.

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,I've been 2 times to stingray city at Grand Cayman. This place is fantastic to meet this amazing animal. There are a lot of bad thing says on stingray but at the end this is an animal that is friendly and gentle with humans. This activity is a must to do in a lifetime.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,It is best done on scuba everything gets up close and personal Sign up with the crew from Dive Tec they do a great trip try to get Deb she is a lot of fun and gets everyone involved
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,best 13ft dive I ever did!!!! I would recommend this over the snorkeling because you get a better time with the stingrays as far as feeding and swimming with them
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We went to Stingray Bay on an excursion through Carnival. The water is absolutely clear and the perfect temperature. The guides do an excellent job of explaining that stingrays are NOT dangerous for those who are afraid. I would definitely do this again!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Water was crystal clear and the guide was very friendly! They took pics with our cameras and helped us feed the stingrays.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Family vacation just got another forever memory. Stingray city is a must see to believe such an amazing thing to feed a wild animal that has just over 30 40 years have really found a good thing with a family outing to believe just go
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We went to Stingray Bay as a excursion from our Carnival Cruise. We had the best experience. The Charter Crew were very knowledgeable and accommodating. The water was warm and the perfect height to enjoy the stingrays. This was our fourth excursion on our cruise and was by far the most memorable. Well worth the price.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Very enjoyable. I had a good tour guide. The water was clear and warm. The stingrays don't bite. They won't hurt you.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Got to go to Rum Point catch a ride out to Sting Ray City and enjoy the wildlife. Be sure to head up the road and check out Starfish Point.

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,The stingrays are free to come and go. They're not sad and trapped in a pen. They are beautiful. We came up and there were a lot of boats. I thought "Oh well they're all full. We won't get to pet any." WRONG! The stingrays swim from boat to boat all day.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Being able to touch the stingrays in their natural environment is an incredible experience. A MUST DO in Grand Cayman. Make sure your trip to Stingray City also offers snorkeling opportunities.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We had a fantastic triple trip which included playing and feeding the stingrays on Captain Marvin’s. The staff was very professional and friendly. We also went on a reef to snorkel and a spot with lots of fish and got some great picture with feeding them squid
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,My wife and I and another couple took a shore excursion from Carnival Cruiselines to this attraction. HIGHLY enjoyable and a must for anyone visiting Grand Cayman. Check the excursion before you arrive to ensure you get one of the better-rated companies to take you out. There were some pretty rickety overcrowded boats out there.

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,I was skeptical as it seemed so touristy but it really was the highlight of our trip. Go when cruise ships are not in town and head out early if possible. When we went only 2 boats were at the site and it was amazing. Kids and adults loved it. Memorable.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Fun safe and a great learning experience. Having done it twice I'd greatly recommend this to anyone of almost any age.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Scary at first but ended up holding a sting ray and feeding. Boat crew were helpful in overcoming fears and assuring us we were not in danger. Loved the snorkel stop included in the trip too! It was a very neat experience!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We went to Stingray City an offshore sandbar where stingrays congregate in water that is only about 3 feet deep with Red Sail Sports. The Catamaran was comfortable and smooth and the staff did a great job explaining why the stingrays were there.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,So much fun to see these animals up close. They were everywhere and the water is so clear. The reef is only 200 yards from the stingrays so you can go snorkeling after seeing the stingrays. Don't skip rum point as well.

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Unbelievable experience with wild stingrays. I went in thinking we were going to a "touristy" spot. No! It's in the middle of the ocean and you are hanging out with beautiful wild stingrays. Our boat took us and had fresh squid to feed them. Amazing experience for all ages.

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,You have to try this place family friendly and if you have reservations about being in the water don't. At any time you are only ion 2 to 3 feet of water. bring an underwater camera with you and it will be the best pictures you've ever captured on a trip.....
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,A once in a lifetime experience. A must for all visitors to Grand Cayman. Lots of available tours-recommend Stingray Sailing. Don't miss it!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Went to sting ray city with Red Sail sports along with reef snorkel Well run not as touristy as expected Despite being careful i did get a little nip on small finger from one of the rays.. guess they thought i was lunch!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,My group and I throughly enjoyed stingray city. We chose to go with Moby Dick tours. If you decide to go make sure to bring q waterproof pouch for your phone to take pictures !

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We traveled with Red Sail. It was a beautiful and humbling experience to be with the Sting Rays. We were one with nature. The return sunset sail with the rum punch topped a perfect experience.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Great trip and would use these guys again. Attention is very personal and these guys know what they are doing. They stopped on the way back to get a starfish.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We loved everything about this experience. Beautiful boat wonderful crew. We will definitely be doing this again. Keep up the good work guy! :) ♡
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Spent 36 years dragging my feet wading through the muddy Mississippi sound waters of the Mississippi gulfcoast afraid of stepping on a stingray. After the Stingray City dive I see them as the beautiful graceful creatures that the are! A must do for any diver!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Best attraction ever. Stingray come right to you like a dog looking for a treat. Very friendly and a unique experience. A must !
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,I recently went to Stingray City and was completely disappointed by this experience. There were hundred of people there and while it was certainly entertaining and unique it was SO OVERRATED!! I wouldn't recommend going and my snorkeling experience in Cayman was 100 times better than this overrated tourist trap.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We (mehusband two teenagers) booked this with Ocean Frontiers. It was just us and our guide James. What an awesome time we had!!! He was very nice and very informative. The stingrays were so gentle and reminded us of cats the way they just came up and rubbed against us. We hated to leave there! So fun and awesome!

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Took a private boat tour with Sun Rays Tours and it was awesome! Be careful you don't book an excursion with one of the tour boat "busses". We saw a double decker tour boat pull up when we were there with around 100 people on it and I don't know how anyone would get to pet even one.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We went with acquarius tours. Those guys are the best! They care about the sealife. We held the rays fed them and even kissed them!! This is a must do if you come to Cayman Islands!!!!

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,neat experience to feed the sting-rays. they are gently and used to being feed and touched very friendly.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,This turned out to be better than I expected. Seeing the sting rays up close is one thing but we were able to interact with them (e.g. hold them swim with them & feed them). Choose the right guide and it is worth the trip.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,This was the most awesome spot we stopped at on our vacation. This is absolutely the most wonderful encounter you could possibly have with stingrays. They were so friendly. My daughter was able to hold one in her arms. They interact with you like you have been there the whole time.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We attended a snorkeling + stingray tour and it was perfect. It was a gorgeous day outside and I loved every minute of it! Hopefully soon I can go back Grand Cayman was beautiful! I attached some pictures for a better understanding.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,While on our Disney Cruise this was my favourite excursion! The experience was incredible and I highly recommend it! For all the other Geocachers out there; a virtual cache is available at Stingray City as well.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,If you are in Grand Cayman you must go!! I recommend taking an excursion with locals and not thru heavily booked cruise ship excursions. Fat Fish Adventures Jet Skis is what we did.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,I would highly recommend! The water was perfect and the sandbar offers even the youngest visitor a chance to interact with the stingrays.

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Awesome a must! My daughter wants to go again on our next trip. We used Moby Dick Tours and took a old school bus to our boat and it had 2 RV A/C units that didn't put out hardly any AC. We had the slowest boat on the ocean but the guys were nice.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,good snorkeling with many other oceanic creatures great interaction with stingrays the aquatic adventure is a great experience for new and slightly non-ocean adventurers.

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Stingray City is an amazing place! You are standing on a sandbar in the middle of the ocean cuddling a stingray! The velvet belly of the docile creature can't be understood until you've experienced it. Of course there are folks who keep trying to take and sell you pictures. Take a disposable waterproof camera and make your own.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We went to Stingray City when there were no boats in port. This makes a big difference. We were able to enjoy the rays without the boatload of people. This is a tour not to miss when visiting Cayman Islands see my blog at winenchocolate dot com

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Caption Clinton's snorkeling/stingray tour was the best ever! Having been to Cayman 3 times I would recommend this trip. Very friendly with the kids even let them "drive" the boat!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,The ability to be up close & personal with the stingrays was the coolest part. Crossed something off my bucket list!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,My wife and I did this tour in February of this year and had a blast. The rays come right up to you. It's kinda fun to watch a few people freak out but the rays are harmless for the most part.

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We went with "Captain Marvin" to Stingray City. We all had so much fun. Very cool touching a stingray. They've been tamed by daily human visitors. A trip not to be missed#
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We visited Stingray Sandbar with Fat Fish Adventures. Its a must do particularly on days when few cruise ships are in port. Stingrays were very gentle and our guide did a great job teaching us about them and how to handle them in the appropriate way. A must do!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,My daughter and husband loved the trip. Don't buy it from the cruise line you can get it much cheaper after you get off the boat. This is a must do
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We took our 5 year old to the sandbar to snorkel with Ocean Frontiers. Our Capt. and guide James was superb. Everyone had a great time. If possible I would recommend going on a light cruise ship day. Our trip left on a fri. at 9 am. Money well spent!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Second time used Red Sail to go out to Stingray City - completely recommend the professional and friendly crew!!!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We couldn't believe how warm and clear the water was. And the stingrays were milling around us like puppies. A lot of fun when not overcrowded with boats.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Swimming with Rays was an incredible experience it's something I highly recommend to anyone iffy about trying it. Our tour was great and got some perfect photos at a reasonable price. Truly a once in a lifetime type of adventure. Oh and make sure you have a little squid or seafood on you causes for a fun little feeding frenzy!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,I live in Cayman and we go on a stingray city tour with all our visitors. Stingray City is such a unique attraction plus you get to see the beautiful water of the Caribbean! No visitor of our has regretted swimming with the stingrays! Stingrays are very domesticated and friendly. It is safe and very unique. Highly recommend.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,If you are going to spend time in Grand Cayman you must see Stingray City! It is important that you go with a reputable operator. Some of the operators are dangerous with their boats and some are disrespectful to the stingrays. Do your research.

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,300 plus people descend from about 15 boats native hawkers pick up the rays and wipe them over tourists others wave cameras and order people in or out of the shot they are about to take; the whole thing is odd and unpleasant
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,This is a must for anyone visiting the island. These docile creatures will eat out of your hand! Holding a ray was one of the highlights of our 4-stop cruise.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,This was awesomewe did the early booking and it was worth cause we got to hold the stingraykiss and we got tons of pictures very fun and definitely a must do!!!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,A must do if you travel to Grand Cayman Island. Either by boat or jet ski you arrive in the crystal clear waters of sting ray city and can swim snorkle hold and feed the sting rays.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Went to Stingray City with a Carnival Cruise excursion. It is a must see. The local tour operators are very respectful of the stingrays. It is not often you get a chance to feed a stingray. My teenage girls really enjoyed it.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,This is a 100% must do if you visit Grand Cayman. Unbelievable interaction with the stingrays. Make sure to buy an underwater camera for great photos.

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,If you don't mind huge stingrays swimming around you then I definitely recommend going to see them. Awesome experience.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We enjoyed stingray city for the second time. First time on a cruise ship and this time staying on the island.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We went with Captain Byran which I found through Island Marketing. The water was crystal clear and the stingrays were not in an enclosure. The water was about 3 feet deep-just perfect. The stingrays swam between our legs and rubbed against our legs gave us a kiss and a back rub. I would highly recommend Stingray City!!!!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Wonderful educational trip. I would advise going early in the morning or on a day when there are no or few cruise ships. Find a company like White Sands or Ocean Frontiers who only take out 8 to 10 people at a time. That way you can truly enjoy the rays beauty. Will do this trip again!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Not sure that I cared to watch the Stingrays being man-handled. Also very expensive for a few hours.

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Definitely worth it ... the boat ride to the location was wonderful then the sting rays were amazing. We also stopped to snorkel with a variety of fish on the way back including star fish point. Don't miss this!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,This is the closest I've been to real wild sea life. Stingrays are the creapiest animals and you get as close as possible in feeding and handling them. It's really a special experience.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Had a great time holding the Stingrays and swimming with the Dolphins. Our visit Es very well organized and spent a lot of time with the critters. Would recommend to for others to do.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,I held a stingray. It was so amazing. Lots of boats were there but Paul with Seven Senses made sure we understood the animals and held them carefully. We took photos played in the water with them. It is a must-do!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,They are the island pets. So amazing and an absolute incredible adventure. This is a must if visiting the island. We went by jet ski with Action Water Sports. They were so informative and helpful. Great experience!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,It was great getting up close with the beautiful stingrays! Also being in the waist deep water made the experience so much fun! We also had fun feeding them squid from our hand. I would enjoy coming back to Sting Ray City again in the future!

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,No visit to Grand Caymen is complete without a visit to Stingray City to 'meet the mayor'! It's an incredible experience. Thanks to Captain Mario and Acquarius Sea Tours for giving us a wonderful day!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Try to go on a day that the cruise ships are not in as the sandbar gets crowded. If you are in Grand Cayman this attraction is a must. Water is clear so even if you are not thrilled about interacting with the stingrays you can watch them from the boat.

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,The highlight of our cruise. We still talk about the day we swam with these beautiful creatures. A definite must on any vacation awesome.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Amazing way to get up close and personal with the stingrays. Wonderful opportunity to take some great shallow water photos.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,The stingrays are very friendly and the water is an incredible shade of blue crystal clear. Lots of fun to pet and feed the rays. A must do when in the islands.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,It was so amazing to swim with them! They are soft and gentle. My guide was able to catch them and hand them to you for your kiss!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Playing with the sting rays was unforgettable but there is a lot more to see besides. Take your snorkelling gear and expect to see an incredible variety of sea life big and small.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,It was fantastic getting the change to interact with such beautiful creatures. I would recommend this experience to anyone. I hope to visit again soon.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Going to sting ray city is a beautiful experience. I took my 1 year old son many years ago and we returned again this year The stingrays are the most beautiful creatures on earth. Velvet shy creatures which let you stroke them and even suck your fingers An experience you cannot miss ever
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Our kids have never tired of this experience even now as teenagers...always special. Front desk will make arrangements for you!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Really this is an exceptional chance to interact with these amazing creatures. Your in their environment with guides that are experienced and very capable of handling the stingrays. Your very safe and it really is a lot of fun.

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We visited Stingray City while on a cruise and it was the best part of our trip!!! We booked the trip/excursion with a local tour group and had a blast! Our guide was very funny and knowledgeable. We only paid 130 for 4 people! Such a great deal for such a beautiful experience. Don't leave Grand Cayman without going here!!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Booked this tour with Discount Excursions & it was amazing! So cool to be up close & personal with sting rays. We even got to hold feed & kiss them.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,This is a must do....older kids didn't really want to go...thought it would be boring. All were surprised on how neat this experience was. You cannot miss this part of a trip to Grand Cayman.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Coming to cayman on not visiting Stingray City is a true pity. It is a once in a lifetime experience. Can't get any closer to nature.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Our second time and the kids still say this is their favorite thing to do in GC. Rays are gentle and friendly. Go early to avoid crowds. We went with Marvin's and did the three stop snorkeling tour.

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Great fun. We did it scuba. You get to play with the rays when you do it scuba. A lot of fun. Not to be missed if you are a diver. We went with Red Sail which is a great dive operation. Highly recommended!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,If you want to get up and friendly with the stingray this is going to be your favorite place. It's a crazy experience and tons of fun.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Wow!!!! did excursion via royal Caribbean. Absolutely beautiful area Crystal clear warm water and lots of rays to look and touch. Well worth the 40 minute boat ride to get there.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Took a catamaran out to stingray city (which is about 2 km off the coast). The water is not too deep and they even took us out to the reef to snorkel a bit afterwards. Amazing trip great reef and fish to see and you get to interact with the stingrays. Great experience would do it again in a heartbeat.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,You get to swim safely with the stingrays in the sea- a wow experience! It was a bit expensive but well worth the visit

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Our family just got back from a 7 night cruise that took us to various islands. One of those islands was Grand Cayman. We took an excursion to Stingray city and loved it. It was great for our 6 year old daughter as well as us adults. So much fun and educational as well.

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We decided to dive (a whole 15-20') instead of stand in shallow water with a crowd. This was wonderful. We just stayed on the bottom and feed squid to the stingrays. Must use Deep Blue Divers.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Don't miss this. Its the experience of a lifetime. I recommend using Aquarius Sea Tours. Captain Mario is the best and took us to Stingray City Coral Gardens Reef and Starfish Beach. If you do nothing else here do this tour!

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Went on a charter from the Carnival Magic. Wonderful trip great crew and boat. Stingray City was awesome. Very shallow even for my son and wife. Felt very safe water was clear stingrays everywhere!! Was one of the best parts of our vacation.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,A great place to interact with stingrays in their native environment. You can stand in the ocean and the stingrays swim all around you. You can even feed them.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,The water is beautiful warm and clear. The stingrays are tame and it's a once in a lifetime kind of adventure. Loved it!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We took the sunrise trip to the stingray sandbar with Ocean Frontiers. This is the only way to go to the sandbar. 6 people and 1 guide and an ocean full of stringrays. We were the only people there for over an hour. Amazing!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,This is a must do while in Grand Cayman. Nothing else like it. The Six Senses Eco Tour is the best! Stay away from the larger tour companies.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Absolutely awesome experience! I've snorkeled on stingray excursions before but not like this these rays are wild not netted in and he most friendly creatures! As soon as I got into the water one large ray swam right up the front of me! It was amazing!! Will definitely do this again and again and again!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Was super nice big sandbar in the ocean. Clear blue water with big and small stingrays. Got to hold pet and feed them. The rays were friendly. Wish we could have stayed longer. Great place to visit. Go when the cruise ships leave in the afternoon which is when it is less crowded.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,They get right up close and personal with you! In their natural environment and not in a tank which makes it worth it! Very much enjoyed it.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,At first I was very nervous. But im so glad we listened to the other reviewers. We booked our excursion via the cruise ship that we were on. It wasn't too bad of a price. The whole experience was just amazing. Cant wait to bring my family here one day to swim with the stingrays.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,If you are here and visiting this area you have to check it out. I wrote a review on a local company that does trips that is amazing. Searching for CARIB SELECT Stingray city Grand Cayman here on trip advisor. Amazing crew that will look after you.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Too touristy for me - although it was billed as a quite trip to see the stingrays we were there with at least 7 other boat loads. Probably around 90-100 people all in all. Would be more than happy to skip.

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We visited Stingray City as part of the Six Senses Eco Tour...they do this portion of the tour after the crowds have left so you get all the rays to yourself.

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Plenty of Stingrays to see. I recommend Sixth Sense Eco Tour to get there. It's a must see if you're visiting the Grand Caymans.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,The stingrays are huge but gentle! We got to feed them touch them and the Red Sail Sports folks did a great job holding them for us to interact with. Captain Warren kept our camera on board the boat and took lots of pictures of us with the rays. Great memories!

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,My wife and I dove with the Eagle Rays of Stingray City about 20 years ago. My logbook has over 50 dives and this place remains one of my all-time favorite dive experiences.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,The sting rays rub up against your legs like a cat. If you have not done this I highly recommend it.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We booked a sunset excursion through Red Sail and thoroughly enjoyed it. To get to snorkel around hold and feed these amazing creatures was truly a treat and the RSS crew could not have been more warm professional and fun.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Swore I would never do this. Did it and had a blast! Have friends take pictures of you. The tours charge too much.

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,This is one of the best things to do on the island. These stingrays are huge and beautiful!! Also great snorkling spot.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Great to see the stingray in their natural habitat. Water only came up to your waist and it was sandy underfoot which helped me being a non swimmer. Tour guide from the cater-am was knowledgeable and friendly you were able to feed and hold them
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,String Ray City is a must visit on your visit to Grand Caymon . In the past the experience was in water that you needed fins snorkel and mask. Now the experience is on a sandbar that is waste high. Wish that I had booked snorkeling sites also. That would have been a more complete experience.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Went to Sting Ray City with Red Sail Breakfast with the Rays. No better way or time. We got there early and had a lot of room to experience the rays who are very friendly and loving. Loved this place. Be advised go early Red Sail and not later. Try and go when the cruise ships are not in port.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,My child said it was awesome and I enjoyed it so kid friendly. I had a great time I defiantly recommend it.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Omg the water here us spool pretty and people seem very friendly. We went on a cruise and here wad 1 of our stops. We stayed back in 2001. Not 2013
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,This was one of my favorite things to do on Cayman! They Stingrays come right to you and you have nothing to fear! They are soft and very gentle!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We did this as a shore excursion when we were on a cruise. Initially my daughter was not going to do this was so scared didn't want to touch them well she ended up kissing a stingray. They are so soft so gentle and the guides were so patient and informative. We got some great pictures. Would definitely go back
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We have been to Stingray City 5 times and it just never gets old. It is always fun and enjoyable. There's just something about swimming around in the middle of the Caribbean Sea with these gentle creatures.

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Absolute must experience regardless of your level of fear. These creatures are pets and surround you and caress you and beg to be held and kissed! These are memories you and your kids will have forever.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,I was a bit frightened about this adventure but it is definitely worth it. The stingrays are gentle many are pregnant females and very easy to pet. I am always cautious of nature in their natural environment but if you follow the directions given these are beautiful gentle animals. Don't miss the opportunity to mingle with the rays!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Red Sail Sports is awesome the people were very helpful and watched all of us when in the water never felt alone and had a great breakfast to boot. Do it Soon!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,This was my 3rd visit to Stingray City. Captain Chris was patient and helpful and taught us a lot. We were a small group of 8 and it was perfect. We fed them squid and got to hold and pet them. One of my favorite things to do and can't wait to go back!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,This was one of the stops on a jet ski tour that also included Rum Point and some snorkeling along the way. The guide provided us with information about the stingrays as well as bait for feeding them. A memorable experience!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Really should not be missed. It is one of those outings that you hear so much about but it is still not to be missed. It is a unique experience that is well worth the investment.

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Swimming with stingrays was one of the coolest travel experiences of my life. The boat took us to Stingray City a sandbar in the North Sound of Grand Cayman. Standing and wading in the shallow sandbar in the middle of the warm Caribbean sea surrounded by stingrays was surreal and amazing. We loved every minute of it!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Feed the rays squid they LOVE it! Just remember to shuffle your feet and you'll do fine. Not scary at all.

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,This is amazing! The water is only about waist deep and there are sting rays everywhere ! They swim all around you and let you touch them and even pick them up if you are brave enough!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,One of our favorite things we did on our cruise. We went through Moby Dick Tours and they were great. Definitely an unforgettable experience!

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We took a Red Sail Sports catamaran to Sting Ray City and Rum Point. We were snorkeling with cameras so in addition to being able to hold the sting rays we had ample opportunity to get many pictures. There were 25-30 rays of various sizes.. It was definitely worth the time and the cost.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Marked this one off the bucket list. So much fun we ended up going twice during our visit. Stingrays are friendly and will swim right up to you for food.

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,As long as care is taken there is no danger from the stingrays. They are beautiful and graceful as they glide through the clear water.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Dexter's Fantasea Tours was awesome. The sun water and sand are the best here. The larger groups (Red Sail) are very commercialized and not real inviting. I would recommend Captain Dexter's tour.

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We went to Stingray City with White Sand Water Sports from the Reef Resort & it was wonderful the rays glide around you in the bluest ocean you've ever seen truly a magical experience!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We took the afternoon tour and it was awesome.Not crowded and our guideBert was able to spend so much time with us.He was so knowledgeable about the stingrays.All of our group said this was their favorite excursion.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,loved everything about it the feel of the stingrays was weried the guides very informative the water was beautiful and clear i recommend this trip
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Sting Ray City is very popular and is possibly the number one spot for visitors and residents alike. A truly stunning experience why not combine this as part of the many snorkel sites to make a day of it? Be warned it gets busy expect boatloads or suncreamed up passengers at peak times

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,What can I say...crystal clear water huge Rays that you can touch and feed. A wonderful way to spend half a day with family and children of all ages. You can take your own camera but the professional pictures were too good to pass up
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,This was my favorite part of the whole trip. I probably would have selected a different operator to take us out there if I had had more time to plan as I thought the group was too large and the snorkel locations on the way back kind of sucked. But Stingray City itself was amazing something I will remember forever!

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,The tour guides were very friendly and funny and they really knew theyre stuff about stingrays. They told us the rules and then we had fun. You can snorkel and swim with the rays thwy let you hold them and you kiss them(: which is an unforgettable experience.i reccomend this excursion 100%!!!

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,There is a reason this activity is ranked number one in Grand Cayman. There is nothing like it in the world. I tell everyone I know who is going to Grand Cayman whether on a cruise or staying on the island this is one activity you have to do!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,I would book trip when cruise ships are not in. We went with Capt Marvin and had a great time. Make sure when they are taking your pictures that only people you know are in the background as this distracts from the photo's. A once in a lifetime experience.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We live in Cayman and have taking all of our house guests there at least once in their visits. Not only they enjoy it but so do we - as many times as we have done it and it is "touristy". It is unique fun relaxing and a true beauty.

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,if you are ever in the cayman islands i highly recommend a trip to stingray island. it was nothing short of fantastic. you actually get to swim with the rays and depending on the tour guides feed them as well. a truly wonderful experience.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Great fun just respect the stingrays. We used Captain Marvin and they were great. Can get very busy when lots of cruise ships are in so try and go when it is quiet.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,It was a great experience. You get to feed the string rays swim with them and touch them. You just have to be careful when you touch them bc they still have their stingers. It was just a cool activity.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,I don't care who you are you will LOVE this experience. These gentle creatures are so soft and love human interaction. You will need transportation to the site via boat or jet ski but there are many outfits to choose from.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,It was so fun to hold pet kiss and feed the stingrays. The area was lined with tour boats and crowded with tourists but there were plenty of stingrays to go around! Great time!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,I go here as many times as possible when I go. I had the whole thing to myself for almost an hour . Never gets old.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Great experience to swim with touch feel and feed the sting rays. Usually such feared animals. Amazing experience
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Beautiful place to visit.. Clear blue water.. Amazing scenic views.. This was like a mini regatta experience with stingrays.. All seemed so friendly like they come there to play with the humans.. Awesome experience.. It's a must do

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Last time we did this (i forget who with) we did the stingrays including all feeding them then went to the reefs edge to go snorkelling. This trip was with red sail we didn't get to feed the stingrays or go snorkelling. We did spend a lot of time at rum point which was nice though.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We booked this excursion with Red Sail and it was amazing. We came to stingray city early before all the other boats and we did bit the crowds. It was fantastic to be able to swim and touch the rays. The Red Sail stuff was very knowledgable and showed us how to handle rays. Highly highly recommended.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,It was amazing to swim with stingrays. But the place was packed out way too many people and some of the tour guides handled the rays roughly. We felt like we were seeing some of the worst of man and nature. And some of yhe best.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Booked this excursion with our cruise ship and loved it! Once in a lifetime experience interacting with these majestic creatures. Highly recommend!

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,By far the best thing to do when in the Grand Cayman! It's about 1.5 hrs longwent on a glass bottom boat and snorkeled as well. It was absolutely amazing. I would do this over and over again!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We did!!!! Best day ever!!!!! Everybody in our group thought it was the greatest day ever!!! Enjoy!!!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Went on this trip as an excursion on a cruise. The crew was fabulous and helped all of us enjoy the whole experience to its fullest!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,we took a more personal 10 person boat that was arranged by the white sands at the reef resort. early morning first boat to arrive. makes you feel like your own lil paradise. safe fun and well worth the price.

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Beautiful brilliant blue sea hot sun loads of huge rays a great time loved it. we went independantly with sunray tours which was good also snorkelled close by which was excellent brilliant coral and amazing fish. A must do.

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We were so impressed with how comfortable and friendly the Stingrays were. Besides the bioluminescence tour this was our favorite part of the whole trip!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,It was a bit rough on the water the day we went but to hear my wife squeal when touched by the stingrays was worth the trip! Our guides did a great job explaining safety around the rays feeding them and of course pictures. We would go again.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,White Sands Boat Trip was terrific....take the small group 7am trip. Chris did a fabulous job and he comes to pick you up on the East End as part of the pkg price.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Wow! I went on a big boat and in the future will book with Ambassador Divers instead. Going in the water with the southern stingrays is really amazing. We saw some of the same stingrays that we saw two years ago. We were told they can live for a very very long time. Very cool thing to do.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Although can be crowded at times Stingray city was a unique experience interacting with wild Stingrays that would brush up against you as they cruised the sand point for handouts... Gorgeous scenery and exhilarating!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We booked a tour to Stingray City using Discount Excursions. It was amazing and very much worth the price of the tour.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We had a great visit with Stingray Sailing! This is a smaller boat than many providing personalized service to all passengers.

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Even if it is one of the most impressive touristy thing to do in the Caymans I really enjoyed watching the Stingrays and touching them. I would recommend going there with a jet ski tour from the Holiday Inn. I went twice.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,My husband and I went to Stingray city on a cruise excursion. Captain Stacey and his helpers were very helpful in the water with the rays. It was neat touching the rubbery feeling creatures and we had several pictures taken handling the them. The aqua water was very beautiful to see.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,You must go. That's all I can say. The rays are beautiful the water is waist high and crystal clear. We opted to go out on jet skis what a great decision.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We took a tour with Dexter's Fantasea to Stingray Sandbar. His trip was well organized and great for the whole family. We loved the interactions with the stingrays. Our daughter touched held fed and kissed a stingray. Would highly recommend.

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,This was my daughter and mine 2nd time and we took my sons girlfeiends my mom and my aunt. After talking stingray city up we wete so disapointed there had to be 12-15 boats all docked in a circle with 20-30 people on each. The boat owners were fighting for spots and stingrays. Very upseting!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Sting Ray City is amazing. You are in the water with wild sting rays that are so used to humans that they rub up against you like kittens! Use Captain Marvin's to go out there. They are professional efficient caring and everything you could ask for. They really want everyone on the boat to have a good time.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Nice excursion from the ship. A nice boat ride. Fun to do once. Some children may become scared when rays swim by and touch them. Guides let you hold and pet them. Beautiful clear water on the sandbar
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We went on a private boat and got there early before the cruise ships. It was amazing feeding petting and seeing the rays. We also went snorkeling by the reef close by. Great time.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Captain Chris from White Sands took us for a Sunrise visit. We were the ONLY boat there with 75-80 rays. Definitely worth getting up for.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,This was definitely a highlight of our visit. Swimming with stingrays is something you won't forget. Try to book a tour with fewer tourists.

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,This was the highlight of our cruise. Staff was wonderful and many Stingrays around. The staff talked about the Stingrays and spent the whole time letting people hold the stingrays.. Then it was off to Coral Gardens. The water is crystal clear. Great time.

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,This is one of those bucket list items. Very cool!! Stingrays were amazingly gentle but definitely knew when the squid came out for feeding time.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,The tour boats are overwhelming. Better to go on small boat and pay extra. Plus people were wasted on the tour boats and acted like idiot in the water. One guy was pulling the tail of the stingrays.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Absolutely amazing! That is all I can say! Our tour was arranged by Celebrity Cruises and we were extremely pleased with all arrangements instructions and of course our interaction with the stingrays. At no time during our visit at Stingray City we felt that this was not safe. We have memories that will last for a lifetime!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Went out on Miss LC with captain Otis and crew. Everyone was really nice and the experience was great!!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We visited Stingray City on a cruise ship tour that also included the sea turtles. The stingrays were the best part of the cruise! The photographer was amazing - we don't know how he could stay on his feet and get such good pictures. Very friendly crew (African Grey Tours) wonderful experience!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,This is definitely worth it. Use Red Sail to avoid the crowded older boats. The sail back on the catamaran was awesome!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We opted to charter a boat rather than go with the crowds well worth the money. We were somewhat removed from the tour crowds and our captain guides us through the experience. Amazing they are so docile and gentile almost like dogs looking for a snack and snuggle. I would highly reccomend this.

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,It is a beautiful place. We sail out on a boat and enjoy the stingrays. It is amazing to get in the water and pet and hold the Rays and its the saddest thing ever when we have to go back to the boat. GREAT PLACE
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,This place was great! I didn't realize you can stand in the middle of the sea in 4 feet of water and interact with such sweet creatures! Great experience we came here twice during our five-day trip. It was our favorite part of being in the Caymans.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Captain Marvin's 3-stops tour was an excellent choice for us we were in a small group and spent some unforgettable moments with those wonderful creatures - feeding holding and swimming with them.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We went with a group so it was rather crowded but the experience of jumping out of a boat in the middle of a sea and being in the middle of huge stingrays was awesome. Do it!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Certainly a neat experience if you have the time and it's free if you have a boat or some other ride.

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,This was the high light of our trip! I'm a nature lover anyhow but I enjoyed this so much. There we were standing on a sandbar feeding these giant gentle creatures! What an experience! After that our ship captain took us snorkeling another wonderful experience!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,This was our second time going to Stingray City. We prefer the Sunrise Stingray City trip with White Sand. Captain Chris was fantastic. He always makes you feel safe and doesn't rush you. I would highly recommend going early in the morning before the crowds start
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,this place is very cool. we booked through carnival cruise excursions with marineland tours..it was called the deluxe stingray city tour. our guides were so informative and it looked like we may have been one of the only groups to have fed the rays. neverthelessthis place is so fun. the rays are beautiful and the scenery is fantastic.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,get there early or deal with the crowds!!The cruise ship crowds are getting dangerously overdone. Go with a smaller outfitter...

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We have been 3 times as we own a timeshare at Morritts. We have gone with my elderly parents and even our one year old nephew. Always great and so much fun to watch the reactions on peoples faces. We always go on the catamaran with Red Sail Sports and always fun. Would highly recommend.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Highly recommend this excursion! Great family experience. Water shoes and snorkel gear weren't required during our visit. Plenty of friendly stingrays and awesome scenery.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Second trip to stingrays city. This time with newbies. We all loved it. Kissed the stingrays for 7 years good luck
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We booked online ahead of time with Moby Dick Tours and had a blast! There were approx. 35 people & so we got plenty of time with the stingrays and at the snorkel reef.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Had a blast would recommend this and would love to go again! Amazing staff friendly and very knowledgeable. Great Experience!!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Very fun morning excursion. Get dropped off at 7 mile beach on way back for fun in the sun before your cruise ship departs.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,So enjoyed interacting with the Sting Rays. Truly a unique experience. Also loved the second snorkeling stop at the Garden. It was like being in an aquarium!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,The stingrays were wonderful and you can get very close to them but the place was crowded so I'd go on an early trip. If you look in some of the tourist mags you may get a discount

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,This is a must see and do while on Grand Cayman. These beautiful rays just love us back. Take a boat ride or jet ski and make this trip a experience of a life time.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,If the sea is calm wow what an experience we loved it and have visited it several times the snorkling is also very good loads to see

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,I have been to this location a few times in years past. It is a great event that everyone should experience at some time in their life.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,I would definitely recommend a visit to Stingray City! It's amazing that these creatures congregate in this area and we are able to interact with them. They were gentle and beautiful creatures. Definitely come with a small tour group however so that you can get some more interaction time with the Rays.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Loved this excursion. We took it while on a cruise on Royal Caribbean's Brilliance of the Seas. It was a combined with swimming with the dolphins at Dolphin Cove. We spent about an hour in the water with the stingrays. Our guides were very informative and helpful. The dolphin swim was also great!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We don't usually get caught up in tourist traps but are we ever glad we did this one! An amazing experience. I highly recommend this excursion. You will not regret it.

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,An excursion from our ship. The boat had a bar and rest room so it was large enough and "friendly enought not to intimidate. The crew was excellent and the experience should not be missed.Even though it was rough that day a great experience.

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Well worth your time and money. My family and I used 6 Sense and it was wonderful. Great time for young young kids (mine are 3 & 5) or elderly persons.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Captain Claiborn and David with Kelly's were very friendly and informative. What an extraordinary place to go! We have been able to take family there when they visit us and Kelly's Tours have always taken great care of us and I always learn something new!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,This was an experience like no other. Our trip was with Captain Marvin's. The lead guide was knowledgable and enthused. The boat was comfortable. Getting in the water with dozens of stingrays and feeding them by hand was unlike anything I have ever experienced. I would recommend this to anyone with a spirit of adventure and an interest in nature.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,It was very good to be in this sandy patch in waist high water among a bunch of Stingrays. Great to do it once.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Great family excursion. The Stingrays were very friendly and we all were able to hold them. They are very silky soft... I also scuba dove with them. Lots of fun!!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Knowing that my husband would thoroughly enjoy this I booked an excursion through Fat Fish Adventures. This is a must for everyone. The stingrays are so used to people being around them and feeding them that it is an amazing adventure.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Got to hold the stingrays and it was awesome! Highly recommend this trip! Was fun to be in the water with the stingrays
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,It's one of those things you don't get to do every day so if you are here I suggest going and feeding the stingrays it was a good time.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,From the very beginning of the adventure the crew was very professional and so very knowledgeable about the stingrays. They made sure that everyone in our group got to touch hold and feed the rays. This is one excursion that my wife and I could and will repeat again

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Loved this! So much fun and its something you have to do if you go to Grand Cayman. We went out with Dexter from Dexter's Fantasea Tours.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We expected this to be nice but it was much more fun than expected. It was worth the travel over to the North Side of the island and we enjoyed the boat ride out and just loved touching the stingrays. We left from Rum Point and enjoyed a snack there.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,this has been around for years and is likely something you will only do once or twice but is definitely worth it once. EVERYONE who takes you out is well trained and versed in what to do and how to do it. There are a variety of ways to get there sail power etc. etc.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,well worth it and go at sunrise if you can! (best to avoid the party boats and ships in port crowds)
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,The stingrays are friendly and abundant. They are not shy about brushing up against you and asking for food. One literally came up out of the water and almost kissed me! I loved it however this is not for the timid a couple friends went back to the boat. They did not care for all the "touching" by the rays.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,i went three times during my visit. i will be back. life changing. what more do i need to say? i went three times during my visit. i will be back. life changing. what more do i need to say?

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Thoroughly enjoyed visiting the sandbar...the stingrays are neat creatures and now I will have 7 years of good luck after kissing mine!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We used Cayman tours to go to stingray city. They were very accommodating. Stingray city was wonderful. The place not to be missed. You can swim with stingrays and hold them.

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We had an amazing experience it was so much fun! Our guide Bert the Stingray Whisperer was so nice and fun! He made the excursion enjoyable and fun! He also had lots of fun facts about stingrays! Will do it again must do!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Nothing to add -- it might be touristy but it's incredible all the same. Must visit. If you can combine it with some nice sailing and snorkeling along the way makes for a great afternoon!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Exciting to stand on a sand bar and touch a sting ray. No danger. Go early in morning when there are fewer boats.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,What a great experience was wonderfull gorgeous sea gorgeous animals very friendly and gentle was an experience that if you go to cayman you MUST go
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,The stingrays are amazing and super friendly! I did not know they would just come up to you and want to be pet. We also fed them and they have quite a bit of suction. Very neat experience!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,A must do if you visit the Cayman Islands. The Stingrays are amazing - hard to believe how friendly they are. Had the chance to hold on of the Rays and overall a great adventure and experience.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Gives you a whole new respect for the stingrays. Captain Marvin's crew was awesome! Everyone got involved even the little ones.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,If you go to Cayman Islands and you don't go and kiss/swim w/ stingrays-you'll definitely regret it! It was one of my most memorable times here and in my life..SO MUCH FUN!

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Not a true snorkeling trip...kind of creepy to have a stingray on your back. Wouldn't recommend . Seems like just a tourist trap
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Third time to visit and had more fun watching the kids getting into holding and feeding them. It is usually crowded but still plenty of room and just be patient. Make sure you go with a guide that has food.
g147365,d2198364,March 5 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 5 2016,What else can be said that hasn't already been said? This is one of the essential trips everyone must do when visiting Grand Cayman These beautiful creatures are so wonderful okay so they get fed but it is a truly wonderful experience. Five stars..!

g147365,d2198364,March 5 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 5 2016,Take Six Senses Tour for Sting Ray City. It was a great experience and an outstanding day! No place like it anywhere else that I've ever been even in Hawaii. Nothing like it!
g147365,d2198364,March 5 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 5 2016,One of our favorite experiences during the trip. Water was a little rough would have been better with calm winds. Very cool for whole family.
g147365,d2198364,March 4 2016,This is my favorite excursion in Grand Cayman! The stingrays are absolutely gorgeous creatures and very friendly. I plan to go everything I'm there.
g147365,d2198364,March 3 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 3 2016,A must if visiting Grand Cayman. Feeding and swimming with these beautiful gentle creatures is an adventure and memory you'll cherish. If you want see them without the crowds book a sunrise tour. Worth the early alarm.

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,The stingray city tour was absolute the highlight of our Cayman trip. We are scuba divers but never had this kind of up close encounter with this beautiful creatures. Tip: go when the sea is calm. Go with Acquarius if you want to have a good time!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Good fun I have been dozens of times now and it is just as I remember. Took a nice catamaran there on the most recent trip and couldn't be happier.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,all 3 plus the wife loved it. didnt make it there on our first trip to the cayman but went this time... want to go back again. moby dick tours was excellent and they made sure all the kids werre safe and helped my little guy get comfortable in the water. must see!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Water was super rough the day we went but it was still An unforgettable experience to swim with these amazing creatures. We learned so much and got to feed hold and kiss Sandy!! So cool. My kids can't stop talking about this trip and our day with Red Sail Sports Grand Cayman.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Please take a trip out to Stingray City! It is an amazing experience! The water is lue warm and waist deep - unbelievable setting. A once in a lifetime chance to see beautiful creatures in their world. Do not miss this!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,This is a must do attraction the experience is first class. The stingrays are just wonderful you are allowed to feed them and kiss them you must do this. Also the snorkelling that is available is fantastic.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,The guidebooks and YouTube video made it look too touristy like a Shamu show but it was actually nice. Our boat went there late in the day and we were the only ones visiting. We really enjoyed communing with the relatively tame rays and got some good photos for the memory.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Unique very interactive trip We went with Captain Marvin does a great job. Can feed hold kiss stingrays. Nice boat ride out and two snorkel stops as well.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,This was a great experience - the stingrays are VERY friendly and honestly seemed to like the women a LOT! BRING A CAMERA!!!!!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,WOW~ Blown away by the beauty of this place and the sweet stingrays which dwell here. It's a must do for any visitor to the Caymans.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Don't miss it. We booked directly with Captain Marvin vs. doing it through the cruise line. Loved it... didn't dislike anything. Would live to do it again with my family.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We had a great experience at stingray city easy to see why it is the #1 attraction. Was quite rough the day we went which was a bit of a challenge but the good news was there was only one other boat. Really neat to interact with these creatures as they are very gentle.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Best day ever! Great value Booked in advance when no cruise ships Great snorkeling Stopped at 4 locations All tours seem to do great job

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,If you want an up close experience with stingrays this is for you. Be prepared to have stingrays all over you. Kids do get a bit freaked out if there little. Best to go when the water's are calm. Bring your underwater camera & eye drops the water has a very high salt content. Very fun trip!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Make sure that you BYOB if you take one of the cheaper boats. I was wanting a boat drink!!! I forget which tour we took but no alcohol was on the boat and the captain's helper said we should have brought some.

I never thought I'd see my wife in the middle of the ocean but there she was standing on a sand bar in waist deep water with a life preserver having a great time among the stingrays.

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Do not miss this. Stingrays are actually very friendly. Take the jet ski tour out of the holiday inn resort.

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Incredible to see the stingrays up close and in shallow water without need for much more than a mask and snorkel. It can be windy though so the ride out to the reef area can be a little exciting as well!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Went on the sunrise tour with Ocean Frontiers. Just us (family of 5) and the stingrays. Have been last year in the middle of day and was quite crowded. The sunrise tour was wonderful.

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Such fun! Snorkeling and experience with sting rays. Captain Marvin's competent staff was just right. Boats not overloaded; guided us well. Good humor with safety. Great photos from Allison!

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,The sheer number of people was a little overwhelming. I recommend an early morning or late afternoon tour to avoid the chaos.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,This is one of the most nice place I've been when I was in Cayman. The stingrays are amazing creatures they don't fear humans and allow us even to grab them. The water color is spectacular.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,I'm pretty stingy and hate to spend money on touristy stuff. This is worth the money if you find a good operator to take you. It was amazing and very very cool. You'll never do anything like it. And even thought the pictures might be expensive from tour people it's worth it.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We were Inge caymans off a cruise ship dec 2012. Took this tour. Omg. The stingrays were amazing! What a great experience
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,I honestly have no dislikes about this excursion! There are plenty of stingrays which means no waiting in line. Dont forget to kiss the stingrays granting you 7 years of good luck.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Incredible amazing and breathtaking barely begin to describe this adventure. Many people are somewhat cautious of rays as they look like aliens and little is heard about them. Once you get in the water however all that changes they are gentle giants that get up close making this experience extraordinary. Recommendable!!!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,While the stingrays were cool there were a lot of boyars there when we went even though we went late in the afternoon after the cruise ship folks had departed. It is a unique experience and something you should do but perhaps the 630am trip would have been better
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,This is a place you can either scuba dive Only 15 feet or snorkel but you are really standing on the bottom and the stingrays swim all around you. Some of the guides rub them on your back Very safe A must if you are visiting Grand Cayman
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Feeding kissing & swimming among the southern stingrays is really an amazing experience. After going in to the water the stingrays are all around of the people. On a guided tour is somebody to take pictures of you while kissing the ray or getting a massage of one of the rays. As well bait will be provided.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Great boat trip out to the sand bar where the stingrays  that was wonderful the only issue there was so many people you could bump into people. Overall a really great experience. Would recommend it.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,One of the best part of my trips to Grand Cayman was a private tour to Stingray City and the ability to feed pet and hold stingrays! Amazing experience!

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Really awesome experience. The rays really get close and personal with you. Was a bit nervous at first but eventually ended up holding a few stingrays and feeding them as well. The guide Leon made everyone feel comfortable in the water with the stingrays. This is a "must do" in CI.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Couldn't ask for a nicer day trip great people  fun with the rays and friends .we went with captain Marvin's the bus ride over was a little cramped but once on the boat plenty of room only about 15 to 20 a boat .we got some great pictures and had a blast .
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Captain Marvin's tour was excellent. We did Stingray City (by the way we didn't enjoy beeing with the stingrays sooooo much). Anyway the views the colours of the ocean make it worth it. We also did 2 snorkelling stops which were AMAZING. I would definitely recommend this excursion to anyone wanting to have fun and to explore this paradise.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Captain Marvin’s is the way to go. They give a great tour and are a lot more affordable than some of the other options. If you can request to go with Vernon.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Was probably one of the best things I did on island. It is amazing to hold a 150lb stingray. I enjoyed it alot. A must do if your here.

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,I know it seems a little unnatural to swim with pet feed hold and kiss stingrays- but if they didn't like the human company they'd leave the area wouldn't they? We really enjoyed our time there.

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,The stingrays were so friendly and approachable. We visited in February 2015 and had unusual high winds. I get sea sick easily but was able to get to Stingray City with no problem!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,The biggest highlight of our trip! It was so neat being able to swim with feed and pet the stingrays! We captured some amazing photo and video memories with our go pro. I would definitely recommend stopping by Stingray City and would love to go back some day!

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Favorite part of my trip to the Caribbean!! A must do! The sting rays are so smooth and soft loved feeding them!! Had the chance to kiss and hold them as well!! Snorkeling was really exciting better with a water camera!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We went out with Captain Jimmy Ebanks but I understand he has retired. This is well worth doing at least once in a lifetime. Feeding the stingrays is an extraordinary experience.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,They take you to a sandbank not far from Rum Point the color of the sea is of an amazing turquoise. light blue and you are surrounded by loads of stingrays. Awesome experience cos you can hold them caress them feed them and even kiss them!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,such beautiful graceful creatures! It was a real joy to be surrounded by them and our tour operators (cayman turtle divers) have great respect for them and gave us great instructions on approaching feeding and yes even kissing them.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,This is our 2nd time visiting the island and both times we went to Stingray City and would definitely recommend to anyone.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,A truly amazing experience swimming with hundreds of stingrays and getting the opportunity to hold them and even kiss them for 7 years good luck! The shallow water ensures it is a safe day out for families as well as groups of friends

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,To be able to stand in the middle of the Lagoon & be surrounded by these incredibly friendly Stingrays is amazing.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Most definetely worth the trip...very neat experience to hold touch and chum a stingray out in its original habitat..even the stops to snorkel on the way are full of opportunities to see abundant ocean life! The waters here are so clear.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,This is unique way to interact with stingrays. While standing in the water up to your waist they will approach you and touch you with their wings. Our guides were able to bring one of them to us and let them rest on our arms. We even got a kiss! Feeding them squid got them quite excited!

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Came only because my wife wanted to but I had a great time. The water was very clear and only about 4 feet high. The stringrays cooperated and were fun to be around.

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,I live in Grand Cayman but for visitors this is a must do. Period. Do it! Personally I have always taken my guests to Stingray City via Captain Marvin's. They are affordable friendly and do not overcrowd their boats.

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We had a wonderful time. There were several older people in out group who normally used walkers or wheel chairs to get around and they all had a great time with our guide Burt. We were able to hold the stingrays and got a lesson in their gender and how they use their stinger for safety.

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,You leave the Reef at 6:15 AM and drive to Rum Point/Kaibo dock. Your the only boat out there and it's really special. You drive out to a sandbar and get into the water with the rays pretty cool.

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Had a blast petting and holding and feeding stingray's! Didn't think I would want to do this but had a fabulous experience and would definitely do it again!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We took a charter boat out with friends - Captain Charlie's boats. We left early in the day - and got to Sting Ray City in about 30 minutes. The stingrays swim up to the boat immediately and are very tame. A highly unusual sight well worth the trip!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Experience of a lifetime - must do. Go on a Sunday or other day when there are no cruise ships in town.

Stingray city is so much fun where else can you snorkel and kiss a stingray we even had a dolphin come by the locals call him stinky.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,You cant lost the stingrays city! You can swimm with the stingrays you can kiss you can feed hug...dont forget the smiley face! Ask you guide about the smiley face photo!

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We took the sting ray tour on a day when there were no cruise ships in port. The more cruise ships the more crowed this stop. We stopped at a reef for snorkeling before sting ray city. The sting rays came up to us right away for feeding and just rubbing against us.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Stingrays were so cool. They came up to us right away and I was able to hold one for 10 minutes!!! One of the top 5 things I have ever done on a vacation.

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Would go back for sure! Crystal clear water and stingrays for days! Bring a waterproof camera. You can snorkelswim hold the stingrays and get some fantastic photos and videos.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Family excursion the best we have ever done! we booked through the reef resort which is where we stayed and we were driven over and taken out to the sand bar where we were instantly greeted by the sting rays. MUST DO!!

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,My husband and I visited "Stingray City" on Grand Cayman. What a neat experience! We were amazed how the animals swim all around and come right up to you especially if you're holding a piece of squid. So glad we had the opportunity!

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,I was definitely scared to actually get in the water with the stingrays but glad I did. They will not hurt you. Our tour guide Leon was very friendly and showed us how the stingrays eat. We got to feed them and snorkel as well. I recommend everyone to try this :)

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,The ride out was very pretty the sting rays were amazing loved everything about this excursion. Highly recommend it!!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,AWESOME!!!! Will go back forsure!!!!!! Fat Fish Adventure took 22 of us there. We had the time of our lives and have awesome pictures to prove it!!!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Went there with the Cobalt Coast Divers and spent an hour petting and interacting with the Stingrays. Cobalt Coast gave one of the best diving briefs I've had and totally described Stingrays and their behaviours prior to interacting with them. Excellent experience.

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,This truly is a beautiful island with lots to do and Stingray City should be at the top of the list. Very unique and an experience you'll talk about. The rays are very mild. The guides will show you just how to interact with them. And the snorkeling part is our favorite thing to do on the island.

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Going to Sting Ray City was the highlight of a recent trip to Grand Cayman. What a great experience it was to swim with these beautiful creatures.The weather was perfect and we had a delightful afternoon. An experience not to be missed!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,I love the Cayman Islands! My favorite part of the Caymans is stingray city. My husband and I took the jet skis offered by Marvin action sports. I agree with other trip advisor reviewers It was the way to see stingray city.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,My wife and I experienced Stingray City during our September 2013 vacation to Grand Cayman. We took the Red Sail excursion which was a very pleasurable outing. We never had such an experience but we're glad we did. A lot of fun very unique and quite enjoyable. Our crew assisted us with holding rays and taking pictures.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,This trip gave me the "guts" to go snorkeling again. I have a true shark-"JAWS" fear and after spending the half hour walking around petting and feeding these amazing creatures I felt so much more comfortable in the water. Captain Fozz and his firstmate Doug were wonderful and very knowledgable. It was a fantastic trip and well worth the fee.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,So amazing we fed and touched the rays. Saw cool fish and conch too! Highly recommended. Our captain Allen from his boat Double Trouble and his wife vanna were wonderful.

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Why not go? You get to be in the water with Stingrays who come visit on their own accord in the wild not a park where they're contained. They come and go as they please. It's safe and something you'll never forget. Go!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,This is our second visit to Stingray City with Captain Clinton's Sea Star Charters. We couldn't have asked for a better guide to take us out to feed and swim with the Stingrays then he made a second stop so we could snorkel in the Coral Gardens. Wonderful day out on the water...Thank you Captain Clinton!

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Swimming with and feeding the stingrays was an amazing experience. I was totally in awe the entire time. This is definitely something to experience in a lifetime.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,You will love the Stingrays - they are very friendly and used to people around them. Suggest Red Sails for the dinner cruise and Stingray City - you don't need a dive mask or fins. So easy to get close and personal with the rays. The guides gave us some octopus to feed to them and the rays loved it.

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Best to go on the earlier trip (7am) when there are less crowds. It's an amazing experience not to be missed

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,If you go to GC you have to swim with the stingrays. Get ride of all your fears. They are like puppies.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Great place to visit and see these awesome animals. Kids and all ages love it! Pick a charter that is smallish to get more personalized experience.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,I traveled alone and this was such an amazing experience to do alone or with a group. The Island Queen boat was wonderful. The Captain and staff were top-notch! Will definitely do this again!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We went to Stingray Sandbar with the famous Captain Jimmy out of Rum Point... it was quite an experience! He was great with everyone on board. If you were nervous about getting in the water he was right there with you. The stingrays are amazing to be around... very docile and so neat!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Have been dozens of times and think it is an awesome outing for families couples whatever. If you like animals and marine life in particular you will love this very special place.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,I went to stingray city with six senses eco tour and I have to admit.. It was fantastic! We were the only people there until around when we were leaving.. We had all the stingrays attention to ourselves and captain Paul told us all about them!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,This is an experience worth having. These stingray's are accustomed to being around humans and do not pose the threat that most people associate with stingrays. The guides will catch one for you and place it in your arms for your close-up encounter. It is an experience you will not quickly forget.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,I did not think I would enjoy it as much as I did. I'm so glad we did this. Because my camera settings were off the next time I'm in Grand Cayman I will do it again.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Went with Cayman Tours they had superb service. Stingray City was awesome! Got a back massage from a stingray- much cheaper than paying for a massage on the island.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Jet ski out to Stingray City is a must do! Two of us and a guide what an experience. And we got to hold a large stingray! What a trip!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,This review comes to you from someone that's afraid of chihuahuas. I was freaking out most of the time there but I faced my fears and had one of the best experiences of my life.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Unbelievable experience!! Its a must if you visit Cayman islands. Water is pure on your way to the city you get to see other amazing spots it is so relaxing..and when you get there water is up to your neck so you can really relax and enjoy stingrays
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,A wonderful trip to interact with stingrays. The quides were EXCEPTIONAL and the trip out to the reef was enjoyable. A GREAT Experience.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,This is not real diving and is pretty artificial but you have to do it once and get pictures petting stingrays. They are pretty interesting to feel and do seem to enjoy the interaction. We were very lucky to also get to dive the reef by Stingray City and really enjoyed that more!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Our visit to Stingray City (really just an area out in the ocean with a sandbar). It was a lot of fun and an experience like no other. We used Captain Marvin's tour company and they were great!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Loved swimming in the ocean with the stingrays and then going snorkelling afterwards. The only thing we did not like was the boat. Although we were a small crowd the boat was very difficult to climb back into.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Went with Desoto Cruises. They are the best in Grand Cayman. Very nice staff and informative. Had a blast with the stingrays and the staff took pictures of us swimming with them. Great value for your money
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,its just that amazing that you have to come by in visit. These stingrays are like puppies and just love the interaction.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We decided last minute to do excursion on our cruise - not with the cruise!! Unbelievable experience. Stingrays were all over the water and the water was crystal clear and it was less than 5ft deep out in the middle of the sea.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Went with captain marvins and was a experience of a life time will be back again. Got to mess with some huge stingrays and feed them
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Loved It ! Amazing Time! conquered my fear!! beautiful waters and nice people! Good Beer !Great Brugers at Margaritaville!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,My husband and I did this about 20 years ago and loved it. This time we took our children ages 11 and 8. They loved it! The stingrays are so large so a little unnerving at first. But we all really enjoyed ourselves.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Standing on the sand bar with these beautiful - very large! - animals is amazing. They brush your legs which is an extraordinary feeling. Do take squid to feed them don't look down - seeing them they look really frightening!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Do you want to kiss a wild stingray? Don't be afraid - this trip is totally worth it from start to finish!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Awesome experience for whole family with great guide from Fat Fish Adventures. Whole family got into water and interacted with these beautiful creatures.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,It is really nice to visit the place and encounter these great animals. But at the same time I have mixed feelings when you see the loads of boats and jet ski's bringing so many people and buckets of squid... Not the most eco / natural way of interacting with animals. But still an impressive experience.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,This was a small group tour booked through White Sands at The Reef Resort. We had to go very early (boat left at 7:00 a.m.) but we were the first ones to the sandbar so got up close and personal with the rays!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Dexter was awesome super chill and knowledgable. Great guy and his assistant/hand was just as awesome. Ask to meet "Goldie".
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Get up close and personal with these bizarre looking but gentle sea creatures! A really special experience; the stingrays came right up to our guides like puppies (big kinda slimy portobello mushroom-squishy puppies!) waiting to get pet. If you want to get really interactive you can "hug" one! Put this near the tip of your itinerary when visiting Grand Cayman.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Our 6th time going to Stingray City. Swim feed and handle the stingrays without fear or worry. What an experience!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,It was just incredible the stringerays just come right up to you and feeding them is a trip. Take the family.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,This was a great thing to do on our vacation. The staff was very friendly they knew what they were talking about and were also willing to take pictures of you with your own camera.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,I'm going to make this short and sweet. If you love Stingrays and don't mind them touching you GO! It was the highlight of the trip and I can't wait to go back. They are like sweet little kittens with stingers. ;)
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,If you can do it when the cruise ships are not there you have a better experience. The Stingrays are so neat to touch and play with.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,I have visited stingray city several times and it never gets old. Where else can you swim and touch 4' wide stingrays??
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,The whole experience was really fun! I loved the snorkeling and the stingrays are super used to humans so they are really gentle and friendly. Its easy to feed touch and hold them. 10/10 would recommend!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,This was a stingray experience like no other. We had been several places in the Caribbean and Hawaii and this was by far the best stingray experience we have encountered.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Stingray City is so beautiful & natural. I love the way it is in the middle of the ocean and not overrun with sales stores rules etc.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. Take advantage and go. It is slightly scary at first but trust me you are not the only one out there screaming! Beautiful clear waters and amazing animals. A MUST Do when in Grand Cayman.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,This is a must do while in Cayman. The water is so clear and the sandbar is great. The stingrays just come right up to you and are very friendly. We were able to hold them and give them a kiss for luck.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We took the trip to Stingray City with Captain Morgan. They were very courteous and professional in the trip and took the time to make the Stingray experience awesome. No need to ponder just do it.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Love love love swimming with the stingrays and feeding them. I feel like my visit came up short if I don't visit once a year. Don't miss it. Sandbar lets you stand comfortably and enjoy the experience and I am only 5' tall.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We have been here many times and are stilled awed by the stingrays! A must see! You can take a trip with the big boats but we prefer to go on a jet ski tour that has a much smaller group usually 10 at the most.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,This is an absolute must. There is no reason to be scared of the rays they are very docile. Little children were in the water with them. I suggest taking a waterproof camera for great pictures.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Stingray city in The Cayman Islands it's an amazing place. Only place to swim with friendly stingrays.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,I cant wait to go back and pet the rays we have gone 3 x now and its always great. The rays are very friendly and soft great for kids and an incredible experience for adults . The first time before kids my husband was scared and stayed on the boat but even he has come around and enjoys!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Simply amazing. Essentially domesticated stingrays who swim up to your boat and let you pet them! (Certainly not the most eco-ideal but what an amazing experience). Highlight of our visit to Grand Cayman Island without a doubt!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,A must try for everyone. Super easy. Great fun for all ages. The best tour on the island. Acquarious tours was great
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,guides can only carry 1/2 pound of squid as bait. use it well and get pictures while you still have some.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,When you go to Grand Cayman and want to go to Stingray City Book with Red Sail Sports you will be glad you did We have sailed with them 7 different times 5 to Stingray City one Sunset Sail and one Dinner Sail all were great
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,This is something you should do while in Grand Cayman. The stingrays were really calm and it was a cool experience. I was a little hesitant at first but it was a lot of fun.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Must see the stingrays. We all loved this. Even the ones who were hesitant at first ended up holding and feeding the stingrays.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,As a Dad of teenage girls I loved watching them Freak out!! LOL What a great experience Would recommend booking this trip on Cayman Luxury Charters rather than one of the large tour operators
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Took our 21 & 16 year olds plus our 13 month old and all LOVED playing with the rays- amazing how friendly they are! Highly recommend this trip!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We did Stringray city with Captain Marvin's tour and it really is a must do! It was such a great experience having the rays just swim right up to you. I'm not going to lie it was a little intimidated at first but really was a good time. Would def do again!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,There are hundreds of stingrays in the area that you can touch hold and feed. It is really a once in a lifetime experience but I was a little scared of them being so close to me.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We went on a three stop trip with Ambassador Divers as well as Action Watersports on jet skis! It was awesome enough for two visits!! The stingrays are friendly and both guides were great!! Definitely a memorable experience! Take your waterproof camera!!!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Feeding stingrays in their environment is a unique experience. The number of stingrays can seem overwhelming but they are just friendly creatures that want to swim by for some food. Fun time!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Well worth it incredible experience. Our boat had the husband of the Dean of the Veterinary School who normally photographs visitors and he was an amazing person who took the time to explain and ensured our comfort. You will love it!!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Try and get the first boat out to Stingray City as the experience is ruined when this site is busy with too many boats too many people all jostling for the best spot too much noise. It is a really magic experience under the right circumstances but the mood can easily be lost.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,I lived in Grand Cayman and taking guests to this attraction is a must. Captain Marvins is the best! They explain everything jump in and help you take the leap to get in the water with the stingrays. Family friendly ;-)
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We have made several visits to GC and wouldn't dream of coming without a visit to the stingrays. Always great.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We loved this company! The group was small and the crew was excellent. Very interactive crew with knowledge about the reefs when snorkeling and about the stingrays. We highly recommend this crew for stingray city because they are very personable.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We chartered a yacht that took us to stingray city. Quite possibly the best stop we had. It's an amazing site to see all the tame stingrays and touch them. It's a MUST on your trip to Grand Cayman.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Perfect for any age! This cannot be missed while on Grand Cayman. You get to personally interact with stingrays in their natural habitat. The water is crystal clear and very beautiful.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Unbelievable experience do it as many times as possible. It's swimming with massive sting rays. If possible rent some jet skis to head out there makes it that much more fun.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Our family took the Sunrise Stingray tour. It was sensational. We had a wonderful time swimming with the stingrays and had the sandbar all to ourselves. Our guide Chris was the best! I highly recommend this trip
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,make sure to do stingray excursion and postmark cards from Hell.only other excursion was swimming with dolfins in another stop on cruise. this was really a 4 out of 5
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Don't be afraid to do this excursion. I guarantee you will love it! Make sure to take a water proof camera!

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Took the glass bottom boat from Rum Point to Sting Ray Sand Bar. It was not crowded and the trip was short. The water was only waist deep.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,who would of thought you could stand in the middle of the ocean swimming with stingrays! such a crazy and amazing experience the stings rays are so tame too so dont be scared
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,This is a must do activity for everybody! There are no words to do justice to the experience of being in the water with wild yet gentle sting rays. We went with a small group so there were only 6 of us and about 30 rays. It is something I will never forget
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Oh Boy Charter took our friends and families out for an unforgettable day. Diving for conchs and delicious conch ceviche out to Rum Point for lunch (and yummy Mudslides) and string ray city. It was the best.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Great opportunity to interact with stingrays! you can acutally feed this large animals in a safe environment.... so cool
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Well worth the price! This was one of our favorite things we did. I would highly recommend using Tour Cayman.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Book with Fat Fish Adventures to arrive by jet ski or boat. Don't forget your underwater camera. Incredible!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Our group took Soto Tours out to StingRay city. The boat tour was fantastic and the stingray sand bar is fantastic! Water is calm and about 3-4 feet deep where the boats all dock. Lots of fun even with kids!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We went with friends on their boat to Stingray City and brought lion fish to feed them. This is the coolest thing I have ever done! These creatures are massive and SO gentle. It was an amazing experience.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,What an amazing visit to a sandbar to swim and feed squid to friendly Stingray! Our deep sea fishing guides took us there as an added bit of excitement during our successful fishing trip. I highly recommend getting to Stingray City via any means you can!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,went with red sail tours out of rums point. captain Warren and Bill were wonderful and made certain everyone had a informative spectacular time
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,There are actually two Stingray Cities the shallow one that has literally 50+ Stingrays and the deeper one (depth 10') that is more like 10-15. They are both fun just different. The shallow one is bigger and more crowded where the deeper one is a place you will have to yourself. The Stingrays are equally friendly in both.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We took off with Captain Clinton as our guide his service and hospitality was awesome. We got to the sand bar to find Frisbee the stingray. What a trip. Highly highly recommend for anyone coming down
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,we booked with native Captain Clinton Ebanks and Simon whereas other tour boats here seemed to drop their clients in the water and let them fare for themselves amongst the sting rays- our captains were in the water with us helping up feed hold AND get massages from the sting rays! lots of fun
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,What an excellent experience. The stingrays literally act like puppy dogs. They will come right up to you but don't be scared they are very use to people. if you get the chance hold one and feed it. You will be so glad you did!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We went to Stingray City by jet ski via Action Water Sports from the Grand Caymanian Resort. Great time with the stingrays and a bonus trip to Rum Point and Starfish Point!

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Dont miss this experience!!! Its an amazing encounter with the rays!!! Fantastic!!!! Close encounter with the rays in shallow water on sandbar off of the coast. ...safe and exhilarating!!!! Highly recommend Fat Fish Adventures waverunner tour!!!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,This is something that should be on everyone's bucket list. It was wonderful. Stingrays are very gentle creatures. Their skin feels like velvet. If we ever get to The Cayman Islands again this will be the first thing I do.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,A great experience you should do once in your life. They are docile 'cute' and cuddly. Go with a good crew and be amazed while standing waist deep in the gorgeous blue caribbean sea.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,This is a great chance to see stingrays in the wild and to get up close. The stingrays are not kept in an aquarium they are wild and swim freely around looking for food you get the chance to interact and see how graceful they truly are.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Stingrays are like cats they are so friendly as they are fed by all the boats. They come right up to you. It is scary at first. Then you get right into it. 2 hour catamaran ride to the middle of the ocean to stand waist deep on a sandbar. Amazing. Once in a lifetime
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Everything was great about this adventure I highly recommend this you wont regret it I promise.. my wife and I loved it stingrays are friendly as well and the water is amazing crystal clear
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We had a large group and chartered a boat with Redsail. They picked us up close to our Rum Point villa. Perfect day!!!! Our boat our guides and the entire experience was perfect! We had divers and snorkels ages 2-60 years old! They did a great job of pleasing the entire group! Sting Rays for everyone to touch or hold.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,What a great experience!! Hop on a sailboat they take you out to the ocean with some shallow areas and swim with stingrays! What a memorable experience. Would highly recommend it and well worth the money!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Awesome experience with awesome animals. A must see at the islands. It is a little scary at first getting into the water with them but they are very friendly. Very majestic animals.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Go on a day when no cruise ships are in town - it will still be busy but not a zoo. It was a highlight of our trip and well worth it. Even the skeptics will be impressed with the experience.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Make sure to take some bread crumbs with you to feed them or some of the tours will bring squid too.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Had a great trip to Stingray City with Captain Clifton. Would recommend his boat and this trip for everyone. Superior service and equipment.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Absolutely wonderful experience. We chose to book our excursion through Captain Marvins. Not one complaint at all. They were very customer oriented and made sure that we had a great experience. Froggy Glenn and Mike were the best!!!!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,This was a great interaction with the nature. Loved the ability to feed the Stingray's and enjoy without a large crowd.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Wonderful time. Favorite e excursion ever!! We are going back this November and doing it again. Great memories!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,I highly recommend this! We took our two daughters (9 and 10) and they had the best time. Chester (our guide) was super knowledgeable and patient with our daughters. We was so gentle with the sting rays and was able to answer all of our questions. This was the coolest experience and well worth the money.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We had a great time enjoying the sunny day swimming with the Stingrays. This is a must do if ever you're in Grand Cayman.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We went with the delightful Capt. Chris for a morning tour. Small group with the area to ourselves. We were immediately surrounded by these amazing creatures. Chris knows them well and we pet fed--even danced--with them. Thrilling fun and memorable experience. Not to be missed!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Absolutely love every minute of this seim with the stingrays! Red sail tours was very friendly and helpful! The stingrays were out of this world! Shout out to my darlings sandy and sophie!!! BTW sandy is pregnant! So gentle and living! A must visit wehn u go to the Caymans!!!!!!!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We did a trip out to sting ray city in a combo package with red sail sports. However you get there just go! It's great and you get plenty of time.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Great experience but prices between charters vary greatly. I would recommend going with the cheapest one you can find because all the boats end up on the same small sand bar.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,The family loved the experience. I was a little freaked out because the stingrays are truly like little puppy dogs wanting food. We have hit stingray twice on this visit. I would recommend thawing the tour with Fat Fish Adventures.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,What a unique experience swimming with and feeding stingrays! Put this on your to-do list when on Grand Cayman.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,It was an amazing experience! The stingrays were enormous but friendly. I am so glad I took advantage of the opportunity to swim and play with the stingrays! I highly recommend this!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Had a great trip with Soto cruises to Stingray City. I am not usually game for such an adventure as I am a big ole scaredy-cat most times. It was a great experience and the stingrays were beautiful gentle and abundant. It was a one-of-a-kind experience that shouldn't be missed.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Well run and fun dive but only saw one Sting Ray. I understand nature is unpredictable so not knocking the operators just really expected a lot more Sting Rays....I think they were all full as this was the last trip of the day.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We went with Ambassador Divers to Sting Ray City. Great trip. Go in the afternoon to avoid the cruise ship crowds. It's safe it's fun. The kids were a bit leery at first but by the end they held the rays and kissed them.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,absolutely fun! you can take pictures with the stingrays and feed them. Went there via Captain Marvins. Also included 2 snorkeling stops. Nice crew.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,I thought they would be swarming around our feet so I was glad that they weren't. They were very docile and seemed to enjoy the interaction.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We booked this experience through our cruise which used The Caymanian Land and Sea Cooperative Society. We had a wonderful time and this is something I am so glad we did! Our guides were very nice made sure everyone had a photo opportunity with the stingrays and made you feel safe. Definitely recommend!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,This was one of the most amazing things I've ever done. I was a bit fearful but quickly learned that these beautiful creatures are like puppy dogs in the ocean. They really just want you to feed them so they rub up against your legs. Kind of like a hug.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,The most amazing relaxing exciting thing we did on our vacation! We recommend it for everyone! Even the boat ride was great!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Marine land tours...Burt was amazing! Would definitely go again! Worth every penny! We even got to kiss one!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,So much fun and so cool. I was scared to touch the rays or even let them swim along my feet and legs but eventually warmed up to them and didn't want to leave. They are very unique creatures and I will definitely be back someday soon!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,You have to do this touristy event. It was well worth swimming with these creatures. Little scary at first but the stingrays want to play with you..
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,I rated the value as excellent because my friend took us out there on his boat. But from what i was looking into in pamphlets and such it is still a great value for an unforgettable experience. My wife was a little hesitant at first but she was glad she did it. Amazing animals.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Go on the first visit at 7am no one else will be there! What a feeling to be standing in the middle of the ocean in water that is waist high and warm
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Sting Ray City we have done numerous times over the years. For new visitors they will enjoy wading in and swimming with the rays. For those who have been there and done it before it's a friendly boat trip and beautiful water and a place to enjoy. It's worth a trip for young and old.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,If you're in Cayman you have to take this tour. Good for all ages kids to experienced divers. Swim with big friendly sting rays.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,So much fun-we loved it! Very interactive and peaceful snorkeling with these creatures! The sand bar was beautiful and very comfortable without water shoes. We will be back!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Really fun to travel out to SC by waverunner our guide had lots of squid to feed the rays very cool experience even though I am a diver and thought it might be corny
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,If you are on cayman.... You MUST GO ... Is so nice to interact with all the sting rays.... But is good to go on the weekends ... Cause is less people and you can play with more sting rays....
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,breakfast with the rays was amazing. Beat the crowd by being a early riser. Excursion includes breakfast pastries pictures opportunities swimming the with the sting rays and snorkeling. It was so much! Staff was very friendly and helpful with getting close to the rays for pictures or even a little smooch if you wanted.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,this is an experience of a lifetime. It is so beautiful snorkeling around the coral reefs and playing with the stingray. This is a must see for anyone visiting the Caymans.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,amazing encounters with stingrays that you really can't experience anywhere else. This was the only tourist attraction we visited and it was worth it. Take a sailboat out with Sunray tours to make this special.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We fed and swam with the sting rays. Also went snorkeling. Very reasonable for $45.00 each. Some tours charge $85.00
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We recently had a great experience of swimming with the stingrays at Stingray City. We have done this before in Tahiti but this was even better. Not a huge crowd here so more one on one with the stingrays. They were HUGE and very friendly. ENJOY! JoAnne & Bill : )
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,A bit of lazing in the sun as we cruised out to meet the stingrays then a quick lesson on how to shuffle for the low lying critters and a reminder to tuck in that thumb before feeding and this was a fun day out.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We did a breakfast on a catamaran out to Stingray City - it was terrific. First ones out there and it could not have been a more amazing experience. Who knew you could hold a stingray!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,First time for my new wife who was somewhat concerned about going. Lots of fun and everyone enjoyed it. Something the entire family can enjoy.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Dexter and Fantasea Tours were recommended to us and we pass the recommendation along. Their groups are small and true to their brochure you are not rushed. Simon is very helpful and patient with taking pictures of you and the stingrays. The snorkeling at the reef is also leisurely.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Well worth it's hype. It is an interactive experience like no other. Interacting with wildlife in their natural habitat as can only be done here.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We went on Dexter's boat. He and Simon were great. Very professional and kind. I enjoyed the snorkeling spot that Dexter stopped at probably even more than the sting rays. It had amazing coral and amazing fish. Probably the best snorkeling I've ever seen.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,this is a must see while on your stay in Grand Cayman. you get to swim with giant sting rays and touch them and even feed them. a great experience to get a chance to be up close and personal with these beautiful creatures.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Its simply a "Must Do". Hope on a charter sailboat for about $60 and spend half a day relaxing and swimming with some friendly Rays. The crew will assist you in getting that great photo.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Went with Dexter's Fantasea Tours much smaller but very well run tour. 15 total on our catamaran - Dexter and Simon were very familiar and knowledgeable about the Stingrays - we also snorkeled after our visit - would recommend for families and couples alike
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Don't miss the opportunity to see and touch these beautiful gentle sea creatures. It's not for the faint-hearted or really little children but a great experience.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We had previously swam with stingrays in Moorea French Polynesia so I wasn't super excited. However we booked Stingray City with Captain Marvin's. However once we got there I loved it. The water is clear stingrays are friendly great time!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We took trip from the White Sand Sports. We were the ONLY group on the sandbar. The encounters with stingrays were unforgettable and "a must" if you visiting Grand Cayman preferably with White Sand Sports. We loved it!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,very interesting opportunity to interact with Rays in their own environment. Very professional introduction by Red Sail Sports.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Exceptional experience. Capt. Marvin's boats and crews treat you right. Go when cruise ships are not in port as it is less crowded and you can interact with the sting rays best this way. They are gentle smooth to touch and yes do kiss one!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,The guides were awesome! Very professional! We did this excursion last year when we cruised with Carnival (I'm just a little late getting the review on Trip Advisor). But it was a great experience!!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We did the reef snorkel/stingray city catamaran trip. It was one of the most fun things we did while GC. The Red Sail tours have a cash bar and a big spacious boat so that is why we chose them. While nervous at first it was amazing to actually hold the stingrays and the ocean/scenery is BEAUTIFUL from out there.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Captain Chris took us out on a inner coastal fishing trip then over to stingray city. It was beautiful to see the rays swimming freely in the ocean. And to be a part of it was amazing they glided thru the water with grace. You can pet them give them bits of squid. It's a nice way to see them.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Price was great included lots of food to feed the rays snorkel stop afterwards was to very colorful area. Even included stop at Starfish point. One of the best things (and most affordable) we did while there.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Went to Stingray City" on glassbottomboat with Red Sails sports had a blast Warren and Fuss made sure we all had a chance to feed and inneract with rays GREAT TRIP!!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,After getting past the Steve Irwin fear ( :\ ) we had an awe-inspiring time learning how to interact with the stingrays. They seemed like the Golden Retrievers of the ocean: "Hi. Pet me. Love me. Feed me. Pet me some more. Hi." Unbelievable that they are that docile out in the wild.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Great place to visit and a must do in grand cayman. Legend has it that the stingrays started coming when the fisherman would come into the shallows gut fish and grow he insides overboard. Totally safe
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We went on a private sailboat. This made the experience so much better. Not 100 ppl on a boat just 6 plus the capt and his wife. We went to where it is about 10-12 feet of water and swam with the stingrays. They are very soft.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Great experience but just be warned that it can be crowded when the cruise ships are docked in Georgetown. Find a charter that does not try to cram 25 people on a boat for 10. Afternoon trips seem to be less crowded with fewer boats. Very friendly rays but I have seen grown men not leave the boat...just kidding.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Wonderful adventure very friendly stingrays are fascinating to watch move through the water and get up close and personal. Highly recommended.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,The Stingray tour with Moby Dick Tours is the BEST! A MUST DO for visitors to Grand Cayman! My friends and I had a wonderful time and the weather and ocean was beautiful!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,It is not every day you get to feed a stingray. We booked it from The Reef resort and took a small boat out. Early morning or weekends are the best time to go.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Use Captain Dexter - he and his crew were great! We had a nice trip out to see the stingrays fed them held them a great time!

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We picked a day the cruise ships weren't in and were definitely glad we did. There were only 2 other boats out which gave us plenty of space to interact with the stingrays. What fun!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,If you're not afraid from it you will enjoy your time over there great moments we went on a cruise had to visit it then went for a restaurant to have seafood amazing area
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,You take a boat from one side of the island for about an hour to a sand bar. I went with the breakfast trip with red sail sports. Worth more to me to be able to get first chance to swim with and hug a ray.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,you can purchase this tour right at the port for cheaper then the cruise ship we had a good time both times we did it

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,It is considered bad luck if you do not kiss a stingray while you are here. Make sure to tuck your thumb away when feeding them...they do have teeth. Unfathomable experience.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,You don't get kisses from a stingray everyday and that's just one reason why stingray city is amazing. To inner act with these creatures is just amazing. They're so beautiful and gentle. My heart just melted.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,This is a must attraction it provides the excitement of being to hold a stingray in natural habitat and all the fears of large sea animals. Once you calm down the stingrays are just large soft animals like big teddy bears. It is well worth it.

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We went their before it was covered by National Geographic Magazine. A small boat with a few people. Charming trip. But its become Cruise-ship Disney meets Godzilla . Crowded and the Stingrays are kissed and held for photos . Seems a bit abusive. i guess we were spoiled by the first visit

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,If you are on the island this is a must do attraction!!! The boat ride was amazing and then of course the sting rays too!!! We were with our two boys and they both LOVED it! Rum Point is a cool place to spend the day as well. A great lunch by a beautiful beach!!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Loved the personal touch of White Sands Co! Professional and personal. Much better than large groups!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We just returned from our 7 day cruise and are still talking about the great experience we had with stingray sailing! Swimming with the stingrays was the highlight of our trip! I would totally recommend stingray sailing to anyone going to Grand Caymans! We want to go back! Chip and his crew do an incredible job!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Anyone who goes on any of the available tours will have an incredible day. These animals love the human interaction seeking food and interact with everyone in your group. There are not many wild animal excursions in the Caribbean like this. Take it in any enjoy.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,This was the highlight of our trip. I have never seen a stingray in person. Not only do you see lots of stingrays you also get to touch or hold them. There are a number of ways to go. We used The Reef superb staff to help us with the right combination for us.

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Any visitor to the island must go to the Stingray City. It is one of a kind in the world. All the tours end up at the same place so I'm in difference of which tour company. You are only on the boat for 35+ minutes. Take waterproof camera and take lots of pictures.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We loved the proximity of the sandbar to Rum point. It was a bit choppy the day we were there yet very bearable due to the protection of the outer rocks. The stingrays were amazing and almost pets. Obviously they know there is a constant food supply yet it doesnt seem like a rigged attraction either.

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Pay the extra money and dive instead of snorkel. It's a night and day experience. This is one of the cooler things we have done. I would put this on par with swimming with dolphins. This is also something we would gladly do each time we visit Grand Cayman.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,The ride out to Stingray City was beautiful. I enjoyed swimming with the stingrays once I got past the fear factor. Really great time - an activity that shouldn't be missed in the Caymans.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Stepping int crystal clear water teaming with large stingrays was amazing! What fascinating creatures. Seemed that all they wanted was for you to rub their bellies as they nuzzled into your body You must take the time to do this!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Very unique experience. The rays are unbelievably tame. Very cool. Book with a smaller operator like stingraysailing might cost you a little more but you will avoid the big cattle boats. I can't imagine doing this on one ofvthose boats.Some of them had 25+people. We had twelve on our boat...
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Everyone must go there at least once! It is an amazing place where stingrays have trained human beings to feed them daily! They are tame and if handled correctly they feed off your hands and don't mind being held.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,It is worth seeing at least one time but I've gone twice. There were about 30 or so stingrays ranging in size. The water is crystal clear and waist deep. There is nothing to be nervous about they are very friendly. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We booked a tour of Stingray City Sandbar in Grand Cayman on our last Disney cruise and it was an awesome time. The crew aboard the Marineland Tours boat was great and we had an enjoyable ride out and back. We recommend this excursion.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Great trip to stingray city - we always go when we are in Cayman it is such a great experience. This trip we went with Sun Rays Tours Stingray City Great Experience-Great Crew

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We took a catamaran out to visit the stingrays. The water was warm and inviting and it was a great experience to touch and cuddle with the stingrays. A fun day but be sure to wear your sunblock!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,A very pleasant and easy experience. We were picked up at the hotel driven to the dock boarded the boat for a nice ride out about a mile to the shallow waters where the stingrays frequent. We were able to hold them feed them watch them. Very exciting.

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We used a local tour group at the Georgetown port. $40 for Swim with the stingrays and snorkel a reef. Guide and captain were very professional. The experience was just amazing! Just the view alone  5 miles out on the sand bars is surreal.

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Great trip and staff was wonderful. Up close with the stingrays and snorkeling in the reef-you couldn't ask for a better experience. Nice that you are pickec up at the hotel and didn't have to drive.

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,It was incredible to spend time in the water with all these stingrays! They would brush against us and swim all around us. It was a beautiful way to spend a morning.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,You have to experience this while in Grand Cayman! The stingrays were swimming all around us and we fed them squid. They were harmless and such neat creatures to see up close.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,The masses of people in water up to our shoulders manhandling these sea creatures felt wrong to me. Too much humanity and too much creepiness!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,I've both dove / scuba and snorkeled sting ray city both were enjoyable and fun. I snorkeled sting ray city with a novice lady and she had a great time. It's a little oversold and 'uses' the rays but it's a fun time and I think must do / see attraction.

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Great experience the sting rays come right up to you and let you pet and feed them. Make sure you go early or late when there are few other boats out there.

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We were up close and personal with the stingrays. I had never done this before and this was great. It was shallow enough to walk around with playing with the stingrays. They were very friendly and eager to interact with people. The guides were feeding them and the stingrays were everywhere.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We had an amazing trip to Stingray City with Captain Marvin's. The crew was great telling us about the history of the island and about the stingrays and other sea life we saw on our 3 stop trip. Our guide even held a morray eel for us all to see while snorkeling the reef!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,I wanted to swim with the stingrays on my 50th birthday. You don't swim with them as much as you just float around with them. Or they swim around you (or through your legs). It's still fun though. I would do it again.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Captain Dexter from Fantasy Sea Tours not only made it possible for us to see something amazing but also unforgettable. The sting rays are gentle giants and will take your breath away by how majestic they are.

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,This was a very cool experience! So many stingrays!!! The crew of our boat was also very friendly and engaging. Great time!!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Fun for the whole family Very cool trip well worth going. It is kinda freaky to have stingray swimming around you but they are tame and sooo many boats do this daily. The stingray are tame and used to people. This is an activity not to be missed.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,First of all I hate swimming when I know there are creatures below so I was slightly freaked out by the stingrays that cruised by and brushed my ankles. That aside standing in the middle of the Carribean sea on a sandbar was so beautiful and the stingrays so gentle it was a not to be missed excursion.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Stingrays all over the place and they are giant. Scared the heck out of the kids but very exciting. Shark skin on top and smooth as silk underneath. At one point I had about 10 of them surrounding me. They were about 3-4 feet in diameter and 5 feet long. They get too much squid from the tourists!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,This was the best excursion by far. Kissing the pregnant stingray Goldie was very cute and fun. Learned a lot of interesting facts about fish; very interesting. If you have one excursion to go on do this one!!!

Our group was 17 on a catamaran but bigger cruise tours were also there. So many stingrays that it didn't matter.Used stingraysailing.com- excellent

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We hesitated to go where there would no doubt be a lot of tourists like us but we got so interested by the surrounding stingrays and the clarity of the water that it turned out to be an extremely pleasant adventure.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We were on a cruise and booked an excursion.... we went early as could go (8am) ... and there were 50 tours out at the same time.... it was nice but too crowded and if you do go out with the cruise go early... others who came at 10 said the stingrays were all fed and not really around

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,They are simply the best and make it feel much more authentic! This is the only way to really experience Stingray City! The crew really makes you feel you are one with nature! Loved it!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,A must do on Grand Cayman!! Go with Dexter's Fantasea Tours for a more personalized experience! Dexter and Simon were great hosts!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Take a tour out to sting ray city hold a sting ray and kiss it for good luck. Out in the bay. Lots of people on tour boat days. Do a snorkel plus sting ray
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Stingray Bert is the greatest. They gave plenty of information on the excursion and the stingrays safety and all. The entire event was beautiful and pleasant all of the staff were polite fun and gracious. As a customer service trainer I give an A+ for their service. When you have the opportunity to enjoy this tour TAKE IT AND ENJOY!!!!!!!!!!

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Amazing creatures and well-worth the up close look! You actually can touch and feed the animals. Some younger kids were afraid to get in the water but they had a great view even from the boat.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,there are two places to see the stingrays. Stingray city is 12 feet deep. Stingray sandbar is 4 feet deep. Depends on whether you want to swim with them or stand amongst them and touch them even hold them. Either is a must see.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,My wife and I took a snorkel tour that included a stop at Stingray City. If you are anywhere near here you must stop. The stingrays were great to watch and feel. I hope my pictures turn out. I will never forget the experience. All nature and hopefully people don't ruin it for future generations.

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Loved the fact that it was a small group and we took this tour at 7am in the morning! Hours before the cruise ships got there! We got to feed them and it was a really special morning!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,small boat not over crowded and knowledgeable crew that also entertained us. My last experience was awful that I almost didn't go this time. There 2 site stop gave us snorkle time at the beautiful coral gardens

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Swim pet and feed these gentle creatures in their natural environment. You have to do this once!! The water is waist deep and anyone can do this. Our kids are 6 9 and 12....and all loved it!! We got great pictures and had a fabulous family experience. Check out Chip with Stingray Sailing....awesome catamaran for snorkeling and stingrays!

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We took the 7am small group (10 people) adventure from the Reef resort (leaves from Kaibo Grill). Snorkel a bit and then go to the sandbar to walk/swim among the sting rays. Very nice!!!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Awesome! Go during the early morning or during a quiet time and you will have the place to yourself. I heard that if you go when it is busy there are too many boats and people to fully enjoy the trip.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,These stingrays are amazing animals. Take a small excursion such as the Six Senses Eco Tour so you are not on a huge boat full of people. You will want the best human to stingray ratio you can get.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Absolutely beautiful and crazy fun! It was a little freaky at first but was so neat to have them swimming all around you. Booked with Cayman Eco Adventures. Definitely recommend them. Only had about 16 on our boat compared to 45-100. Capt. Kevin very friendly. Snorkeled after feeding the stingrays. It was beautiful. Must do!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,The guys on the boat were tremendous and then the stingrays and the water was beyond belief!!! The sting rays even kissed some of the boat mates!!!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We went snorkeling with the Red Sails trip and had a great time. The screw was very friendly and it was amazing to touch and kiss a stingray.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,loveddd this excursion!! sooo neat and fun to play with the sting rays and the guides were awesome and so well knowledged! they really made you feel comfortable too!!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,What an amazing experience we had with the stingrays. It feels strange at first having them swim all around you but they are such beautiful creatures that you lose the fear that you may feel. This is by and far a must do when in the Caymans.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We had a fantastic time with Captain Chip and his crew during our day to Stingray City. We highly recommend their company and experiencing the stingrays along with the great snorkeling adjacent to the stingray area.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,its like swimming in a pool! the stingrays are amazing creatures. There is nothing to fear. We went to Sunrays tours and would recommend them over Redsail as I have been on both. I would recommend going on a weekend day when the cruise ships are not there as the amount of people will inhibit the experience
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Great place to take kids. Certainly not your everyday experience! Combine the tour with another experience because you can only be thrilled with petting a stingray for so long!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,If you're going to Grand Cayman you must do this! Use Capt. Bryan's service and ask for Jake! This and snorkeling the barrier reef were highlights of the trip.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,My wife & I took a trip with Capt. Bryan's crew on the Buccaneer to Stingray City. The 3 hour tour included 2 other snorkel sites and excellent snorkel equipment. I can't say enough about the crew. They were friendly safety concious and professional. Highly recomended.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,I have had my 5th trip out with Cayman Eco to stingray city and snorkeling around the reef. Not only an exhilarating trip it is educational. The staff is welcoming and super friendly they keep the passengers at a minimum so you have room to move about the the boat not packed in like sardines! ABSOLUTELY a FIVE STAR trip!!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,My daughter and I visited Stingray City twice in 2 days and didn't regret it...the stingrays were such fun to watch and play with. Both tours were great...with snorkeling afterward at the reef. Got to see cushion sea stars on the first trip out as well.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,If you are going to Grand Cayman do not miss this. I have never swum with dolphins but imagine this must be better as these creatures are in the wild. It is truly awesome to have these huge fish swim around you and let you touch them. It has to be the best experience with wildlife i have ever had.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We took an excursion through our Cruise ship to sting ray city. WE have 5 kids and they all loved this. We snorkled with the sting rays got to hold them feed them and my son even got to kiss one. Beautiful place about waist deep clear water. AMAZING would do this again.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Although it can be crowded with several boat loads of people it was an experience that shouldn't be missed. Got to hold a stingray in my arms with others swimming around our legs.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Lots of fun for kids and family unforgettable experience.very soothing lots of fun. A must if your are traveling to Grand Cayman!!

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,My husband and I took the afternoon sail to the Stingray Bar and then snorkelling. Simon and Dexter were very accommodating and made sure everyone had time with the stingrays. It was very relaxing and special attention to those of us not so confident.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,This was such a wonderful experience!!! Dexter and Simon were alot of fun and very social. They even help you if you need assistance to get in and out of the boat. The Stingrays were friendly and truly loved to interact. I highly reccommend DEXTERS!!!!!! We were also offered beverageslifejackets.and scuba gear if desired for snorkeling.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Snorkeling with huge southern rays all around you feeding them out of your hands and then more snorkeling at the beautiful coral gardens reef is something you should not miss if you come to the Caymans!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Swim with the stingrays even ok for non swimmers water is not overly deep out on a sand barable to hold and touch the stingrays
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,A unique experience. The day we visited the water was rough don't know for sure if it was due to weather or the many boats skidoos and visitors. Was neat to see and touch sting rays and there were many. I would say neat adventure to experience at least once.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We went out to Stingray City with friends in their boat and it is truly amazing to see these huge Stingrays and be able to swim with them and to feed them with fish taken out by some of the larger boats.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We did this as a 3 part excursion on Carnival. It was cool to go to the sandbar and be in their natural environment! Usually excursions have a cheesy forced feel but this was nice.

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Step off your boat into shallow water and be surrounded by stingrays. It is well worth the visit especially when combined with snorkelling nearby. Bring your waterproof camera as the photos done by the excursion company are pricey.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Had a wonderful time feeding squid to sting rays. "Phsycho" the eel made an appearance which made it extra special. Once in a lifetime experience.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Unique experience for all ages. If you enjoy being in the water a first-hand visit with the stingrays is a must. They are extremely friendly and fun to swim with!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Once in a lifetime; can't wait to do it again! Mario at Acquarius Sea Tours made this an unforgettable outing for us. We will def do this again with Mario on our next visit to the Caymen Is. If you go to the Caymen Is. and don't do this; you missed out on something incredible.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Took a tour to stingray city with Soto's Cruises they were very professional. This excursion was a self done trip not by the cruiselines. The price was half what the cruise line wanted. I highly recomend Soto's Cruises.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,If you haven't swam with the stingrays yet go do it! I've been twice and both times I just can't get over how cool it is! The water is only waist deep so no swimming or snorkeling skill involved.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Try and get yourself on an all day trip on a smaller boat with an experienced captain. If you do you will never regret it!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We visited here in Oct 2012 on a cruise so we did not do it again on the next visit. This place was awesome. At first I was scared I was going to be killed like the crocodile hunter! They guides were friendly knowledgeable and the Rays were gentle and easy going. This was alot of fun
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,This was amazing. I couldn't believe how large and friendly these stingrays were. It was neat to be able to get into the water with them and have them brush up alongside you.

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,I spent a 3-4 hours on-site and thoroughly enjoyed myself. I brought a snack but each charter comes with some sort of package. Bring your camera!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Great experience if you are visiting Grand Cayman. You won't see anything else like it in the Caribbean. Great for kids and adults!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,My family loved the whole time we were at sting ray city. it was the best time ever. we cant wait untill next year.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Loved the catamaran ride snorkeling and the sting rays were amazing!!! A very relaxing day trip! Cant wait to go back!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,The water is so beautiful. Snokeling the coral reefs are exciting. The trip is well planned very safe. And the experience touching and feeding the stingrays is awesome.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We had the good fortune of sailing with Stingray Sailing twice during our stay on Grand Cayman. I had been to Sting Ray City about a dozen times and this charter was by far the best we've ever used. Whether arriving by ship or staying on the island you can't go wrong with Stingray Sailing-they're great!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,The ride out to Stingray City on the catamaran was delightful but is nothing compared to swimming with the stingrays and being able to feed them and touch them it was really cool and very fun. If you are in Grand Cayman it is a must to go out to stingray city!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,This was our first outing on the vacation. We learned the big rays are female. The boat and staff of Red Sail are incredible and gracious hosts. The rays are very friendly and you do not need to fear them. Non swimmers can safely do this.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Stand in 3 feet of water to rub hold or feed stingrays. Liked everything about this activity. Make sure seas are calm before booking.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,They just want so much attention and come right up to you. You can even hug them and let them swim all over you
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,The boat from the Grand Caymanian leaves early so we were the first people to the site. The stingrays were hungry but friendly. Then we went to beautiful reef for snorkeling.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,A definite must when visiting the island! I suggest you visit on the weekend as many cruise ships visit during the week and it is very crowded then. We had the area pretty much to ourselves and feed and held a number of the rays as well as snorkeled. Don't need to swim............don't miss it!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,this place was nice and clean. Much nicer than in Jamaica. We didn't participate in the activities as we had done those before. We mainly browsed through the souvenir shop which was really nice.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We took Captain Marvin's to SR City. Take a late afternoon boat to avoid the cruise ship crowds. Having stingrays brush up against you and to handle them is an unreal experience. I was scared but glad that I did it. This is a must do activity. The snorkeling stops afterwords were also well worth it.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,that is good for a 4. You also don't need to know how to swim and water is warm. It's very safe. Go in the afternoon because lots of cruise ships have trips in the morning.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Booked with Capain Dexters Fantasea Tour. On catamaran=FUN!!! Get up close and personal rays-- can kiss them hold them and get a massage!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Awesome to smin in with the stingrays but get their early because it gets somewhat crowded fast go before 1pm.

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,This was a highlight of our trip. Once the guides throw out the feed bucket there are stingrays everywhere. It is a bit itimidating at first but you get used to them being all around you. It is an experience you will remember.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Loved loved loved the way I got to experience stingray city. None of those double decker ram packed boats for me! We did a half day trip with a Jacques Cousteau naturalist from the ritz. Only 4 of us on the boat plus our guide. Stingray city plus snorkeling to starfish point. Amazing. A must do in cayman!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Went with Captain Shaun of Seven Seas charter and it was the highlight of our tour of Grand Cayman! The sandbar was cool and the rays were SO amazing!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,It was great and one of the 'DON'T MISS' attractions on the island... I'm actually trying to teach my 3yo to snorkel so he can go... one of the coolest life experiences for everyone. Don't come to Cayman without experiencing this!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Petting 'tame' stingray? What's not to like? The 'sailing crew' were extremely friendly fun and informative. You could get in the water and snorkle or just stay on the boat and enjoy from a distance.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We traveled by bus to a boat that took us to the area with the stingray. The crew was great and made sure everyone had several chances to touch/hold/feed them. This excursion is a must for anyone going to Grand Cayman!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,It was very cool having the stingrays swim all around you and to feed them. But it was disturbing to me how much the guides picked up the rays and had the tourists pick them up for photos. I am sure this is not goof for them. It is worth the trip out there (bring your snorkel mask)
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,At first I was a little nervous because the stingrays were huge! It was a little crazy because when you have the food for the stingrays they all come to you at once but it was fun! My family and I went on a private boat with Big Chris who was so great! Definitely a cool experience
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We used Cayman Tours on a private boat tour which is defintely the way to go! Great crew that takes a lot of photos and they are very personable. Highly recommend going to Sting Ray city....one of a kind place.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Was a great ride out to the sand bar and great time seeing stingrays up close!! Would do it again and is a must do on Grand Cayman
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,This was absolutely one of the most enjoyable things to see in Grand Cayman! Make sure you take your underwater camera out with you or you are with a guide that will take your photo as well as making sure you take the stingrays food so they will surround you and allow you to touch/hold/kiss them...VERY cool!!!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Who would think of petting Stingrays ... Wow unique experience ... Must see must do !!!!! Snorkeling in shallow waters feeding them .... Surrounded by them sooo cool

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,snorkling was awesome. Would have liked more time there. Swimming with stingrays was also wonderful.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,This was probably one of the coolest experiences ever! We took a catamaran out to Stingray City where we got out and got up close and personal with the Stingrays. We got to hold them feed them kiss them and even get back massages from them! A++ this is a must see if you are visiting Grand Cayman!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We just got back from a family Christmas vacation went to stingray city it was great the waves were a little rough for our 10 year old but other then that would highly recommend. a must do for anyone that enjoys the water snorkeling or scuba divers will enjoy.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,What I loved about this tour is the stingrays are in their natural environment and they CHOOSE to come to you. The stingrays are very sociable and it really is a once in a lifetime experience.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Something you must do in your life might as well take a catamaran with the most professional helpful and nicest crew...
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We are not ones to do the typical touristy stuff...but this was an excellent family experience. The Stingrays are as friendly as puppies!!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,This was an amazing experience. The stingray's are very social and they seem love the attention. They will "climb" all over you if you let them. I'd love to do this again someday.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,In addition to a unique experience with stingrays the clear blue water surrounding Stingray City is stunningly beautiful.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We went to Stingray City and it is clearly a top highlight of our time on Grand Cayman and ranks up there with any excursion we have taken during our travels. If you're visiting Grand Cayman this is a must do event and I highly recommend you go out with Moby Dick!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We took a catamaran from Rum Point with Red Sail Sports. Ti was a 2 1/2 hour trip with about 45 minutes with the stingrays. The guys form Red Sail were great with plenty of time to take pictures with the stingrays. Be aware it is a cash bar on the boat.

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We did a stingray and snorkel tour while in Grand Cayman last week. Stingray City was a lot of fun. There were a lot of rays swimming around us. I would recommend to book the afternoon tour if there are cruise ships on the island the morning tour maybe have more people.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Fun easy "dive" to end the week...great photo ops!! Friendly tame stingrays simple dive lots of feeding...FUN!!

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,You can't go Grand Cayman and not go here. The rays act like pets and the guides are infomative. There's no place where you can personally interact touch hold and even kiss a stingray. Why would anyone pass up this opportunity.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,This is a must see in GC but not worth the money/aggrevation for diving. For instance there are many divers on top of each other in 10 ft of water. Instead you should just snorkel it. Stingrays are friendly and it is not at all scary (so take your KIDS!)
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Totally worth it. Professional and well done. The guides understood care of the animals and really helped tourists.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Just go with responsible operators like Fat Fish so that you can maximize your experience and get the full-blown stingray experience -- right down to a stingray massage :-)
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,I have been to Stingray City before on one of the small boats but this year took a jet ski across from the resort. It was great. We were able to stay as long as we wanted to and were not on anyone else's schedule. It is an awesome experience interacting with the stingrays.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,This is one of the best experiences on Cayman. Ask your tour guide when you can avoid the cruise ship crowds tho! We used Acquarius Sea Tours and they were excellent and got us to the site just as all the crowds were leaving so we had the stingrays to ourselves. Don't miss it!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Stingray City was a memorable activity for all of our family members. There was no shortage of stingrays to kiss and touch! We went with Duncan's Tours and we were all very pleased with our visit. The staff were great and eager to help the kids hold and kiss the sting rays! A place not to be missed.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Once in a lifetime experience. Out in ocean on a sandbar no need to swim. Can stand in chest high water and watch out! Here they come. Beautiful majestic sting rays. Can touch them as they brush right up against your legs. Don't forget to kiss one-7 years good luck!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We went 1992 and were mobbed by all the stingrays. Went this year and saw 3 and the green eel was a little aggressive. It's still a good dive but the coral and sting ray city just weren't what they were in the past.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,This is a must in Cayman. Do the dive and not the sandbar if possible. Take care when feeding them the yellow tail snappers are really aggressive to steal the squid from your hands first.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We did a family trip to Sting Ray City and had a great time. The only downside was the stingrays were not hungry as there have been so many visitors over the holidays.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Swimming with the rays is an absolute thrill. Bring your underwater camera for the most amazing pics.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Amazing to share with such huge sea creatures far out in the ocean on a sand bar in North Sound. Everyone goes with trepidation and comes home with wonderful memories of the experience.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Wow they are amazing - don't miss snorkeling on the nearby reef too!! We went with 6 senses eco tour
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,This is a must do for anyone visiting grand cayman. We took a trip with Captain Marvin's tour. Fed the stingrays pet them snorkeled the barrier reef and just had an overall great time.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Very different experience. Not to be missed. We did a dawn trip with Ocean Frontiers which avoided the crowding of multiple boats.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Like trained lions these enormous creatures know it's chow time when they see the boats come in. It is worth making it out to see them at least once. You do get to interact with them if your boat captain brings the squid. Remember to kiss them for 7 years good luck.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,if you are not gonna go out diving or snorkelling on your own then this is a must see. I loved the close interaction with an animal i rarely even see. there are deals for this to be found online and in coupon books found at the hotel ect.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,The your was as advertised. We enjoyed it. I would recommend this to others. Chip was very knowledgable and let us spend plenty of time at stingray city.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Great experience. Crew was great. Would highly recommend this tour. My eight year loved it. We visited Grand Cayman while we were on a carnival cruise and did this excursion loved every minute of it.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,You haven't had a real stringray encounter until you've visited Stringray city. The whole experience was amazing. I strongly encourage you do your research and try to find a tour that's off the beaten track (smaller groups). Makes for a great intimate experience.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Really really cool experience! This was my husband favorite activity we did on the trip. Great experience and good for kids and adults!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,So many stingrays and clear water!! GREAT TIME snorkeling..The Stingrays come right up to you and you can feed them.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Being in the ocean with these creatures was an amazing experience! Touching them was even more amazing.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Once In a lifetime experience. Lots of fun. Safe. Friendly. Great deals if you go with sun rays tours (Italian team).
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Swimming with the string rays is a pretty amazing experience and we enjoyed a nice ride out from Rum Point on the Red Sail catamaran.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,I liked the glass bottom boat. It was about 1.5 hours trip. Swam with the stingray for 20 or so minutes and then snorkeled at a reef for 20 minutes. Long enough.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Good place to go if you've never been. I wouldn't go there twice. Too many great places to dive in Cayman to spend time petting stingrays...
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Lots of fun exactly like how the photos looked...got to hold several stingrays; ask around for some raw squid to feed them!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,They are so freindly like little puppies but listen to the safty talk n well worth the trip my 86 non swimming grandmother went n she stayed on the boat so fine for all ages
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,You must do this if you go to the Caymans! I had no idea they were like puppies in the water. Dont miss this amazing activity. We went with Tours Cayman.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Highly recommend Marineland tours to get there fabulous experience. The rays were awsome and even though there were some pretty large waves when we were there we were able to keep our feet on the ground as it's not at all deep. GREAT
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Been there 4 times and every time seems better. Never disappointted. Not like any other tour you'll take.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Loved going on a smaller excursion and the guides were helpful Did not like the reef we snorkeled after the stingrays
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,This trip is a must. Take a no pressure tour of the site and you will get it for free. Ddon't pass this one by.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,I liked the ocean. I disliked anything about the food. Not organized just catering to the tourists most of whom come by bus from the cruise ships. A good place for stingrays!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,This was the best trip ever. Highly recommend stingray city. Guides made sure everyone had a good time.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,I have swam with stingrays before but this was so much better. It was interactive and the guides wanted you to experience the stingrays. Our guide truly loves these creatures. I think he thinks they are his pets. Don't miss the opportunity to swing I. The beautiful cayman water and swim with these amazing creatures.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,A must do in Grand Cayman! We can't wait to go back and do it again! Awesone staff and very educational.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Absolutely amazing! A must see!!! A sand bardge out in the middle of the ocean where you are only in knee deep (to waist deep) water. Surrounded by stingrays who are waiting to eat out of your hand. Feels like a vacuum suction on your hand. It's incredible!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,I went to Stingray City with Red Sail Sports and there were many stingrays to interact with. You have the change to hold them and get you photo taken. Some are rather large but won't bother you if you don't want to interact with them. It is a fun activity and a must do on Grand Cayman.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Have been here a few times and it is so much fun! We have booked "Oh Boy" Charters - we have booked a private charter with them twice. We strongly recommend them. It is obvious that the crew (Christopher and Domingo) thoroughly enjoy their jobs. Very professional and organized yet so friendly.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Feed kiss and hold stingrays at your leisure. Cost for Dolphin Cove and Stingrays $99 dollars. Very worth it if you want an excursion. Not much to do on but shop and excursions on island.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,OMG!!!!! This was amazing. We got to touch hold feed & take pics with wild stingrays!!! They were gentle and it wasn't scary at all. You must go!!!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We booked with Red Sail Sports to visit Stingray City. It was an incredible experience. The captain and first mate were knowledgeable fun and FINE! We had a wonderful time and would do again!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Definitley go! Worth time and money. Need to be ready for stingray's to touch you and swim right by. A little intemidating at first
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,The stingrays seemed pretty aggressive and were going up to everyone for food--even people who didn't have fish to give them. They were nibbling in inappropriate places. Still I don't think you should go to Grand Cayman and not visit Stingray City--it's not something you could see anywhere else. Maybe rub some fish juice on your little brother's leg...?
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We did this snorkel as part of a 3 snorkel afternoon with Ambassador Divers & it was fantastic. This is certainly on our list of things to do again on our next trip to Grand Cayman.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We booked this tour just before we set sail on our cruise. We paid for two adults and two children for the price of one adult through the cruise line. Our tour encluded swimming with the sting rays snorkeling the reef and the starfish beach. Wondeful value and an amazing experiance!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,If you have to settle for the snorkel trip to see these playful Rays do it but if you have the good fortune to be able to scuba dive the "old" Stingray City don't miss it!!!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Love Stingray City and the tourscayman excursion was awesome! They took their time and explained everything to us and let us all handle the stingrays. The pictures they took turned out great and the price was reasonable. A must do for everybody who visits the Cayman Islands
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,The stingrays were a lot of fun and friendly. We saw other cool fish and found a huge sea shell. Nice sand and clear water.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Took Stingray Sailing with Capt. Chip and crew! Loved it! My 12yo is till talking about it and wants to know when we are going back which we will! Take a smaller company like we did and you will have a much better experience!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,wonderful experience. No swimming experience needed--shallow sand bar very safely done. Something you will never forget.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Always a great treat. A definite must if this you haven't visited. Enjoyed feeding the stingray. I don't swim but still felt safe and enjoyed this trip.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,If you love the outdoors if you love nature if you are amazed by and love ocean life...this place is for you! What an amazing experience to get up close and personal with such beautiful graceful creatures. Get over your fears you'll be happy you tried it ;)

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,I take al my visitors here - you have to do this! Either use the red sail or one of the many likened excursions or better yet find a friend with a boat and head to Kiabo afterwards for mudslides!

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,I never saw nature that way wild and free! Beatiful!!! Stingrays are ver friendly and safety!! BLAST!!!! You must see it!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We booked this on our Carnival Cruise and it was the highlight of our trip. The people of Don Foster Diving were incredible and we will defintely see them again.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,There are many ways to connect to the Rays! BoatSail.Jet Ski.... Take a yacht! We climbed a board Big John from Acquarius and it was Fabulousmore personal and much more relaxing!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,trust me you don't want to miss this experience it definately was one of the highlights of our trip.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,A definite must for all - even our 3 year old daughter. Staff was wonderful and we all kissed the stingrays.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Wicked experience! The rays here are extremely gentle and comfortable around humans. If you want an up close view of these wild animals this is the place to do it!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We recently went to Stingray City with Stingray Sailing. We were the only ones on Captain Chip's "Far Tortuga" boat and the only boat on-site. Loved it! Highly recommend Stingray Sailing and Captain Chip.

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,A "Must Do" in the Caymans... It's a little scary at first when the Stingray's swim by and brush up against you... It is amazing seeing them in their natural habitat... My husband enjoyed holding one.. Glad we did this tour...

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Lovely trip only issue those bad jacks stole my squid before I could feed the big soft bodied rays! My girlfriend made out with one now I must kiss her lips eww
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Did not want to go there but it ended up being pretty neat I was scared but it a cool thing to do after all!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We had a great time here. The staff did a great job. They were knowledgeable and patient. The made approaching and handling of stingrays easy.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,What an experience!!! Although i was too afraid to get in the water with the sting ray it was an exciting scene!!! The water was so beautiful and crystal clear. The sting ray seemed really friendly and my boyfriend enjoyed dancing with them. I well definitely go back on the boat ride to watch them again!!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Love feeling the sting rays. Their skin is so smooth unlike what you would imagine. The guides help you catch them and you can take pictures holding them. Love this!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,so cool. How many people have been body-slammed by a stingray?? It's really an amazing experience feeding squid to these huge insistent creatures. Best to be confident in the water I think but I would highly recommend it.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,After getting a bit freaked out that they kept coming straight to me it was amazing. You can hold them get kisses from them or just watch. We saw huge ones as well as baby ones. It was a great experience.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,The shallow water at Stingray City is great for people who don't swim well and want to experience the stingrays up close and personal. They were very calm and friendly brushing up against our legs and looking for food. Very cool experience!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,This was a great trip...we went with Jetski Fishing & Safaris ($175 for a pair on one Jetski). We got to take jetskis to the site and also snorkel on the reef nearby. It's definitely a must see! The tour was great and the staff super friendly! Wouldn't miss it!!!!

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,I have been travelled all over the world for both work and pleasure and this is in the top 5 most amazing things I have ever done. To be able to swim with and hold these massive creatures is something else! Are guides were very informative and we always felt safe.

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Sipping an ice cold beer while standing on the sand bank with stingrays swimming around your feet is an experience never forgotten. Heaven.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Rum Point was way over rated not worht the time to many signs on what you are NOT to do but had to take the catermeran from their dock to stingray city
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Go here it is so worth the cost. And it is probably the best water experience on the island. The guides are very helpful and easy going -- Get a pix with the stingrays!!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,On our first trip the weather never permitted us to do this trip but on the second visit we did! Just absolutely loved being in the water with the stingrays feeding them touching them!!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,wild beautiful...went with Captain Marvin's crew Vernon was our guide. 3 stops...sting ray city snorkeling at the reef and snorkeling with tropical fish. Then on the way back Vernon jumped off the boat and brought up star fish for photo ops. Not many people on our trip. Amazing!!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,booked with Captain Marvin's exellent hightly recomended!!!! this is absolutely not to miss one of the best experience you could have!

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Everyone in our family loved visiting Stingray City. To see such amazing creatures up close and in their own environment was really magical.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We used Stingray Sailing (StingraySailing.com) and I would highly recommend them. The crew was great and we were with a smaller group which meant you got more help holding the stingrays. Also they really do seem to attract more stingrays than other boats as they bring food out.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,This is something i think anyone would enjoy. My 3 year old had as much fun as I did! We went with Dexter's Fantasea Tours and were very happy with them. Highly highly recommend.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Friendly stingrays everywhere that you get to feed squid to. Water is standing depth in most areas. Take a small tour operator like sunray tours and stay away from the cattle boats that cater to cruise ships.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,What a cool experience! I have a new appreciation for rays after having them swimming all around me and my kids! Stroking their skin and being so up close and personal with them was so neat. Doing this experience as a dive was better than I would imagine a snorkel would have been.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Even with all of the hype this is definitely a worthwhile adventure and we were thrilled we went. I would go through Sun Ray tours. They were excellent tour guides and the boat is awesome (and not crowded).
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We had a private trip with just my family and the guide. Had the stingrays to ourselves with no crowds to fight. I highly recommend this attraction.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We had the pleasure of booking through Jackie's water sports and taking out Captain Marvin's boat out. What an amazing crew and family adventure. Visited String Ray City then two addional snorkeling stops. Lots of fish not too many people and learned so much. Thanks for the amazing time. This is one we are sure to recommend.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,If you want to see nature live go here!! And bring goggles! The dolphin cove is the best value you can literally go to stingray city for free if you sign up for the dolphin swim!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,The crew were very helpful and friendly. The one crew member helped my daughter hold and kiss a stingray! They are very interactive with the stingrays and guests.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,There aren't many places in the world where you can be in the water with large stingrays swimming up to you. Great experience and surprisingly not scary!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,This was one of the most memorable moments of our trip. To feed and hold the stingrays and feel their skin was like nothing else. Our entire group had a great time as the stingrays flitted past our feet and legs and the water was the clearest I've ever seen. Amazing is all I can say.

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,It is a wonderful feeling to interact with these gentle graceful creatures. Quite breathtaking! Those who want to can feed them with squid or cradle them in their arms. They are so tame and friendly.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,

g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Nice couple of hours spent with stingray sailing. We went with a catamaran and could touch kiss and feed the stingrays.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Loved this experience! Best done by certified divers who are not shy about getting up close and personal with sea life.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,We went with Don Foster's...this is a one tank dive...shallow (12 feet) for about an hour. Feeding the tame stingrays and the photo op's = fantastic experience for the whole family!!!
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Red Sail guys were super cool & the rays are amazing!! It was a little scary at first but the rays are gentle & so soft a "must do" for everyone espeacially on a catamaran.
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,The sailboat there was beautiful blue skies and ocean very relaxing. Stingray city is on a sandbar loaded with stingrays. You can even feed them. They are gentle and graceful creatures. It was a day we will remember forever! The guides were very friendly.
g147365,d2198364,February 29 2016,
g147365,d2198364,March 2 2016,Not very impressed with this excursion. Not worth the money. The pictures are overpriced. Although you can take your own pictures if you have a waterproof camera. Wouldn't do this again. I'd rather go snorkeling.
g147365,d2198364,February 29 2016,Our tour with Six Senses Eco Tour included a stop here and it was fascinating. Shallow water easy to stand in and easy to feed or touch the sting rays. The Sting Rays were friendly but not aggressive.
g147365,d2198364,February 29 2016,If you find yourself on Grand Cayman definitely make the trip out to Stingray City. We went with Moby Dick Tours and were not disappointed. Smaller groups and great owner/leaders.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,This was my third time there and really enjoyed this time due to perfect weather with a fairly small crowd. There were no cruise ships in town the day we went.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Good fun for the entire family. Everyone knows about Sting Ray City for good reason. Even for accomplished divers it is worth it.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,You have to try it. My review will not do justice to the experience. Standing on the sandbar with 1 foot to 4 foot stingrays eating from your hand is incredible.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,

g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,There were so many stingrays I had to watch where I stepped. Make sure you bring squid to feed them. They will eat right out of your hand. Simply an unbelievable experience!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Great time there. Kissed the stingray for 7 years of good luck according to the islanders. If you've never done it it's a must. This was my second time there and it was just as good as the first. Can't wait to come back to do it again.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Stingrays right next to you eating squids right out of your hand. Water was warm and clear and could see the stingrays and other fish while standing in water. Snorkeling afterwards was great.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Wasn't sure if I would enjoy this but wanted to try.... Water is waist high... stingrays very friendly and used to people. I was a little overwhelmed by the number of rays. but glad I did it. Would recommend for all ages.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Went on an excursion with Captains Marvin's...The guides were great; the stingrays were SO cool and SO interactive especially if you had squid pieces. One large ray had no tail; they called her Frisbee! Loved the interaction!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,We have been to GC many times and the one thing we always do is go to stingray city! We took a boat through Acquarius out of the Cayman Yacht Club and it was a fantastic day!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,We love love stingray city. What a fun opportunity to be in their natural environment and watch them peacefully swim around. A must do while in Cayman!!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Amazing experience well run! Professional dolphins seemed happy people were very nice. Photos are expensive get tickets from Cayman Activity Center much cheaper for ultimate dolphin experience.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,We went on a non-cruise ship day and there were very few people. I would highly recommend finding out when the cruise ships dock. Usually they are mid-week and not weekends.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,We had the best time! One of the best attractions the island has to offer! This definitely made our trip worthwhile! The Snorkeling after the stingrays was a must see!

g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,It's something you can only experience in Grand Cayman! Aside from the encounter with these wonderful creatures it's truly a beautiful place with water that is so clear it's unimaginable.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,If you are going to the Cayman Islands you HAVE to do this tour. The stingrays are huge and not afraid of human contact. You also snorkel along a very nice reef after you leave the stingray sandbar. The reef was truly beautiful and we got excellent pictures.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,I've been more times than I can count. It's unique and every visitor we've taken has loved it! I enjoy it each time myself!

g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Our tour was with RedSail tour company. Jimmy our boat handler & guide was informative and Novelette his helper were fun to be with.

g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Beautiful catamaran trip. Friendly crew. Good information about the tip from dive shop ladies Wendy (extremely nice) and Laura (new).

g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,You have to do it for the ocean's experience with stingrays: no fear at all just fun.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Nothing like it...very fun and a must do. They come up on you and are extremely friendly.

g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,It was the most amazing experience swimming with such amazing creatures!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,it's true what they say in Cayman. No where else in the world can you find a place like this. Its so fun to hold wild stingrays.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,This is an annual Must do when I travel to Cayman every year. Try to go after the cruise ships have left for the day less people after 2:00 p/m. Book with Red Sail Sports the crew is awesome
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,You will never forget this experience. Go with Sun Ray Tours. They are great!!!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,It's hard to describe the experience and do it justice. There are very few vacation experiences that are so incredible that I would turn around and do the same exact thing day after day but I could easily visit the stingray sandbar everyday! The stingrays are magnificant creatures - and oh so friendly. This is a must do experience!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,we took a small boat (approx 45 min) out to the Stingray Sandbar - water was rough due to TS Debby but still worth the experience. Kiss a stingray....have 7 years of good luck!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,We only did two activities while on the island as this was one of them. A great interaction with the stingrays and the water is beautiful.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Loved the stingray city trip and would like to do it again. We went on a calm day and had a blast. Lots of stingray around and not many other boats that day.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Very neat shallow water to stand up in the middle of the ocean! Hold a ray in your hand! They feel softer than butter! Amazing. Best to go on a sunny day but good any day. Big tourist deal on water.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Awesome crew with amazing experience and knowledge of the stingrays. Great with children and was perfect for my 2 year old. Great for all age ranges and even for those with physical disabilities. Get to hold and kiss a stingray (7 years good luck according to the crew) And overall an unforgettable experience!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,This is the experience of a lifetime ... if you do only one thing this is it.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,a lot of excursions include this place and is an excellent option for kids and addults
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Outstanding trip...take the time and you won't be disappointed!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,We went to Stingray City through a private boat tour with Fat Fish Adventures. The water is beautiful and we were surrounded with the sweet gentle rays. We were able to pet feed and kiss the rays. It was an amazing time! I'm ready to go back.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,I was skeptical that this would be a tourist trap (and a bit nervous about being surrounded by stingrays) but it really turned out to be the highlight of the trip for us. Strongly recommended. See pictures for some cool shots of the stingrays.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,I can't visit Grand Cayman without going to stingray city..I just can't. It is one of my favorite places on this earth probably my most favorite. A sand bar in the middle of the most beautiful shade of blue water surrounded by these gentle gliding creatures. Pure bliss!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Loved it. Loved it. Loved it! Took Seven Seas Charters and was educated about the stingrays and their sandbar. Wish we had time to do this more than once on our trip!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Stingray City is a MUST if you visit Grand Caymon!! It is great for adults and children. The Stingrays are very friendly and ready to eat the food you have for them!!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,This place is so cool and was definitely the highlight of going to grand cayman
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Take Jet Skis from Ebanks Water sports. Great value & guide is fantastic!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,I never get tired of the experience great for friends from Wisconsin
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,This was our 2nd visit to Sting Ray City. We love the catamaran ride and being in the water with the sting rays.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,I was nervous at the thought of being in the water with these huge rays but it was an experience of a lifetime! I'm so glad I got over my fear and got to swim with these gorgeous creatures. The water in Grand Cayman is perfection!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,We went here with Sun Rays Tours and loved it! Can't wait to go back!!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,The stingrays are everywhere! Big and small very cool. They will eat right out of your hands. Great area for snorkling as well.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Pick your tour operator wisely. We saw some poorly maintained boats. Our catamaran was in perfect condition and the well trained. If I were to go again I would rent the jet ski tour.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Went to the shallow part and it was just so plesant to interact with the rays. I didn't feed them so their interest in me wasn't great but they bumped me gently without fear.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,We took the catamaran tour to snorkel at one of the shallow reefs and the sandbar at Stingray City. Nice experience but as an experienced snorkeler and diver not the best place to snorkel. Stingrays were of course the highlight (a little pricey).
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,We just did a tour to sting ray city with our kids through dolphin cove. If you book a dolphin encounter with them you receive a free tour to sting ray city. We went with our 8 and 10 year old kids. It was amazing and it felt so safe. I will definitely do it again if we come back.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,We went on a jet ski tour with Fat Fish. It was really cool. Keep in mind stingray city is an area on a sand bar in the middle of the water not a theme park or building. It is serviced by many providers. We recommend Fat Fish they were great.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Chip and his crew run a first class operation. Awesome day with them saw the stingrays and did the snorkeling. Our group loved it. The highlight of our vacation.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Once in a lifetime experience. The sandbar is shallow enough for older children and the rays are friendly. I am personally a water and animal-shy person so I wanted to do it but was honestly scared. My husband coaxed me in and I ended up loving it even asked our tour leader to allow me to hold them twice!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,So much fun! I was timid at first but you're completely safe. Book with Fat FIsh -- Richard was a blast!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Got to swim with the stingrays and hold them. Sophie was a popular stingray and we had our picture taken with her and holding her. Fantastic. No quite enough time to spend with them.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,It was absolutely amazing. I never felt in danger or threatened. What an amazing time definately a must do. We used Marvins tours and had a great time. The 2 snorkle spots were great too.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,It is a must do if you go to the cayman islands. It is a once in lifetime experience.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,We opted for the Jet Ski trip with Fat Fish. As it turned out the three in our party were the only ones on the tour. Richard was the guide and made the trip enjoyable.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,This is no amusement park attraction. You're standing in the ocean with a bunch of huge stingrays swimming around you and it was surreal. I was daunted at first no doubt but I quickly developed an appreciation for how graceful these animals are. So soft and so beautiful. Truly an adventure I will never forget.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,The site is a short boat ride. You stand on a sandy reef and the sting rays are plentiful. Yu are allowed to touch and the guides give you food to feed them. It is a very different and enjoyable experience for the entire family
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,A visit to Stingray City is a definite MUST DO when in the Caymans!!! Hold a stingray experience the soft velvety feel of a stingray backrub snorkel with stingrays....all absolutely AMAZING experiences with these gentle creatures!!!!! And most importantly give that stingray a little kiss for 7 years good luck!!!!! Cross this off your bucket list :)))
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Amazing creatures in a picture perfect sand bar made for an unforgettable excursion. Must do in Grand Cayman!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,We loved the tour beautiful blue water lots for stingrays we got to feed hold and see lots of rays not to many people in the area definitely a lifetime experience for sure.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,I was afraid to see the stingrays. Now I love them. They are gentle and love people..the boat has drinks .. The guides are knowledgable at Captain Marvin's
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Beautiful water and fun swimming and snorkeling with the sting rays. The tour guides took great care of us and made it such an enjoyable experience for us.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,This journey is amazing. The 25 minute ride to the sandbars. The water is crystal clear and the stingrays are amazing. Enjoy feeding them and getting pictures with your family
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,We took the opportunity to go here after we were out on a fishing trip with Slack Em Fishing. Captain John made it a very unique experience for us!! Thank you!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Even though the weather was overcast the tour was reasonable and fun. We not only went to fishermans reef to snorkle and the stingray sand barbut this tour also included a trip to the turtle farm.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Denise from Blue Hole Divers made it fun for everyone. We are glad she warned us of a potential visit from an eel. Although he wasn't dangerous it could have been a suprise.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,We went with a group with Diver's Down and it was fantastic!! It was surreal having the stingrays coming right up to me.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,This is a sandbar where you can stand while the stingrays swim around you. Snorkel or just stand either way it is an amazing experience. Put your arms out and they will swim into them. There are many tour operators to pick from.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,We took a tour to Stingray City with Sosto Cruises. These guys are top notch and really know how to handle the stringrays for optimum interaction with them. Warm shallow water can be a bit crowded with tourists great photo ops with the stingrays.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,I was a bit freaked out at first but Capt Jimmy was so good with the String Rays and mad us all feel very comfortable-even my 4 year old who feed them.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Hanging out with the stingrays in Stingray City was an unbelievable experience. The water is very shallow and the stingrays are abundant. They will swim right by you or even brush past you to get through. It was tons of fun petting holding and playing with the stingrays. It is an experience like no other!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Liked Captain Clinton and the small number of passengers on his boat.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,This is the coolest thing ever! the stingrays are so smart and friendly! if you cant dive it than snorkel but what ever you do dont miss it!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Amazing!!! Best experience with a shore excursion off of a cruise ship that I have had.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,great attraction that you just "have to do." i would recommend a private charter so you have some room to move around. If you can get over the fact that you are actually swimming with stingrays you will have a blast.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Don't need to be a swimmer. Safe. Can book directly and save some money.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Dexter's Fantasea Tours was excellent. The catamaran is smaller so you get more personalized service. The price is right!Dexter is a great guy and will make the experience FUN!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,We rode jet skis to the stingray sandbar. It was incredible feeding and touching the stingrays. The water was crystal clear and about 3ft deep and bottom was white sand I would definitely do it again.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,I loved interacting with the rays. Unlike all the other Red Sail dives the Stingray City dive was a bit over-crowded. We had to take turns suiting up
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,A must do on the Cayman. Great day/trip swimming with loads of docile sting rays. Glad we went.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Just had a great time very unique experience. You can't imagine having live Stingrays all around you in the middle of the ocean. Not like a dolphin experience in a cage.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,This was such a unique interaction! Make sure you buy the video pictures alone are not enough to describe this experience!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,We went to Stingray City with Captain Marvin's and it was great. We all got in the water but I personally got out a little too fast because it was scary but everyone else I was with really enjoyed it. It's a Must To Do while in Grand Cayman. Kiss the stingray for 7 years good luck!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Do not miss this experience. It was well worth it.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Everyone has to feed a stingray once in their life! A great experience!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,I never thought you could swim and snorkel with huge stingrays with such ease! A memorable thing to do; you must try this. The kids will love it!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Great way to interact with nature that would normally be dangerous. The rays are very tame and friendly.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Red Sail Sport Catamaran Run to Sting Ray was a total thrill! What an incredible experience & such beautiful creatures!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,was scared but didn't want the experience up and so glad I didn't chicken out!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Great for kids family and adults. Beautiful fun trip. Would do it again and again in a minute!!!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,We took the Red Sail Sports catamaran from Rum Point and it was well-worth the extra money to have the experience of sailing out to the sand-bar snorkeling the reef then spending almost an hour with the beautiful and gentle rays. It was the only "touristy" thing we did the whole trip and the kids loved it!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Hanging out to have your dive instructors bring the rays to you. I love them!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Go on a day when there are very few or no cruise ships in because it can get crowded. It was a nice experience feeding the rays and getting to see starfish and turtles too.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,What an experience diving with the stingrays feeding them squid in 12 feet of water!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,It was unlike anything we had ever done!! Cathy was instrumental in telling us about Stingray City. She was also very helpful in helping us get into the ocean from the boat!!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,I loved it all Awesome experience Grand Cayman was beautiful we only did this excursion and went to Tiki Beach.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,This is awesome for anyone. It was my second trip and I loved it as much as the first.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,the water was choppy on the day we went but the stingrays were still plentiful and were more than happy to swim up to you sdo you could pet them. Took a while to/from the sandbar whcih was the only downside.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Great experience! Took a jet ski tour to Stingray City.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,It's very busy out on the sand bar but the experience of cuddling the rays was worth it. It's very commercialised but the rays seemed to be happy though watch your fingers when you feed them.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Nice to go on a day with no cruise ships in however - the rays are more aggressive with less people feeding them. I didn't mind but my 6 year old was clinging onto me for dear life.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Once in a life time experience. Been there 5 times.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Gotta try it once. Do the dive and not the snorkel. Don't need a 2nd time though.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,loved dexter fantasea tours. great trip. stingrays beautiful and gentle
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,This must be visited its great to swim with the stingrays. Best experience. You dive in 3 meters of water and my guide from Divetech was brilliant. If your in the Cayman Islands this must be visited.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,We did the Stingray City and Coral Gardens with Soto's Cruises and had a wonderful time. Our boat only had about 18 people on it. Our captain and guide were wonderful! Stingray City is a must see in Grand Cayman and Soto's is the company to do it with.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,These sting rays are gentle and curious! Tour guides will bring food and it's a blast to have the rays come up to take it. Totally unique experience you can't miss.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Try to go on weekends or in the afternoon. Mornings have all the cruiseshippers there - it was like Coney Island on the 4th of July. Other than that the experience itself was memorable
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,A must do!! Very safe and the BEST crew!! Can not say enough great things about this tour or crew! It was beyond all our expectations!!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Scuba-dived with the stingrays and Psycho the moray eel! Amazing experience!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,We booked a snorkeling tour which included a trip to Stringray City with Ambassador Divers. Mike was our guide and it was really amazing. The rays are wild but exhibit no aggression towards people (though they are trained to beg for squid!) I highly recommend Ambassador for this tour. They were exceptional!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Fun holding and feeding (and giving a kiss) to the stingray. They swim right around your feet. Nice warm clear water.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,The stingrays are quite tame and get very close and personal. It was a great experience standing in the water with these stingrays swimming all around you.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Our catamaran trip stopped at the sandbar for about 45 min - 1 hour. The stingray are very tame and friendly. We got lots of great pictures and were able to pet and hold them. I would recommend going when there are not cruise ships on island.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,A Must-Do activity. If you go to the Caymans and don't take advantage of Stingray City you're missing out
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,

g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,We got discount tickets with Activity Centre in the Strand Mall. The company picked us up and took us to the boat. The Stingrays were playful. We also snorkeled at Coral Gardens and Starfish Sands. It was a fun time.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,These were large fish that swam right up to you looking for food like they were the family dog. If you listen to the crew and like fish this is a once in a lifetime experience.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,We took Peacemaker Charters to Stingray City. This is run by two brothers who were educated in the US. They were great! The stingray rays are very friendly and gentle. Don't miss this if you go to the Grand Cayman.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Great opportunity. Make sure to visit string ray city on dexters fantasea tours!

g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Liked going on jet ski and being close to the stingrays which were very large and gentle.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,The boat trips are pricey but it's a great opportunity to see and touch live big strays. The water is only waste deep so you can easily wade around for this experience.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,When the sun is shining the water is so beautiful nothing else matters. Good boat ride to a beautiful spot.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,This was a busy tourist attraction a must see. I did go but did not get in the water. I was a bit nervous but nothing really to be nervous of. Plenty of people out. Best to go on a day that is less windy so the waves are minimal
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,I love that there is stingray bay and two snorkeling trips but most exciting trip was stingray bay because you can feed the stingrays pet them kiss them and take a picture with them! Take my advice and try something new!

g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Unique to Cayman and definitely not to be missed. You won't forget your first time!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,You have to do it once. It's a zoo go there expecting it to be one and you will have fun. Go on a Sunday as there are no cruise ships in town and it isn't so crowded. We went on the redsail catamaran and it was fun.

g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Stingrays love you. They know you have food and treat you like a couple of little puppies. They swim right next to you touching you so that you pet them. All they want is some TLC.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,We went to the sandbar as it was more shallow.The guides from Red Sail Sports(Warren and Captn. Jimmy) were great. Getting into the water with those magnificent and gentle creatures was totally exhilarating! We held them fed them squid from our hands and touched their undersides which felt like velvet. This is a must do when visit Cayman.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Really cool experience water is about 4-5' deep and waves can get big at times. The boats will often take pictures for you but bring cash. Not all take cards.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Make sure you do this tour. The rays are very tame and the guides know what they are doing . We went on a day when only one cruise ship was in town.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,This is a fantastic experience to really appreciate how amazing these creatures are. Get up close and personal with a ray feed them pet them even have they ride on your back. You'll be shocked at how stealthily they slip up behind you. Simply amazing.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Some of the stingrays you will see here are GIANT!! I mean I am 6'2" and I could barely reach their wingspan. They are really a sight to see... you even get to kiss them for good luck! I can't wait to take my wife back!!!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,This is absolutely unbelievable ! My wife Daughter and son in-law had a great time. My wife does not like to touch fish however we all enjoyed this event and we all held a sting ray in our hands! A must do excursion! Bring the GoPro!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,We visited sting ray city with our hotel. It was a short boat ride to the middle of the ocean where we got to swim with very large but docile sting rays. We learned how to hold them and pet them. Would definitely do this again
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Where else can you swim and hand feed stingrays? The #1 must see sight in the Caymans. Be sure to go with Captain Marvin
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Rays of all sorts everywhere! We even went on a day that was very crowded (it had been closed for several days due to weather). Fed them kissed them... I would advise going to one of the earlier trips - they are hungrier then!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Is def the highlight of our whole week. We booked through Red Sail and got Captain Jimmy on the glass bottom boat. Worth the $90 US per couple.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Just beautiful great experience sparkling clear water never saw so many stingrays
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Best part of my trip! Safe and exciting boat ride too. An awesome time petting and holding the rays!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,The coolest thing about Grand Cayman... Where else in the world can you swim with kiss hug feed and get a massage from wild stingrays. Totally awesome!!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Forget swimming with dolphins--swimming with stingrays is much more exciting and better value! The stingrays are unafraid of people and will bump right into you if you are between them and food! Don't forget to kiss a stingray for 7 years good luck!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Was a great time. did the snorkel with Red Sail and had a good time. The photos they took were amazing. We had a great time.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Alot of people and we wished we could have more time there.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,It's WELL worth the $75 per person charge. We signed up with Red Sail Sports to take a catamaran to Stingray City/Coral Reef for snorkling. We met at the Westin Casuarina took a shuttle to the boat and spent a wonderful 4 hours on the water. My husband called the stingray experience "Epically cool."
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,This is a great trip to take and absolutely worth it. The sting rays are so tame they will eat out of your hand and some of them allow you to hold them. The more popular have names one of them being Frisbee ( she doesn't have her stinger ). Great trip.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,This is something that is soo worth doing if you are looking for a day excursion from a cruise. This is the second time that I have done this and was enjoyable both times.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,This was a great place to visit and a must see if you're on the island. If you go and have the time use Fat Fish Adventures for a jet ski tour. It was a blast.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,We used Captain Marvin----his company was great. Since I am a diver I wasn't interested in the two other snorkiling sites they take you to. I would have been happier to just go to stingray city and come back but if you love snorkling this is the way to go
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,We've been going on Capt Marvin since 1984 and even though Marvin doesnt go out any more the trip is still lots of fun. Big comfortable boats with lots of shade and they will take your picture with the stingrays and put on a CD for you ($45US)
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,...that stingrays are playful and love the attention of humans! We were able to feed them and even "hold" them (with coaching from the crew). A wonderful experience for kids of every age and a valuable reminder that we are all sharing the same planet no matter how different we may be.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Loved it would not miss this as a dive! The rays were every where and the water was clam nice relaxing dive and lots of fun.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Unreal experience! This is without a doubt one of the most amazing things I've ever experienced.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,The big rays were intimidating at first but you quickly learn how friendly they are! A must do for anyone visiting the Cayman islands!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,This is my third time being there and it is a blast. The water is beautiful and the marine life is amazing. It is well worth the cost and a trip you wont forget.

g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Must see very cool and kid friendly we had out 2.5 yr old grand daughter she was OK. Did the coral gardens/reef snorkel with it worth the money. Went with Capt. Marvins.....
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,You must do this! If you stay at the reef they take you for free and its regularly 75 a person!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,An absolutely fantastic experience hanging out with stingrays. Stingrays here don't disappoint you every time. They like to eat squid and take some to feed them. In fact I fed a stingray directly from my hand. It sucks the squid in your hand and swims past you. Wonderful feeling altogether!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,This was a once in a lifetime type of adventure! We went with a tour arranged by Diver's Down. They were so helpful reassuring and informative. It was truly great!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,A must see if you travel here! Go on a calm day though! The sun is best for pics in the morning! The rays are so gentle!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,I highly recommend this trip. We were really lucky because we had a calm day and the sea was like a giant pool. The string rays just came right up to us and were very friendly. This is one experience I will never forget.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,The guys runningMarine land tours were just great!! THANK YOU!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,I don't know anywhere else you can interact with wild stingrays basically in the middle of the ocean. But it can be quite crowded if a lot of cruise ship passengers decide to take the packaged tours.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Friends who had gone to the Cayman Islands told us we needed to go. We thought it might be kind of "touristy" but we went any way. Oh my goodness it was amazing. We went on a Captain Marvin's trip -- half the cost of the popular Red Sail Sports trips. It was better than we imagined.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,It was awesome! Went with Redsail on the sailboats. The rays were facinating and fun. Would do it again.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,For someone who is afraid of the water and can't swim I can't tell you how much I enjoyed this! Standing in 3 feet of water in the middle of the ocean with these wonderful creatures made me feel like a kid again! Great for young and old alike!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,This tour was arranged through the Reef. I love water and to be in the ocean with so many rays in a natural environment was amazing. Touch them - their bellys are like fleece! (something you wont otherwise see in Cayman :))
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Great time seeing Stingray City! Staff was great and friendly! They truly cared about the stingrays.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,great staff helpful full of knowledge  they explained the history of Stingray City what a treat go.The Stingray's are friendly and fun to interact with.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,We got to feed them pet them and hold them...amazing
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Went with Moby Dick Tours great crew on the trip. What a magical experience with the stingrays actually wanting to be around you. They carrass you you can feed them and hold them WOW!!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Stingrays are like cats they pay a lot of attention to you. That is until the food runs out then the stingrays are off looking for the next snack. One of the best attractions on Grand Cayman.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,This is one of the obligatory activities. The area was teeming with other tour boats but we were able to find a spot and drop anchor. Worth doing.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,I have a photo of two of my kids holding a Stingray! I was only brave enough to touch one...it felt like velvet. This was quite an experience.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Loved the crystal blue waters and the experience. Didnt like that there were so many boats there but most of the boats were a good distance away from each other. Petting a stingray is an experience like nothing else.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Frank took us out on one of his boats supplied snorkel gear lifejackets and punch and snacks! Stingray's are beautiful creatures and very gentle my husband loved his back massage!

g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,awsome boat great crew. its once in a life time. use red sails they are great
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Great experience. The company "Captain Marvin's" people were very helpful and friendly. They made it fun and easy. We did the 3 stop package with Stingray City and two other snorkeling stops. I would recommend this group to others.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,The water was just a beautiful blue so clear. the guides were great took time w/us to hold touch or kiss the stingrays!! What an experience. The stingrays that I held touched & actually kissed one were all very gentle.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,A truly heartwarming experience to stroke these large and friendly rays. Years of being respectfully handled and petted by people and of course the odd fishy treat made this an experience that I would even put above swimming with dolphins.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,This is a must do on Grand Cayman. Forget the big tour boats though. Go with a small group on jet skis. I recommend Fat Fish Adventures. Best on the island.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,We make a point to visit Stingray city on every visit to GCM. It is always a great time and a wonderful way to experience these wonderful creatures. Book through Red Sail for the best trip!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,It was awesome to be in the water with the rays!! They really are beautiful
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,This is a really fun place to go. The stingrays are a real "kick"...always ready to come near you in the ocean the minute you arrive! They want food....of course...they are like velvet to touch...just don't step on one. That...they don't like!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,The tri-maran to sting ray city was awesome. Dexter made the trip unforgetable
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Don't go on a mega-cattle boat. Ask the folks at Turtle Nest Inn for their recommendation. Worth doing once wouldn't make a special effort to do it twice.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,We took at timeshare tour at the Reef resort & our trip was free. It was amazingclear blue water lots of soft stingrays the Red Sail catamaran was the way to go and the rum punch was delicious!!! You must do this trip & get it for free.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Everyone has to do it once. It's awesome the first time or two you do it after that ...eh...
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,great Captain - sharing stories finding us the right spot to be with the stingrays and a reef that was full of beautiful fish and coral
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,This is a experience you'll never forget. To go to the crystal clear waters and swim with the stingrays is something just so original and beautiful.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Fabulous activitiy not to be missed. We went with a private boat that made the experience even greater. Only few of us...so many stingrays!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,This is one of the most popular attractions on Grand Cayman for a reason. Petting feeding and watching giant stingrays up close yet being feeling safe is a fascinating and fun experience that would be appropriate for both young and old.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Really cool - probably does not matter who you go with although smaller boats with less cruise ship passengers would be better. Regardless - the experience of swimming with the rays was totally awesome!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Normally I stray away from touristy activities while on vacation however this was highly recommended by friends. I was absolutely an amazing and unforgettable experience.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Loved the sand bar where the stingrays come and feed. It was sensational. My kids loved it. It is so shallow and the water is crystal clear. An absolute must!!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,What an incredible time you will have handling and swimming with the rays in their natural habitat! Only 3ft of water in the middle of the ocean! Kids of all ages will love it! Jimmy Banks from the Red Sail Sport shop at Rum Point is the tour to go on!!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,This is a great way to experience stingrays in a very controlled non threatening environment. For those who dive that haven't been close to a stingray it is worth it. There are tons of them looking to be fed - guaranteed.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Great team very professional they know what they are doing!!! highly recommend!!!! the trip was very smooth interesting and knowledgeable we enjoyed a lot and learned a lot about those amazing creatures.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,A good way to get up close to stingrays but pretty 'artificial'. You sit in a ring and essentially feed them. I prefer to see them in their 'natural habitat' but it was neat to be that close.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,So fun .tons of stingrays just swimming around looking for food that you feed them. Swim with then and give them a big hug
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,The wild stingrays let you hold them kiss them rub on them and love you to feed them squid which most guides provide. There was even a dolphin that was swimming around! Bring your snorkel so you can see them underwater.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,It was amazing to be able to stand up in the middle of the ocean!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Booked through Red Sail at Rum Point. We sailed out under wind. It's an experience all ages will appreciate. So funny to see the reactions everyone has when they see the stingray headed for them.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Fun for all ages and abbility. Safe and sure to change many misconceptions regarding fear of stingrays. Positive interactions with nature are always winners

g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,lots of fun playing with stringrays and two additional sites for snorkelling
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,My husband and I went on a cruise just to get to Stingray City! It was AMAZING!!! We went on an excursion with Kelly's Watersports our guides Daniel and David were awesome!! Beautiful water wonderful people and truly an experience of a lifetime...<3
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,We have visited Stingray City a half dozen times in the last 15 years and have enjoyed it each time. The whole family loves it.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Don't know of anywhere else you can actually touch and hold large stingrays like this in the wild. We went on the catamaran but a smaller more personal trip may have been more fun. It's busy when the weather is nice and cruise ships are in dock so go early!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,My title pretty much says it all. There were tons of boats and people but I felt like I had ample attention from the stingrays. I wouldn't go with Red Sail sports try and find someone else.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Just a nice fun afternoon or morning. Red Sail Co. did a great job and it was pleasant and enjoyable.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,This is the most beautiful expereience! Being in the water with the stingrays is magical; they are so gentel and peaceful to be around. At first it is intimidating but once you are there you don't want to leave.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Fantastic experience and a sound crew. Would go again if we return to the island
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,If we had to pick one "extra" on vacation this would be it. The water was beautiful and the stingrays were amazing.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,The rays were gentle and fun to be around. Loved feeding them while we were there and taking pictures with them.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Strangely fabulous. the rays are like puppiescoming for foodbumping you. they are not dangerousthey are small compared to the 220 pound one that killed irwin. their stingers cant kill you and they dont sting anyway.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Awesome way to get up close and personal with the stingrays. Shallow enough water that even non-swimmers can enjoy. Great photo op and overall a lot of fun. Highly recommend to any one traveling to the island.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,I had seen pictures and knew what to expect but the experience blew me away. It was just amazing. Our whole family (including my 71 year old mother) was squealing with delight. We went with Stingray Sailing and it was an awesome experience!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Talk about trained and domesticated. At two feet of water in the outer edge of the bay we even had the little kids out in the water with the stingray. What a fun experience watching them come to you when you get in the water and feeding them by hand. You don't want to miss doing this !
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Stingray City was so amazing but I was slightly intimidated by the giant rays.They are however sweet and gentle! I can honestly say I would do it again in a heartbeat....hopefully I wouldn't be as scared! We went with Captain Morgan's and our crew was knowledgeable and fun. What a great time!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Don't go on this tour on a windy day - kinda ruined it.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,To say that the experience was unique is an understatement. Our guides from Red Sail Sports described the feeling of the stingrays as a wet portobella mushroom on the bottom and a fine grit sandpaper on top (they were exactly right). This is a must do if you visit Grand Cayman! You won't regret it.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,this is a must go to when in Cayman... stringray's are soft and friendly take a snorkle and mask
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,I've been twice now to Stingray City and I love the up close experiences with the sting rays. The rays have hundreds of people a day come see and interact with them so they are like domesticated dogs. Great 1/2 day adventure for anyone young or old!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Sharing the waters with these wonderful creatures and enjoying each others' company was an incredible experience. So gentle silky and trusting! Unforgettable
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,This experience was different. Some in my group loved being surrounded by these creatures while others were alittle freaked out. The day we went the water was chopper than usual so it was difficult to place your feet on the botton of the ocean floor. Overall all it was a good experience was you get over the fear. lol
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Only saw one stingray. They must have all been out of the "city."
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,This was a really fun and informative excursion.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,We went with Dexter's Fantasea Tours and had a great time with "Goldy" the stingray. Gorgeous scenery lovely sail.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,This was and will always be the best place to see stingray's up close. We held them and was able to feed them. With Dexters' Fantasea Tours a must do with the family!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,I don't dive but I was allowed to snorkel above the divers while they dove Stingray City.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Love the photo op. Shallow sand bar is perfect for families. Thrilling to swim with the sting rays. Don't forget that when you lift them out of the water they "spit."
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Had a fun dive interacting with the rays. I did expect there to be more of them . I Will try it again on an early morning dive maybe they were FULL!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,I was a bit unsure of this trip but it turned out GREAT. Yoi stand in waist-deep water and there are literally dozens of huge stingrays that swim by. You can pet them feed them and have your photo taken with them. The water is warm and clear - bring ypur face mask. It is a really fun adventure..!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Must do....almost didn't but decided to go....went via Catamaran and went to the sandbar....4 feet of water. An experience of a lifetime.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,amazing being surrounded by these smooth graceful creatures. Too crowded unless you're on one of the first boats out. Go as early as possible.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,

g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,If you are going to leave your resort for one reason it has to be Stingray City. I highly recommend using Captain Crosby.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,By going out with a smaller operation the trip was great and they knew the rays and kept it very interesting. This was a great activity and the four of us had a great time!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,We just did Sting Ray City for the 3rd time and it is a blast however they are not letting you feed the sting rays any longer only the crew can feed them. But still a great time a must see on a vist to the Caymans
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,We took a catamaran (which I booked at the resort for free in return for seeing their timeshare presentation) from Rum Point out to sting ray city stopping at a reef along the way to do some snorkeling. It was a lovely day...free rum punch and beautiful scenery!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,we were on a cruise but made the arrangements locally for the stingray city tour. The trip was awesome.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Awesome Experince. A Must Do! Best thing I did the whole trip!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Go with Dexter's Tour and get small group attention.

g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,This trip is worth it. The catamaran is not crowded unlike many boats we saw at Stingray City and Mario the tour guide was very pleasant to be with. We were offered soft drinks and pizza after our snorkel. It was like being on your own private yacht with friends. Would definitely recommend this tour with them.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Went there several years ago. My wife and I both were able to pick up a stingray. I also fed one. We took our kids specifically back on a cruise to visit but due to weather were redirected to Jamaica and so missed out.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Stingrays swimming all around you as you feed them. Stingrays are amazingly smooth.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Took our family 3 adults and two girls 7 and 8 - what an experience. Safe fun and amazing. Took Red Sail Sports out of Rum Point on a catamaran - would do the jet skis if our kids were older. Sail over was fun too.

g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,We cruised with Captain Marv to the sand bar and kissed the stingrays. Amazing creatures. We then stopped to snorkel in two different locations. Try to go when there are not a lot of cruise ships in port so it will be less crowded. A must do trip!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,This was absolutely a crazy excursion!! The stingrays come in and are everywhere!!!! We got to touch one ... And then I even got to hold one. Our tour guides were absolutely the best..no question went unanswered ... Marine land tours was the best!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,I've taken people here several times. It's really something you should try once. I've "been there done that" ... but the Rays are really cool.

g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,I had a terrific time visiting stingray city but I would recommend a charter (like Cayman Private Charters - great staff!). Reason being is that this small area quickly gets overwhelmed by the mobs of tourists offloading by the hundreds from the cruiseships. Get a charter so you can get there early and really enjoy yourself.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,We went out to the sandbar known as 'Stingray City' with Captain Marvins and had a blast! The stingrays are so docile and friendly - you stand in 3 to 4 feet of water and they actually swim right up and brush against you. This is a must do when visiting Grand Cayman island.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Take a tour rent a boat a jet-ski go with a friend with a boat... Whatever. One of the greatest natural attractions in the world. Something you will never forget.

g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Sailed out to the sandbar on a Red Sail catamaran for the evening trip. Only about 20 on board and no other boats out at the site. Try to go on a day when there are no cruise ships in or take this late sail time when things are quieter. Very amazing experience don't miss it!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Went 13 years ago and my daughter was scared when she was 3. She always wanted to go back and touch them.. Captain Marvins made the whole experience pleasurable. The whole family got to touch them and stand on the sand bar. You can swim with dolphins in a lot of countries but swimming with stingrays only happen in Cayman!!!!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Although a bit terrifying I would not miss it for the world! Forget Steve Irwin ... our Marine Biologist explained the whole thing no worries! (Not George Kastanza another one..) Try to time it when the cruise ship excursions are not there... the sandbar has a max. capacity of 2000 people ... sharing interactions with about 75 rays!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Sting rays galore! We had so much fun playing with the stingrays! They put on a great show for us. Always thought I would enjoy dolphins more but now I'm not sure! Highlight of my trip!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Did a visit to Stingray city in conjunction with the Dolphin Swim experience. Such a great time. This pictures were pricey but were worthwhile memories. Anchored up in Stingray City a sandbar about 2-3 feet deep.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,This was so incredible! to see these magnificent creatures swim right up to you and gently nudge you is breathtaking! they are so gentle and we got to feed them...they were so funny! they knew when the food was available! I would do this all over again if I ever get the chance!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,This experience was fantastic!! We held the stingrays kissed the stingrays & fed squid to the stingrays!! This is a great month to do this activity because the crowds are small!!!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Try and go on the days cruise ships are not in port. Absolutely a must very shallow water and the stingrays are incredibly friendly. Do not miss!!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,This place is full of the most beautiful and the best stingrays. This animals are really harmless and they let you play with them. Recommend it for everyone. We went by jetskis with Action Watersports.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,The tour was awesome. Waist high water on a sandbar. The guides help you to hold the stingrays if you want. Don't be chicken---they will even help you give them a smooch. Delightful time
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,This is the only place I know where you can feed the Rays. Domesticated sting rays come as soon as they hear the boat motor. You can also get there by jet ski but best way is to don some scuba gear touch and feel them. Great experience
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Wonderful experience we had during our stay at the island. All the boats arrive to the same spot - just pick one. We enjoyed a lot in this unique experience
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,really an amazing experience a must-do tour in Cayman Island. Have seen over a dozen of stingray in the sea at the same time. They seem to enjoy swimming with human being.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,What an amazing experience! The water is so clear and the stingrays so friendly. A bucket list must!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,We had a fantastic afternoon snorkelling with the stingrays. There are lots of companies that will take you out to the sand bars - make sure you get one that gets there before all the cruise ship tours arrive. Don't be afraid of them - they are very friendly!!! Take some time to snorkel as well.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Semi-tame stingrays swimming all around you allowing you to get up real close and personal. Then a chance to feed them pieces of squid and have photos taken. All this on a sand bar far offshore in waist deep crystal clear water. What could be better than that? Go and experience the sensation yourself!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,We visited Sting Ray City via Jet skis with Fat Fish Adventures. It was a great experience. Skip the boat tours - take a jet ski. They are smaller groups more intimate setting great guide and a lot of fun.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,I went in a trip to see stingray city as a last minute decision.. Was totally worthwhile. Between they stingrays which were friendly and interactive and the catamaran ride plus snorkeling- it was a great day!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Absolutely amazing experience standing on a sandbank waist deep in water miles away from the land with Stingrays swimming around you is fantastic. Make sure you take an underwater camera!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Take the early am trip! It's so great to be out there almost alone with the sting rays. After it gets super busy and crowded. It's cold but so worth it
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,This is my 3rd time doing this excurision and I never get tired of doing it. I love bringing new people to experience this awesome adventure. Very safe. For extra excitement try rubbing a piece of squid on your loved one's bum and watch the stingrays try to climb all over them. LOL
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Right in their with hundreds of sting rays. Tour boat operators bring pieces of squid so you can feed the stingrays. They rub up against you like cats. Plenty tame and you can even hold them. Must see if your in the cayman islands.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Another out of this world experience swimming with all those stingrays was worth the trip. We got to feed and hold them. Throughly enjoyed it the water was crystal clear and warm. Highly recommend! !!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,So much fun!!! Went to Stingray City Starfish Point and Secret Garden. Not a lot of starfish but enough to get the experience. Stingray City was awesome!! Got our picture taken holding one and kissing it. Definitely a must-do!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Absolutely the best excursion my wife and I have done.... The water is amazing and the guides make sure of your safety as well as the safety of the stingrays. Will do again my next trip to the Caymans
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Beautiful shallow crystal clear water to visit with the stingrays. Many great photos to be taken here. The secret is to go when there are no cruise ships in port. Plan ahead so you can enjoy the day to it's fullest. A must see/do when in Grand Cayman.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,This is a must do in Grand Cayman! It is truly an awesome experience to get that close to large stingrays. Also tons of conch shells to look at as well.
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Absolutely loved everything about stingray city. We booked our excursion with Aquarius tours who also brought us snorkeling and to starfish point. I would highly recommend visiting stingray city!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,Though highly conditioned by the daily armada of tourist boats attending the place this is without a doubt one of the best tours to take. A must do for those visiting Grand Cayman. We did the tour with a 259 and 11 year old: no problem at all!
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 28 2016,The sting rays come right up to you in shallow water and you can feed them. They are very soft to pet. The guides explain a lot about them and it's a really fun time.
g147365,d2198364,February 26 2016,fun experience for the entire family....you to old! most visitors are friendly and friendly. over crowded at times. Plan a trip with a reputable tour company.
g147365,d2198364,February 26 2016,Really cool to have the stingrays swim around you. Most amazing water I have ever seen/been in. Guide was informative and was cool to hold/kiss the stingray. Only negative is lots of people and interaction very short as you're waiting for other people in your huge group to have a turn.
g147365,d2198364,February 26 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 26 2016,Great day with a boat tour placed us on a sand bar where all but the smallest children can stand. The sting ray are soft friendly and constantly coming back for more contact. The guide said they felt like portobello mushrooms... They did. We held them the kids kissed them and it was just great!
g147365,d2198364,February 26 2016,Tour guides were great. The water was perfect on temperature and clarity. The sting rays were in the area and our guides were able to catch one and show us the ray. They are amazing animals. Changed our opinion of the animal.
g147365,d2198364,February 25 2016,Wonderful experience interacting and feeding the sting rays! The crew was awesome as well! Must visit!!! They took time telling about the sting rays and even found a starfish for us to look at.
g147365,d2198364,February 25 2016,We had been other places to swim with the stingrays they were fenced in so to speak and were a captive audience but here they were wild and free. It was amazing to see them arrive and swim past come up to you and investigate you as you did them. Worth the money.

g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,No matter whether it's sunny or not a trip to Stingray City is always memorable and you are sure to have a good time. don't forget your snorkel gear. the nearby reef is a awesome sight with many colorful fish and sea creatures.
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,Loved this tour. Easy! Anyone can do it as the water is only a few feet deep on the sandbar. Guides were knowledgable and friendly!
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,not a lot to do but you do get to touch the sting rays. Pictures are expensive so try to take your own.
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,Fun Fun Fun. Many Stingray come in to be fed. They do drive bys on you. Highly recommend this activity.
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,Great snorkel trip! Capt Glen was awesome. Stingray sandbar coral gardens and the reef were great. Feeding the rays and swimming with them was fantastic!
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,We were blown away by the experience of this place. it was like a wonderland in the sea. A friend told me about it but nothing he said could have prepared me for this. It was truly wondrous.
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,A must see while visiting the Caymans. Take a boat out to warm clear waters and watch the stingrays swarm to visit. Waist high waters where you can pet and feed these beautiful animals. Snorkeling will amaze you with some of the most beautiful fish I've ever seen.
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,This was the highlight of my vacation. I loved swimming with the stingrays. They were so friendly. We booked through our cruise ship and had a great experience. It was so much fun that I will definitely do it again.
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,Loved getting up close and feeding the stingrays-Stingray City is a must if visiting the Caymans! We even saw a pregnant stingray. It's amazing how shallow the water is in the middle of the sea.
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,

g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,awsome! unbelievable! well worth it! a must do while in the Cayman Islands. you are actually out in the ocean swimming with the sting rays!
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,Once in a lifetime experience the boat ride to the sandbar was fun. Our host was so kind and generous we enjoyed hearing about him and his family. It was a little strange at first being around all these creatures but they are gentle and it was fun to be able to feed them and take a picture holding one.
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,Ben coming here for years and ever year we vist sting ray city. Kids love it and it is a must see! Fun and only place in the world to visit such am exciting place
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,Water is so clear and shallow. A must see when visiting Grand Cayman. Need to take a boat/ferry to get to the stingray city. Stingrays will start coming soon as they hear the boat. Awesome experience.. I am glad we did this tour.
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,Beautiful place the sandbar is so shallow you can stand with water only to your waist. The stingrays come to you for food (but don't let them fool you they are wild animals after all) and you can even hold them/touch them with the help of the locals. A must visit in Grand Cayman!
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,I was a little apprehensive about this at first but it turned out to be a great experience for a relatively low price! I highly recommend going via Captain Marvin's across from the Westin Hotel: the staff are hilarious and the price was right.
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,A must do when visiting whether you go on an organised trip or with friends. The stingrays come to the sound of the boats as they know they are going to be fed. The experience of silky soft rays gliding over and around you is wonderful.
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,Great adventure out on a catamaran the staff amazing. We head out to Stingray Bay and swim with them. Then we head over to a reef to snorkel so amazing. A must do if visiting the island. AMAZING!
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,Very cool time and fun experience. Didn't go with a tour group just friends which is how I would recommend it a small group. Definitely came away with a battle scar though. What's up with that?!
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,We came in off a cruise for 1 day. Stingray City was on our top list. It was so worth the it!! Amazing how sweet and loving the sting rays are. I would recommend!!
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,This was a great shore excursion. Very informative and lots of stingrays to pet. Crew was Great! Would definitely do this again!!!!
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,My husband and I visited the Stingrays on Captain Marvin's 2-Stop Tour. It was such an amazing experience and the view was just breathtaking. Definitely a Must-See!
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,You may wish to bring snacks as none is offered. The crew of the Allure is AMAZING! You get so much time with the stingrays too. The crew handle the stingrays very gently too. I WILL do this again. I loved every second of it.
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,What a totally fantastic amazing trip I can not recommend this trip enough!! It's just a must do why come to Cayman and not do it!!
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,You are in the middle of the ocean in very shallow crystal clear water with sting rays all around. It was beautiful. I wish we were able to spend more time.
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,This is a MUST DO when you're visiting the Cayman Islands. These amazing animals will WOW YOU the minute you approach the sandbar. They are so gentle and are so fun when they glide by you. This was an experience my family & I will never forget.
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,This is a must do while at Grand Cayman. The water is chest high the stingrays come right up to you and you are able to hold them. Don't miss out and also use MarineLand Tours.
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,This was an unbelievable experience. The stingray were so beautiful. If you travel all the way to Grand Cayman you should do this. The Stingray know what is up. They are trained and act accordingly. I had a fabulous day and I went alone because my BF at the time did not want to go.
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,

g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,Absolutely loved Sting Ray City! Definitely would go again!! Holding and touching the stingrays and having so many of them swimming inches away was amazing! We did our tour with Beauty III and the crew went above and beyond to make sure we had the best experience possible!
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,Most beautiful water I have ever seen and the sting rays were so scary at first but ended up being gentle giants.
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,Been too many times to count in the last 25 years Still love it. Been on private boats snorkeling boats dive boats. Awesome experience
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,This is a fun spot unless you're there with tourists from the cruise ships which can make it very crowded.
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,We had a fantastic day at Stingray City. Although we had a large group everyone had an opportunity to touch the stingray. The guides brought them around to all of us and let the adults and older kids hold them. Wonderful experience.
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,

g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,We arrived at Stingray City by boat on a quiet afternoon - what an experience! I was curious but never comfortable - but I was the only one who feared these creatures in their natural habitat. Would I do it again absolutely.
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,Well worth it! Scary at first but I felt totally safe! We used Dexter's Fantasea's. So economical considering the length and quality of the excursion.
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,We rode a bus to the port where we transferred to a boat that will take us to the area where the stingrays are located. My husband and I had a fantastic Stingray encounter ! We were able to touch and kiss the stingray.
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,My girlfriend and I took Paradise Sail co. out of Cumana Bay. Our captain Hotshot had us covered up in these beautiful and sociable animals. Defiantly something you HAVE to do while in Grand Cayman.
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,it is the most popular attraction in the cayman islands  these sting rays are friendly and beautiful  the sea is exceptional . a unique experience for young and olders
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,The stingrays are huge! But i highly recommend conquering any fears and going for it....it is a very cool experience and the guides from the Red Sail group were very helpful and made us feel safe.
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,This was an experience I will never forget! Go on a Sunday when there aren't as many people there if you can.
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,I have been coming to Caymans three times a year for five years. I never get tired of stingray city. I often take guests there. So much fun touching a stingray. Also you get two extra snorkeling experiences
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,We visited Stingray City via Discount Excursions and had an awesome time. We were traveling with a toddler and a 6 year old and did not have any problems. The water at the sandbar ranged from 2 to 4 feet and was crystal clear.
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,A must do activity on Grand Cayman! We used Red Sail and our visit was made great by crew member Tammy - she really interacted with the kids and made the trip wonderful for them. The stingrays are amazing and a little unnerving at the same time - but all in all a great experience.
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,We had a great time here with the red sail crew. Enjoyed the trip and experienced the wonderful stingrays
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,Nice but there was a weird fish it bit us. It was awesome any way. We went twice both nice days awesome
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,A cloud of black coming towards the boat you get in and they are the most graceful gentle friendly creatures. My daughters were amazed and did not want to leave. You will seriously regret it if you don't visit this wonderful place.
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,Going to Stingray City is a MUST if you are visiting Grand Cayman. The tour we went on was excellent (The captains name was Skip) the sting rays all immediately swam to our boat when they recognized it. Lots of time spent in the water with the Rays. Made for an unforgettable experience.
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,It was nice to see you on the stingrays but there was entirely too many people on one boat for me and my family something like 50 people on a catamaran
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,

g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,We went the last day to Sting Ray City by boat with Franks water sports. The Boat broke down on way which was scary but after he got us towed back in his cousin that has a charter took us all to Sting Ray City. It was so fun and so pretty. Would do again ea trip !!!!!
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,We did a tour and snorkeled at two spots and then swam with the stingrays and ended at starfish point. Spectacular day. Really unusual experience.
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,We have been on this trip at least 5 times! It never gets old! The beautiful waters and the Stingray's are so friendly. AMAZING! Would do it again!
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,We absolutely loved this. Completely topped snorkeling in the ocean and Atlantis. The rays were amazing. Everyone was nervous at first but by the end no one wanted to leave them! They are absolutely stunning creatures. We will definitely be back!
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,You must not miss this adventure. Go with a small operator like Captain Marvin's. Take a whole day trip for the best value and fun!!
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,We had a group of 12 family members and this was the favorite part for most of the group. Not too crowded if you go during non-cruise days.
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,A must. Stingrays flock to you like puppies. A great easy dive for any skill level. Depth is around 10-12 feet. Lots of stingrays when we went and stayed with us for a while. All sizes of stingrays came to us. Definitely a must dive while in Grand Cayman.
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,It was for sure my favorite activity in Grand Cayman the sea is so beautiful and u can see a lot of stingrays they come to see u and u can take amazing pictures!
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,The water is beautiful and full of Stingrays. They say if you kiss their nose and you have seven years of good luck. I made sure I kissed a few. It was one of the best things I ever did! Will definitely do it again.
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 24 2016,This is a tourist attraction that everyone who visits the Cayman Islands should take. I have taken all of my guests to stingray city and they all love it. The stingrays are docile and will eat out of your hand a real treat to both the tourist and the ray
g147365,d2198364,February 23 2016,We loved this experience very unique to be with nature in a beautiful environment. Ensure to book with time and ask the company for the best day to go based on weather so that you can enjoy when it's calm (too much wind causes water to be turbulent and limits visibility when snorkeling). Don't miss it!
g147365,d2198364,February 23 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 23 2016,It's a once in a lifetime experience. Beware however it's a bit overwhelming for small children. The stingrays are quite large and several of the children were scared and had to stay on the boat.
g147365,d2198364,February 23 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 23 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,Truly and unforgettable experience! Our guide knew the Rays by name! He found his favourites and brought them over for pictures with us and we all got to feed them squid too! After we went a little further off and enjoyed a bit of snorkeling too :)
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,I still not believe thart I kissed a sting ray. They are so soft and kind. They are giants and pass to us so delicated. I recomend that all family goes there and watch this experience. The sting grays are so kind and delicated. I not recomend the dolphinarim. It sad that animals have to worj8j8
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,the water is about waist deep and the stingrays will just pass you by . they are human friendly. Guide will explain much about them. great picture taking too. only drawback is you can expect big crowd. I counted at least 10 boats in this small sandbar - easily 500 people. but i would definitely go again.
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,What an amazing experience ..... our boat captain and mate were in the water with us and really made this a memorable experience by showing everyone how to hold the stingrays .....
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,From the pick-up at the port to the boat ride to the sting ray sand bar and the sting ray experience were the most fun we had on our trip! The entire staff is friendly and knowledgeable. They keep you safe and let you have fun while you're out with them in the water with the rays.
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,Great experience for travelers of all ages. Awesome experience swimming with and feeding the sting rays. Highly recommended when visiting the island.
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,This was an amazing trip! A lovely boat trip to the stingray sandbar gorgeous warm water and lots of friendly stingrays. Definitely worth the money although it can be quite crowded when lots of tours arrive at once!
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,Stingray City is a truly unique place- a sandbar where hundreds of rays congregate and swim right up to you! Not a contrived captive experience-- something not to be missed!
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,I love watching rays so a trip to stingray city is a must do in my book. Besides watching them you can feed them!
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,Wonderful experience! I was intimidated at first but the StingRays are very gentle. By the end of your time there you will not want to leave them. They say if you kiss one it's 7 years good luck. So go for it (although your lips taste really salty afterwards)
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,Great experience! We went on a Capt Marvin boat with a great crew! They took us to snorkel on a reef just a little farther from the main group after playing with the stingrays and there was a great variety of fish. Even saw "Frisbee" - they call him that because he had no tail.
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,Sting Ray city was so much fun. We went via a huge catamaran. Got to feed the sting rays which was very interesting and then head to a little private island for drinks and relaxing. It also became a great spot for impromptu photoshoots.
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,go first thing in the morning so you miss the crowds from the cruise ships. an experience not to be missed
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,Took my kids (6 and 4) out to Stingray City on Red Sail tours out of Rum Point. It was amazing. My kids absolutely loved it!
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,Just in the middle of the ocean you can stop to touch and kiss stingrays. Tamed beautiful creatures swimming right next to people. Many companies offer the tour to this attraction and it is worth visiting.
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,Went on tour out to stingray city. Boat driver explained how this place came to be. It's fun. It's a little scary at first but when you see how relaxed the rays are The more you relax It's definitely a must.
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,An incredible tour to swim amongst stingrays in the ocean hold them kiss them in the wild is unheard of and this is in the open ocean - not like Sea World.
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,This was fantastic! I'm not an ocean person but I definately enjoyed this excursion. I was talked into doing this at last minute and enjoyed every minute of it. You get to hold the Stingrays and play with them. We used Red Sail for our excursion and they were very professional and educating. A MUST DO!
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,Think is still better to do as a dive then just snorkel if you can. Really an amazing site. Not crowded which was a pleasant surprise.
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,A super family fun activity. If your not a diver you can enjoy the site with a snorkel adventure. The water was warm and crystal clear. Marie our guide leader was fantastic. Being up close and touching the stingray's for an hour was spectacular. I would recommend this activity for any age.
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,Had always heard great things about Stingray City but the rumors didn't come close to how awesome the experience was. Actually went twice once with Captain Martin's and once on jet skis with Fat Fish. Highly recommended both groups. Lots of stingrays in the water easy to navigate water just deep enough to get great photos of the rays.
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,was concerned that this could be just a tourist trap. We are certified divers but I found this to be an amazing experience
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,It wasn't quite as magical as I was told but it was a lot of fun! The waves were a bit rough and there weren't as many sting rays as what is usual but still it was something amazing and we've never done anything like this!
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,These trips are unique safe and fun! We have been there many times and always enjoy! This trip was with Red Sail on the glass bottom boat. We have also done the big cat. Either way a great time!
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,We went there on a private charter with another family we met in Cayman. I was uncomfortable at first....all I could think of was Steve Irwin!! But became acclimated and it was so amazing. They are like lovable puppies they want to snuggle and be loved on. Quite an experience.....our family loved it!
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,We booked the deluxe stingray city through carnival and had an amazing time.the guides were great and the experience was great would definitely recommend this.
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,Fun to see from a boat and get in the water and swim with the stingrays. The sandbar in the middle of the ocean is quite a surprise! Everyone who visits Grand Cayman whether on cruise or land stay should visit Stingray City.
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,While this place does get a little crowded it's easy to see why. Docile stingrays (water dogs?) rubbing against your legs in the shallow water taking food out of your hands is an amazing experience. We were smiling and laughing at their antics the entire trip.
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,This is one of the most touristy things to do in Grand Cayman but is a MUST do. Amazing experience. Go with a fun crew and you wont be disappointed.
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,This was by far the most exciting part of the trip to Cayman. A must do when visiting Grand Cayman. Definitely check the cruise ship schedules and book your excursion accordingly.
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,I love this place and visit it everytime I'm in Grand Cayman. Holding a stingray is a magical experice.
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,This was one of the best experiences we have had! The stingray were so friendly like little puppies. We look forward to coming back & bringing kids.
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,A truly once in a lifetime experience. The stingrays are friendly and the sandbar is shallow enough for everyone from young to old to be able to enjoy.
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,Our group of 4 hired Nick's Private Charters for a half day and the first stop was Stingray City. These amazing creatures all domesticated like dogs love your attention and especially squid! Don't be scared to touch hug and kiss them!
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,One cannot visit the Cayman Islands and not go to Stingray City. You may have swam with stingrays in the past but never in there natural habitat. The sandbar experience is amazing! Please don't forget your Go Pro as you will definitely want pictures and video of your experience.
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,It was a lot of fun to feed and hold the Sting Rays. I highly recommend doing this at 7am before everyone else though. White Sands on the East is the only company that offers a 7am trip I believe.
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,A MUST See in Cayman! Our family was timid at first but warmed quickly warmed up to the experience!
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,Definately worth the experience if you are not squeamish! The first time I tried to do this I could take the stingrays touch me so I did not stay in the water long. But when I went again with the family we all
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,Got to feed hold and enjoy the stingrays. A once in a lifetime experience. Went with six senses excursions. Donovan allowed us the opportunity to hold a sting ray and educated us about them.
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,Loved this visit. Went by jet ski to Stingray City Rum Point and Starfish Cove. All worthwhile and enjoyable. Best part was almost 3 hours on a jet ski for the same price as 30 minutes hire elsewhere.
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,I have done this now three times. It is aways best to do it on SCUBA. The interactions are so much better. Plus the number of people in the water is far less as well. Diver Down made it so easy!
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,We went to sting ray city with Acquarius Tour group and had a fantastic day! It was amazing to be in the water with the sting rays and be so up close and personal with them! Highlight of the trip for me!!
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,Loved every second of this visit! We snorkeled and held the stingrays. The water was absolutely beautiful and clear. We looked for fish. We had the best time every at this location!
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,Our entire family really enjoyed this experience. We booked the trip through Red Sail Water Sports who were fantastic to work with. It was an amazing experience to have the Sting Rays swimming around you. They are truly gentle creatures and are so beautiful to watch. I would highly recommend it.
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,I went with my 4 year old who had a great time and an experience to remember. Make sure to get life vest before you leave the hotel as the life vests on boat are not always perfect. Also bring goggles for the kids.
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,a lot of fun getting close to menacing-looking yet really gentle creatures. The guides were really informative.
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,Great fun with the puppies of the sea. Catch it in the morning before it gets crowded. We went with White Sands and had a great time and was back at the dock by 9:30-10:00
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,I loved it! The sting rays are amazing. I felt sort of bad holding them but they seemed to be ok with it. It is a very cool experience. If you are not a good swimmer don't worry! The water is shallow and waist deep so you stand the whole time!
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,I was not initially interested in doing this but it turned out to be very fun. We had good weather. Our tour guide(Capt Marvins) did a great job of helping to catch and hold the sting ray; feed them; and simply admire them. It was definitely worth the time to go do this.
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,Everyone on the island does this excursion but it's worth it. The most amazing part to me is as you are standing in the turquoise waters that are only up to your waist or chest level you can look to the dark waters north about 800 yards and be amazed that the water depth is 20000+ feet.
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,Was unique but if you've seen it once that's plenty. Go when there's not cruise ships in. Could be scary for little kids. You may want to let others feed the rays and watch. Rays can be aggressive when trying to be fed.
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,Kissed a sting ray how cool is that. we took a morning excursion to see the most graceful animals in the world. Go there to be the first boat on the sand bar. Was not sure what top expect but was amazed beyond my expectations. If you come to the Cayman Islands don't leave without seen this.
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,We had a great time because we had a great tour guide. The rays are amazing and interesting. If you take your trip with the ambassador dive shop. Located at the comfort inn on 7miles beach.
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,You don't want to miss out on an experience like this. Just keep your feet on the bottom. What a blast ! Everyone loved it and I would go back to do it again anytime I get the chance.
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,the guides at six senses Eco tours made our visit to stingray city absolutely fantastic. Recommend these guys to meet the stingrays. We fever found a pregnant one!!!
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,fun and exciting. Brought my mother on a cruise and did this! Both of us totally enjoyed it. The water was clear and the stingrays were abundant and very friendly.
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,Tour was fast and not worth the money. They was very pushy and rushed all the guests. They took photos and tried pushing them on people. It's a waster of money and our time.
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,

g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,Even though there was a lot of wind there were still plenty of stingrays to go around. They came right up to you looking for food or just checking you out. On a calm day I bet it's even better.
g147365,d2198364,February 22 2016,Rowan Watersports took us to this beautiful blue spot out in the ocean & it was littered with hundreds of stingrays in all sizes!! Captain Clayburn Allison & Dave were all professional courteous & fun!! We took our 20 & 24 yr old children they loved it!! Highlight of our cruise!!
g147365,d2198364,February 21 2016,This was amazing and so much fun!!!!! Would love to do this again if we are ever back on the island. We were able to feed and pet the stingrays. They are quite aggressive when squid is in the water but we were fully prepared and told this before we ever got in the water.
g147365,d2198364,February 21 2016,An amazing and unforgettable experience. Feed and swim among stingrays . An unique experience. A sandbar close to the coast full of singrays
g147365,d2198364,February 21 2016,what a great trip the water was so clear the men on our boat were so helpful my 2 grandsons were able to hold them - kiss them - and get a back massage and the crew took some great pictures.
g147365,d2198364,February 21 2016,Once in a lifetime experience meeting spending time with these rays. Highly recommend Seven Seas tours for your visit.

g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,It's better early in the morning as the day goes on so many people have fed them they aren't really interested. It's really fun when there are a lot of stingrays around. Hopefully the you don't have any idiots in your groups screaming and jumping around.
g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,

g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,My second visit to Sting Ray City - first time was great 2nd time was okay - didn't stay long with tour group. You should definitely go but check with your tour group about all that is involved. Don't be afraid the rays are beautiful creatures.
g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,Outstanding! So glad we made the reservations at the Ritz Carlton.We felt safe in the water and all measures of safety were taken prior to jumping in the water.
g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,The trip to Sting Ray City was breathtaking. We used Captain Marvin's crew services it was amazing and very affordable. Three stops on the way to sting ray city (1) barrier reef (2) and coral gardens (3) were spectacular. I highly recommend it to all travelers to this beautiful island.
g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,

g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,This was something that makes your heart race. Beautiful majestic creatures playing with you in waist deep water. Second trip to this area we love it. YOU HAVE GOT TO TRY IT>
g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,Day we went was 10 foot visibility. 3 females and 2 males wiyh lots of Sargent major fish around. Lobster head and real rough current.
g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,If you do only one activity in the Caymans this should be it! Step into the clear aqua waters and be surrounded by stingrays.This trip is good for all ages; the water is shallow enough for an adult to stand in and the stingrays are harmless.
g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,It was the best experience ever! Swimming with Sting rays was so much fun! I was scared at first but one came up to me with a kiss and a hug! They are like big puppy dogs! Don't miss this wildlife adventure!!
g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,Stingray city is amazing the water is warm crystal clear and shallow enough for people who are not completely comfortable in the water. The stingrays are friendly and you can hold them and feed them with a guide or supervisor present. I would recommend that anyone with some time on the island take some time to visit Stingray City.
g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,

g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,We hired a private boat capt. and it is a quick trip from Rum Point. As you arrive the site is amazing. Unbelievable that you can come in contact with so many of these beautiful creatures in one location. This is a must do activity while in Grand Cayman. Truly incredible experience.
g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,Water there is georgous!!! They bring you out to the sand bar in the middle of the ocean which is really neat. Sting rays are so awesome I even kissed one ;)
g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,This is a once in a lifetime must to go and swim with the Stingrays very impressive and great to experience in their habitat.
g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,We booked the trip with Sun Rays tours. It was an excellent trip only 4 of us were on the boat. There capcity is 16 people. We sailed back around sunset it was very relaxing. We were offered drinks and pizza. Swimming with the sting rays is special. Try to go when the cruise ships are not in town.
g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,

g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,Our family was looking forward to swimming with the sting rays for weeks! And it exceeded our expectations. My 9 and 6 year old children loved feeding petting and holding them. Snorkeling while large and baby sting rays were all around us was thrilling beautiful and a memory we won't soon forget.
g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,What's not to love about swimming with Stingrays. They just want some love and attention (food). To be able to stand in chest deep water with no current on Grand Cayman (at the sandbar) and be sought by natural Sting Rays in the wild is a wonderful experience. P.S. Many had their bars removed...
g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,Perfect place to frolick with the wild sea life. However please remember this is a wild sanctuary and we must stop taking the Rays out of the water for photos. Respect our natural habitat.
g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,Booked a package through the dolphin cove must say the most amazing thing we have done as a family at first my 8 year old was scared but the. Did not want to leave amazing go!go! Well worth the money
g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,The stingrays were beautiful and friendly. They were so soft and great to hold. It was an amazing experience.

g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,Visiting Stingray City is awesome. You get to be win the the water with tons of stingrays and you can feed and hold them. The guides are super nice and you also get a awesome snorkeling experience.
g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,Had done this before with my husband but this time we brought the kids. Doesn't get old! Sting rays tame as puppies in crystal blue water. Gotta love it!
g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,So cool. You have to go meet the local stingrays. Frisbee was so sweet. He was born without a tail so it wasnt so intimidating feeding him
g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,If you have the right guide this place is great!!!! The sting rays are huge and there are plenty of them!!!!
g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,

g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,My wife went twenty years ago and said this is something we have to do. She was right. This was a once in a lifetime experience...so much fun. If your cruise book your trip once off the boat. It is half the cost.

g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,Amazing! The stingrays were cute and very friendly. The tour guides made sure everyone was safe the whole time. You get the pet feed hold and even kiss the rays. All in all a good experience.
g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,One of the neatest things I've ever done....mainly because it's interaction with the stingrays 'in the wild' and in their habitat. They seem to enjoy the contact and are curious/friendly. It's a once in a life time experience! Do it!!!!!

g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,This was the best experience in Grand Cayman. The sting ray swam right up to the boat and ate out of my hand. It is great to experience these wonderful animals in their environment.

g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,Not to be missed. Booked my trip with Discount Tours for my family of ten and they made it spectacular. Everyone had a great. Time playing with the Rays.
g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,Great experience just make sure you go with someone that knows what they are doing. I saw lots of groups that didn't have the same awesome time we had.
g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,5 of us did the Sting Ray City/ Snorkeling excursion while on a cruise. Seeing and interacting with the sting rays is really cool. I would recommend anyone 8 or 9 years or older give it a try.
g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,We are a family of four with two older children and everyone had a great time. This attraction is not to missed!!!
g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,A must if you go to Grand Cayman!! It's a great trip for any age. The boat ride out to the sand bar is smooth and the stingrays are very use to people.

g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,My wife and i went to stingway city in a glass bottom boat tour from rum point. This was one of the highlights of our trip. Just go do it and don't be scared these stingrays are super friendly
g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,must do unique experience short boat ride absolute a must safe for everybody nothing I disliked nothing else to say
g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,Great activity appreciated by all the family! It is safe even for young kids. This place and its history is very interesting. The rays love squid!
g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,This was our most memorable activity as a family. It is well worth the price. The encounters with the huge stingrays are unimaginable. Best pics of our entire vacation were taken here.
g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,This was a very unique experience. You can touch and hold the rays and even give them a little kiss if you like. The water is really clear so bring your underwater camera gear to get some cool shots.
g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,Stingray City was a fabulous experience. I highly recommend Fantasea Tours as they offer smaller charters and more attentiveness.
g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,Use Catain Marvin. Great group that is very attentative details. They made the trip fun as well as safe for all members of our group.
g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,My favorite memory of the trip was my Dad getting into the water with the stingrays. My Dad has a tough time walking sometimes so it was extra special.

g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,This is a must do can't miss Cayman experience!! Especially if you have young children. It's a magical experience for them. It's just an incredible experience for anybody of any age. Get off the island and check out these beautiful creatures in the crystal clear water...
g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,This was so much fun! You're in the middle of the ocean on a sandbar where you can touch. The waves are rolling in and out and the stingrays are everywhere! They are gorgeous and so much fun to watch and hold and kiss! We went with Acquarius Tours and had a wonderful time. Would recommend it to absolutely everyone!
g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,This is a must do when you visit Grand Cayman. Best encounter with sting rays. One tip if the cruise ships are docked don't go until they leave. Gets too crowded at sting ray city.
g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,OMG! This was amazing and fantastic I will never forget this experience. Its scary and thrilling at the same time! Will do this again for sure!
g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,Fun but I felt a bit guilty as the employees handled the Rays so we could kiss them etc. however the Rays come to this area of their own accord so it seems to be a symbiotic relationship. We feed them they let us cuddle!
g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,This is just an amazing experience if you love animals and wildlife. It's a little scary at first to have the stingrays swim up to you but you quickly realize that if you are confident and quiet they are not aggressive at all and pretty soon you'll be petting them like puppies!
g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,A very unique experience. Be prepared for numerous stingrays to surround you. Some were quite large - between 3 - 4 ft at their widest point. If you are hesitant I would recommend staying away from the "bait" they put out and away from the crowd of people until you feel more comfortable. Would definitely recommend.
g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,We booked through Captain Marvins. They took us to two other stops that were breathtaking. The captain and crew were incredible and went out of their way to make sure everyone onboard had a great time
g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,This was an awesome experience. The sting rays are as friendly as dogs! It's a once in a lifetime experience that I would highly recommend. I would go back and do it again in a heartbeat if given the chance. Kiss a sting ray! It's good luck!
g147365,d2198364,February 20 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 19 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 19 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 19 2016,I've been to Bora Bora and the water at Stingray City is comparable. It's absolutely beautiful the water is warm and the rays are friendly. This is a must see when in Grand Cayman!
g147365,d2198364,February 19 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 18 2016,Really good fun. Exciting to see the kids in the water with the animals. Really glad we choose fat fish for the smaller hero more intimate experience.
g147365,d2198364,February 18 2016,We loved Sting Ray City. Our tour was canceled for several days because of wind but luckily we got to go on our last day. Went with six senses they were great. They helped you hold the rays. It is not deep and was fun to see all the rays swimming around. Don't miss this!
g147365,d2198364,February 17 2016,Stingray City was AWESOME! We sailed on The Beauty III. The crew was fun and very knowledgeable. We got to swim with giant stingrays. The crew helped us with pictures. It was the best trip ever. Can't wait to go back!
g147365,d2198364,February 17 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 17 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,A great experience particularly because of our tour operator- Dexter's Fantasea Tours. A bit crowded with boats and people but lots of water and lots of stingrays for everyone there.
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,We love going to Stingray City. We use Captain Marvin Tours each time. It's fun for the whole family. The stingrays are docile and it's a wonderful experience. It is quite touristy but fun regardless. Be aware of the choppy water. I would go on a calm sunshiny day to avoid the crazy water.
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,We had a wonderful trip to Stingray City with Stingray Sailing! Don't go with a large job which will give you minimal interaction with the Rays. We had 10 of us from our boat and we were surrounded by 15-20 rays of all sizes! I was a great experience! The high rating is well deserved!
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,this is one of the craziest things Ive ever seen. Don't get me wrong its amazing. I will admit I was a bit scared at first and certainly didn't kiss the sting ray..but it was overall a cool experience
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,Visited here in 2002 with friends the park is very good and an excellent adventure for kids and families. For divers it might seem a little simple but seeing the stingrays and feeding them by hand is a kick.

g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,Chartered a private boat from Mr. Frank's. Captain Deion and his first mate were First Class Gentlemen and insured my party member had the time of their lives!
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,The pictures might say it all. Gorgeous water. Friendly sting rays. Great tour guides. Such a fun place to be.
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,I've already reviewed it under a different name. This was super cool to see these animals are gentle and friendly! They are soft to the touch and it was an interesting experience getting a back rub by one of them! Ha! Our guide Leon ( Action Watersports) had some squid to feed them with and that helped shatter my fears.
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,We had a wonderful ride out to the sandbar on this particular day it had been raining the day before and it was a cloudy day but the stingrays where amazing but no complaints we went out with the Marine Land Tours the guys are so knowledgable and very friendly to everyone Great job
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,What a cool experience and definitely worth it  the chance to swim with the sting rays and then snorkel in bright blue waters was amazing  defiant a must do in grand cayman

g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,You really do not want to miss this. We went on a small private boat very early in the morning and there was only one other boat besides us. That is the way to do it. I was nervous at first but the sting rays were very gentle. I would actually go again!
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,This place was my favorite part of the trip! The stingrays come rub up against you and around your feet! This place is definetly one to stop at!!!
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,We LOVED holding and petting the sting rays. They are like velvet! They are very gentle creatures and the area is beautiful.
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,I was a little nervous at first - but wow what an adventure! The staff is amazing and so helpful (and calming). Never thought I'd hold a sting ray in my arms - let alone kiss one on the head.
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,Highly recommend 'Cayman Tours' for this. Didn't like that we were placed in such a shallow area of the sandbar (too shallow for me to get any good underwater pics!). Water only up to our knees or just higher. Liked the pics we got CT took many and had us in many poses with the stingrays.
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,Very nice. It was the highlight of our trip. Very up close and personal with the Rays. Nice to see them in a natural environment.

g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,This was an experience that I will never forget. I never thought I would ever be in within 1 inch of a sting ray let alone hold a huge one. We booked our tour by comfort suites and ollie was our guide. Very knowledgeable super cool dude. I would do this again and again.
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,So beautiful and fun!! The guides that we had there were amazing. They helped us hold them take pictures with them and even had the stingrays give us back rubs.

g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,This is the second time I have swum with the stingrays at Sting Ray City and I'll be back for more. Nothing compares to holding a stingray in the wild! If you have a choice Sunday is a good day to go as it is not too crowded.

g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,This is a great trip. The water is so clear and the stingrays are everywhere. You can let them and get your picture taken. I definitely recommend this while in the Caymen Islands!
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,We loved this stop on our tour! It was amazing to get in the water with these beautiful creatures and even more amazing to handle them. Don't even think twice about this- just go!
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,Our very favorite attraction of all. We have been here 6 times and still love it. We have been twice with Captain Marvin (RIP Marvin) and the other 4 times with Red Sail Sports from Rum Point. We love everything about it. You can't go to Grand Cayman and miss this!
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,Our whole family enjoyed this excursion. It was so fun for the kids to feed the stingrays. Remind them to let go of the food though or the rays can get a bit overwhelming! The water is so clear and amazing. The photos were amazing and we blew one up to hang on our wall. Worth it.
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,This was our first time out of the country. We went on the Royal Carribean cruise. We chose this excursion as well as swimming with dolphins. Both of them were breathtaking. We had a wonderful time pictures turned out amazing. Definitely get the pictures well worth the money. The water is unreal and mind blowing.
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,Swimming and feeding the stingrays is a definite must do! Be sure to get 7 years good luck by kissing one :)
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,Awesome is all I have to say! The best ever! I loved the fact that the stingrays were in their natural habitat. No pens fencing or taking out their stingers! I smile so much my cheeks hurt! I was in heaven! A definite MUST do! Worth every penny!
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,This is one thing that everyone should do when they come to Cayman. I mean where else can you feed and swim with the friendly stingrays. I recommend that when you book your tour you book the stingray city/ barrier reef. The reef is beautiful to snorkel.
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,We booked this excursion through Carnival. I believe it was with Allure Travel. We had the BEST girls for our guides on the catamaran. They explained the Sting Ray's really well and made us feel comfortable with them. Super neat experience.
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,I have to say that this was one of the most memorables moments of my life. It's a must go! For me it felt like being with dinossors! I'll never forget that day!
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,Waist deep water. Hundreds of friendly rays. Beautiful sandy bottom. Go with Sun Rays Tours - Lorenzo is the owner and he's the best!
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,This is an experience to have on your bucket list for both the young and young at heart. If you come to Grand Cayman this needs to be on your list of things to do.
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,We loved this excursion! To be able to stand out in the middle of the ocean with stingrays swimming right next to you is a chance of a lifetime!!! Don't hesitate book this excursion now!
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,The stibgray city tour is a MUST DO. it is extremely cheqp qnd you will have a great time if you take it. When you arrive to the city you will see the different color in the water and you will be very shocked by its beauty.
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,This was one of the best experiences we've had. We traveled with a group of 14 most of which were teens. It was hilarious watching them. When they got in the water they were taken by surprise (and a little fear) at the friendliness of the stingrays. After a few minutes they adjusted and enjoyed feeding and petting them.
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,One of the best experiences of my LIFE! These stingrays are not penned up or fenced in like the "swim with the dolphins" offered in many places. It was amazing to stand among the rays as they swim up and interact with you. I would highly recommend this for anyone looking for something a bit different and exciting.
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,Love that the string rays are wild but they are so friendly. An amazing experience! One of my all time favorite things I have done on a trip.
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,We rented Wave Runners which is better because less people and the Stingrays we plentiful. It was more than we imagined it would be this place is a MUST SEE. There is nothing else like it they are wild and in the middle of nowhere.
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,The was so amazing nothing that I thought I would ever do. But I did! The day we went there were a lot of people. I would go either first thing in the morning or later in the day.
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,To be among the sting rays in their natural habitat was an unforgettable experience! Such beautiful and gracious creatures!
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,Gotta expirence these gentle and very social creatures!! It's a "Must Do" on your Cayman Visit! 7 years of Good Luck when they Kiss you!
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,A really fun trip out to see the stingrays.. The you can. Swim with them pet them and take pictures with them. Lots of fun!
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,I went with friends on a boat party and we stopped at Sting Ray City. I fed them some shrimp and it was really amazing - will be doing it again and again whilst I am staying here
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,It is really a great outing. We used Red Sail at Rum Point. Great crew and nice glass bottom boat. It is a must do on Cayman.
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,We have visited Stingray City several times over the years always a fun educational experience for the family we have used Moby Dick Tours for a great visit here and then off for some snorkeling with them.
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,My boyfriend and I went to sting ray city on a tour. The guys who lead the tour were great. They made sure we were comfortable....well that I was comfortable while snorkeling because I can't swim. They stayed close and allowed me to go at my own pace. The sting rays would come right up play.
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,Oh yeah it's awesome!! We went on the breakfast trip to Stingray City with Red Sail. We were the first boat there and that was the best part. As we were leaving all the hordes showed up...still fun I'm sure but I'd recommend either going early or late to avoid the masses especially when the cruise ships are in port.

g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,We visited the stingrays three times it's a wonderful place on the sand bar in the ocean. The stingrays are gentle and love human interaction. It's a definite bucket list tick. Red sail sports who transported us there each time have amazing knowledge and experience and r friendly Professional and caring they also make the experience fun.
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,It looks like no one has a bad time here! Holding a sting ray is an unbelievable experience and I'd borderline call them cute as the bump up against you! Great for all ages and plenty of stingrays to be had by everyone!
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,Nice experience to get close to those wonderful animals. Was a bit upset about how many boats Were there. Too crowded. Loved snorkeling on the reef then.
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,We had an awesome time. Enjoyed learning about and "playing with" the sting rays. Our tour guide and his crew were great.
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,The best trip to Sting Ray City is by jet ski with Fat Fish Adventures lots of boat trips go here but to go out there on jet skis is amazing. You are in the water with the stingrays feeding them....what an amazing experience. You also get to visit star fish cove and snorkel.....10/10
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,By far the most awesome interactive experience ever! I could have stayed all day with these creatures. They are so gentle and it was so much fun getting "kisses" from the sting rays. Can't wait to visit again!
g147365,d2198364,February 16 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 15 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 15 2016,If you get to Grand Cayman you shouldn't miss visiting Stingray City. It's a great experience to be able to touch and interact with stingrays.
g147365,d2198364,February 15 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 15 2016,These sting rays are so friendly! They come up and rub you and lie on your chest. Was truly amazing. And the best part is they are held again their will they choose to come to you. I wish I could again and again!
g147365,d2198364,February 15 2016,We have heard about this exotic trip but when we had the chance to feel the emotion to see touch and kiss the giant stingray fish we definitely can recommend it to any other tourists on the Cayman islands.
g147365,d2198364,February 14 2016,An amazing experience to stroke and 'kiss' the rays but it is spoilt by overcrowding. We had too wait 15 minutes just for the boat to find a space!
g147365,d2198364,February 14 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 13 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 13 2016,We traveled with Red Sail and had a blast. After feeding and dancing with the rays we stopped for a quick snorkel. Saw lots of fish and our guide pointed out some really cool ones including a Green Eel. This is a MUST DO.
g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,Hard to believe wild animals can be so tame. They were soft like cats rubbing against my legs. Holding one was a wonderful experience and they a free to swim off when they want to. We had a great time with Moby Dick Tours.
g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,Me and my besty rented a private yacht in Cayman for just the two of us. Although it was scary at first since its my first time but swimming with them is an experience that I will never forget. Screaming was an option but after a while feeding them made me feel they were my pet already.
g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,This was a great trip all the staff went above and beyond. When we was out with the stingrays they made sure everyone got a chance to interact with them. Thanks for a great trip
g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,Fantastic interaction with the Stingrays. We went out of Rum Point on the Tortuga Diver. Great crew and guides.
g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,The sting rays were so sweet and so friendly - this was a real treat !!! They swim all around your feet and are very willing to allow kisses.
g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,Fantastic seeing feeling and touching these fantastic creatures. We spent just one day in Georgetown arriving by cruise ship and did a private boat trip. The stingrays were the highlight of our whole trip. A must if you are in Grand Cayman.

g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,We went to Stingray City with a crew from Divetech. This was a great adventure. The staff with Divetech was very knowledgeable and did a great job of insuring that everyone got plenty of one on one time with the stingrays.

g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,Getting into the water with stingrays and getting to hold touch and even kiss one was an experience I'll never forget. We went on an excursion from Carnival Cruise lines and I'd do it again!!
g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,Fabulous to be able to swim amongst and feed such a graceful creature. Well organised trip and stunning location
g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,One-of-a-kind way to experience wild stingrays up close and personal. Feed pet hold and even kiss them! Treat them with respect and you won't get stung. I recommend Dexter's Fantasea- only $35 USD for a 3.5-4 hour cruise that also includes snorkeling. This is a must-see on a Cayman Islands visit. You won't find it anywhere else.
g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,Worth the extra money to go with Red Sail Sports on their breakfast catamaran. Professional (and handsome ;)) staff that know how to handle the area and avoid crowds.
g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,We had a great day first swimming among the stingrays petting them holding them...then we continued to Rum Point for a nice lunch and snorkeling experience. Great fun! I highly recommend it!
g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,A little intimidating but a really fun adventure. Highly recommend. Very glad we went! Excursion also included snorkeling and a stop at starfish cove. Just beautiful. Worth every penny!

g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,This was a fantastic trip and what an experience holding the sting rays we went late afternoon with no cruise ships docked so we were very lucky that it wasn't crowded!! Its a must if you go to Grand Cayman!!
g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,Unique interaction with these amazing sea creatures. Recommend booking a smaller boat tour for a more private experience.

g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,I did the Red Sail Sports snorkel trip last year and while the sting rays are beautiful the site was very crowded. I did the RSP dive trip this year - 6 divers on board - wonderful experience.

g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,We took a trip to Sting Ray City with Red Sail that had a sunset "booze cruise" on the way back. It was a great trip and we would highly recommend the experience to everyone. The Red Sail staff was very knowledgeable friendly and accommodating. We had an absolute blast.
g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,This was by far my favorite excursion of any I've ever taken off of a cruise. The water is beautiful and the stingrays are beautiful. We also went snorkeling which was fun. I recommend this if you've never done it before. It's an experience! Also make sure you feed a stingray and hold one!
g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,Of all the places to see when visiting Grand Cayman you must add Stingray City right at the top of your list. A wonderful experience! Also went fishing catching some amazing large fish.
g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,Worth every penny I loved it and the people were amazing only down side the pics they take are kinda expensive and they only email them to you
g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,We LOVED every minute of it. The only thing we didn't like was that we had to leave. The stingrays are amazing & we got to interact with them so much. It was a bit freaky the first time one swam past our legs & sort of brushed against us but again it was great
g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,This was my second time doing this excursion while cruising. This time was just as good as the first you have got to do this at least once. The crew was absolutely wonderful!!
g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,The crew are great the boat ride was very comfortable restrooms and drinks. Thanks for the memories.
g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,We took this excursion in Grand Caymen during our cruise on the Disney Magic. Excellent day on the water - swimming with Stingrays snorkeling and starfish beach. Our captain and guide was excellent great equipment and the boat was not crowded. Would recommend highly
g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,Gotta do it at least once. Really cool and fun experience. The stingrays are amazing. We used Captain Marvin and was very please. Very professional outfit.
g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,I know that's what the brochures say but it really is. Such a unique experience - delightful. The guides are gentle and gracious - enough so that everyone got a chance to experience these magnificent creatures - either feeding them or holding them. So very cool.
g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,We were in the water with 50+ stingrays swimming all around us. Our guide fed them so they gathered and enjoyed swimming around us being touched and fed. We had the chance to pet and hold a few. I was a bit freaked out by them but quickly overcame my fears and actually held one named freckles.
g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,I could not believe how big they were. Such a fun day out there and our tour guide were great! If in the area this is a must do!!
g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,Great place to visit stingrays..............I can't swim but the captain lifted me over to the reef and was convinced I could do it. I am glad I did. Highly recommended.
g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,Standing waist-deep in turquoise water (Caribbean sea!) with stingrays gently brushing past was amazing. MarineLand Tours provided instructions and snorkelling gear so that my family and I could get a better close-up view of these impressive creatures. Never experienced anything like it and it was the highlight of my week-long trip to the Caribbean.

g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,Highlight of our trip! I think it's much better than swimming with dolphins but that's all relative. Definitely worth the $90 for a 3-hr itinerary. Feeding the stingrays were a treat! You need to do this if you go to GCM!

g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,This place is so amazing! The water is shallow and the rays come right to you. They are very docile. Talk about getting in touch with nature! Holding a sting ray should be on the top of your To Do List if visiting Grand Cayman!

g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,As others have said before. Your visit to the grand caymans is not complete without a visit to the stingray city. Make sure you go as early as possible to avoid the crowds!

g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,Cool experience but after 10 minutes you get bored. How long can you really mess with stingrays before you find yourself just wading out in the water hoping something exciting will happen or for the boat captain to call you back so you can leave.
g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,This was AMAZING!!! One of the best things I have done in my life!!! Yes it can be crowded but if you go with the right your they will take you when it is not. We went on the 6 senses tour and we had the whole sandbar to our selfs!!! Perfect experience and a must do!!!
g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,My family of 5 took Captain Marvin's tour to Stingray city. Several us had some fear of these giant creatures but they were incredibly gentle and seemed to really enjoy the human attention. We fed and had pictures taken with the stingrays. Truly a unique experience.
g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,The string rays are so sweet you can tough them and even feed them!!! Definitely worth the trip...:)
g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,Went to Sting Ray City on the 11th of April and had a wonderful time. The guides were awesome and the sting rays were on point. Visited Tiki Beach after the sting rays and enjoyed the beautiful beach and the water.
g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,The stringrays are so friendly and dont have any issues with you petting them or holding them. This was an unforgettable experience. We used Nicks private charters and they were awesome and picked us up from the dock of our rental.
g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,Pros: You will see stingrays. The water is shallow enough that you can stand. Cons: Crowded! There were a half-dozen boats anchored there each with maybe 20 people aboard forming a circle perhaps 50 yards across. Time on site is very limited. Divers will see rays elsewhere without the crowds.
g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,Went with Red Sail Sports whom we highly recommend. They rescued a snorkeler from another ship that left them behind! Bar on board and happy helpful crew. The sting ray meet& greet is one of a kind!
g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,The earlier you go the better....fantastic tour at 7 a.m. No one is around except your group. Perfect!!!!
g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,We took our grand kids on a catamaran tour and when we got to the area to swim with the stingrays my granddaughter was only in the water a couple of minutes and holding a stingray.
g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,It is better than the artificial Sea World and Aquarium ever. I can feel the stingrays swimming happily and freely. It is always better for us to visit them naturally than put them in small swimming pool.
g147365,d2198364,February 12 2016,Great experience that takes you from being frightened to becoming friends with the Sting Rays and the environment. Great fun for everyone. Breathtaking!

A wonderful sandbar with plenty of stingrays waiting to be held and caressed. Many tours will take you but give first choice to Moby Dick Tours. You will not be displeased.

g147365,d2198364,February 9 2016,Best experience during the entire holiday! Stingray City is a sandbank where encounters with lovely stingrays tame as a dove are possible. You can feed pet and yes even kiss them! Unique and incredible experience I would highly recommend to everyone holidaying on Grand Cayman!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,An excellent trip informative and really enjoyable being up close and personal with the stingrays. we went with Aquarius and they were excellent in their knowledge and customer care. Highly recommended

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Stopped here with a snorkel tour and it was pretty cool. The sting rays are everywhere and my girls were kind of afraid. The place was rather crowded both worth a visit nonetheless . Most tour guides will teach you hold and even give your sting ray a kiss!

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,I have been here twice with my family and I have loved it. I would go back again if I had the chance. The stingrays are very kind. I have never been in a dangerous situation with them nor can I imagine one despite all the people.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Great Fun - An up close and personal experience with the stingrays - keep your thumb tucked into your fist when feeding them!

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Very cool experience to be out in the ocean on a sand bar interacting with aquatic life. If you want the best experience skip the big boats from Red Sail and take a small tour where you will maximize your time understanding fun and experience. Check out Six Sense Eco Tour to do it right!! Teens LOVED it.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We visited Stingray City with Moby Dick Tours and had a fantastic time! I was skeptical but found the stingrays to be very docile and friendly. We also snorkeled the nearby barrier reef and thoroughly enjoyed the abundant marine life. I definitely recommend this during your visit to Grand Cayman.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,There were tons of boats and people in a circle area where the friendly sting rays are. You have to hire a guide/boat to take you out there. It's about 35 mins from shore. We did Franks Watersports highly recommend them. Everyone is taking pictures and it's crowded but we loved holding and petting the stingrays!

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Getting to cuddle with the sting rays was beyond wonderful. Our trip through Moby Dick's charter service was great. They provided about 45 minutes with the rays and 45 minutes of snorkeling. The snorkeling while perhaps not as amazing as the encounter with the rays should not be minimized. The abundant sea life was fantastic.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Greta boat ride out there as it is 40 minutes to the location. There are tons of boats and tourist there along with 100's of stingrays. One big warning is he stingrays get aggressive when it is feeding time and freaked my daughter out.

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Getting this close to big marine animals is an amazing experience although a little daunting at first. Recommended.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,great experience  lots of stingrays on the surface and in the sand in the water  but also lots and lots of people  may be better to limit the number of people per visit
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We had fun and saw many stingrays swim with us. You really need to stick with your group on stingray city as there are so many people and boats easy to get mixed up in other groups. Guides were knowledgeable and friendly lots of fun and laughter. Good time.

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We went with Red Sail out of Rum Point. Go in the late afternoon and you will miss the cruise boat crowds. The crew members for Red sail did a great job. They get in the water with you and help you handle the string rays. Definitely a MUST do.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,This uniquely Cayman attraction is always fun! While it can be very busy at times if you visit during the slower times (no cruise ships in) it is a blast for all members of the family!

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,I know they come because of the food and boat engine noise but it feels very disneyesque Not terribly authentic as you are in the water with dozens of others but then again how often do you get a chance to swim with sting rays The nearby reef was spectacular wish we had had more time there
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,There were a lot of sting rays and we liked that they were free to interact or not. Thanks to Izona and Eddie for the wonderful tour.

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Sting Ray City was one of the first places we visited the very first time we came to Grand Caymans our kids were little and they have never forgotten it and we love to visit everytime we come!! Captain Marvins is the Best!!!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,We had a wonderful relaxing day on the catamaran with Lorenzo and Rodney. Rodney was right on time to pick us up at the dock. He is also very interactive with all the people on the catamaran at stingray city and while snorkeling. Great 5 hours exclusion would definitely recommend.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,What an awesome place! The water is shallow enough to stand up - I'm 5'3" and water was just above my hips. The sting rays come right to you swimming through your legs and splashing you with their fins. The shoulder massage is not to be missed and have your picture taken getting a kiss ;-)
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Great waters ... friendly sting rays! Our family really enjoyed this ... we booked with Captain Marvins ... they were fantastic!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,I was a bit hesitant but so glad I did it. It is such an amazing thing to be in the water with all these gentle curious creatures. They swam right up on you around you and over you! They were very gentle and friendly. Trust me. This is a definite must on your trip to Cayman.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Went to Sting Ray City on a private tour - Islandlife Watersports. Our guide Andrew was very knowledgeable and very careful with the rays. This is a beautiful sandbar area out in the ocean - you need a boat for access. Water is clear and plenty of sting rays to see and touch.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,My family enjoyed this more then I could've ever imagined. The water was beautiful and warm. The tour guides were helpful and knowledgeable about the sea life.You ride a charter boat out to the sand bar for about 20 min which was relaxing in its self. A must do when visiting Cayman Island!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,This is a great place to visit. Boat ride out to sand bar takes about 30 min. You then hop in the water and the sting rays are every where.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,see more in my "georgetown" review. This is the TO DO thing in georgetown. Unique clean friendly. dont be scared pet them front to back and nothing bad can happen
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Yup a snorkeling trip with some hands on with sting rays. You get to feed them some octopus. What an amazing trip. I highly recommend doing this.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,This is a great place to visit. Even the very young can enjoy. I recommend any tour that is on the small side. The larger boats get too hectic. You get a much better experience on a boat with 20 or so than you do on the big double decker type boats
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,This place was amazing. Even my daughter (21) who is squeamish ended up loving the experience. And yes she did kiss the stingray! We used Marineland Tours to take us out to the site. Go and do not miss this wonderful experience!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Went with SlackEm charters with four teens/pre-teens. Awesome experience to be able to swim with touch and hold the sting rays. Very unique worth the time and money. If possible choose days with few cruise ships in town (it is easy to find out on-line or from locals) since the rays get over-fed and thus less interactive on those days.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Swimming with Rays is an amazing experience. They seem to fly underwater with tremendous grace. No trip to Cayman is complete without this experience.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Crowded but fun. How often do you get the chance to swim feel feed and kiss stingrays? A great way to spend some time on the island.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,

g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,This was a great trip. We heldpettedand kissed stingrays. Very unique experience.The guides at Captain Marvin's knew the stingrays and named them. They were comfortable with them so that helped us be comfortable with them.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Not quite what we expected but how educational and cool! We took jet skis out to Stingray City - the water was super choppy that day and the ride was rough - too rough! My daughter and I banged heads and I had a black eye the rest of the vacation! Take a boat there!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Great fun for everyone. Sting rays are like the dogs of the sea. They like to be fed and petted (underneath). You stand waist deep in calm water.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,if you've never touched held or fed a stingray before you have to do this. I don't know anywhere else you can have an experience like this. Go!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Thought this would be just a huge tourist trap. I guess in a way it was but I would go back in a heartbeat. the tour operator was so informative on stingray and being out in the middle of the ocean was just a crazy experience I am glad I had. A definite must do!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Moby Dick tour was excellent & guides care about rays which speaks volumes of them!!! We had 5 in our group ages 15-42. We all fully enjoyed our time with the rays:)
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Much more enjoyable diving with the stingrays than simply snorkeling in my opinion but I'm sure everyone has a great time regardless. These guys are some very kool creatures and that moral knows he's struck a gold mine when it comes to free treats. A very relaxing side trip.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,I know it sounds cliche but this is one experience that I'll never forget. Standing in the middle of the Caribbean in waist-deep water miles off the coast as sting rays glide by is just indescribable.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Me and several co-workers rented a private yacht for the day and this was one of our destinations. There was lots of stingrays and they come right up to you with ease. This is a nice place to visit and there is always several charters anchored there.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,This is probably one of the coolest things I have ever done. The water is the prettiest color blue and the sting rays are so cool and friendly. Getting to kiss touch and get a massage from a sting ray is a really amazing experience. I can't wait to go back.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,All Day Beach Baby!!!!....Beach Food Jet Ski's....gets no better! We always go when we come to the Cayman Islands. Perfect place and way to spend the day.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,This trip to see the Stingrays was great. And yes we kissed the Stingray for "good luck". We loved snorkeling on the reef and our guides were wonderful. One of the crew members dove in and brought up a starfish for us to examine as he spoke.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Traveled here on a cruise and we absolutely loved it! I was a little scared at first but within minutes the guides were in the water and helping me get the full experience. By the end of the tour I was kissing the sting rays!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Go......2 thumbs up. Loved it. It's one of those bucket list things. I would do it again in a heartbeat.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,unbelieveable experience a must do you can snorkel or swim or just stand and let them swim by! dont go when all the cruise liner passengers go!!!!
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,I know this is something everyone goes to but it's still special. You get right up close and personal. Great snorkeling and conch diving too.
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,
g147365,d2198364,February 8 2016,Best experience ever! Petting holding kissing & feeding these amazing creatures is something that you must do!

g147367,d2385044,March 7 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 7 2016,Wonderful beachstaff so helpful.In fact greatest guy Joey even tad our chairs and towels set out for us each day.Guys are fantasticso friendly.
g147367,d2385044,March 7 2016,This was a day trip very easy to get to from the cruise ship. The water and sand is amazing. Pliantly of area to stretch out and enjoy the beach and watch people.
g147367,d2385044,March 6 2016,I liked the famous seven mile beach but there are so many hotels that have claimed parts of the beach that people tend to congregate around the same areas and it can get very crowdy.
g147367,d2385044,March 5 2016,We first stumbled upon Seven Mile Beach while looking for a grocery store. We parked along the street in front of the Marriott Hotel and walked in from the public access trail. The beach was amazing and very well maintained.
g147367,d2385044,March 5 2016,Stunning sand stunning turquoise sea stunning views and wonderful safe swimming a must see and must be one of the best beaches in the world.
g147367,d2385044,March 5 2016,Truely "The Caribbean's Best Beach" and the food was perfect. From the time you arrive you are greeted with warmth and a smile. The people are the best part of Grand Cayman.
g147367,d2385044,March 5 2016,Beautiful white sand beach and turquoise waters. The beach was not crowded during our December visit. You can walk the entire beach if you like. Nothing more to say. It's a great beach.
g147367,d2385044,March 5 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 5 2016,The beach boasts lovely sand and beautiful clear blue seas typical of the Caribbean. We walked the length of the beach and it really is a very long way! There are lots of water sports available if you wish to take part or lots of places you can hire sunbeds to sit back relax and take in the beautiful scenery.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Such a breathtaking view with warm light blue waters. Sand is nice in some areas but we found the waterfront rocky and kept stumbling upon broken green pieces of glass along the whole shore.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,I will be back! Seven miles of beautiful sand and sun what's not to like? The sun sets are gorgeous and in early December the beach isn't very busy
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Best beach ever! Stroll or have a cocktail. Feel the stress melt away. Go for a dip in the ocean and get a sun tan. Theres a reason this is rated one of the top beaches in the world! ;)
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Awesome sand and water. The beach is sooooo long and powdery white sand. Water will cool you off. Some places there have a steep drop when you get in but on a hot day jump in.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,1st time we have been here that the beach stinked way behind on clean up took 4 days to clean the beach
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,It is a very pretty beach and you can walk for miles on it. The beach is very clean and the people are freindly. At high tide the beach really vanishes in some areas so know where and when your walking. It is a $5.00 cab ride from the cruise port to the beach.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Expansive seven mile beach looks better than the pictures. Even on a cloudy day it's still great relaxation.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Best place to escape the milling crowds disgorged by the hideously large cruise ships. Enough room for everyone if you prefer to be far from the madding crowd. Clean fine white sand. Everything you would expect from a tropical island.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,This beach was absolutely beautiful. We relaxed on our lounge chairs in between wading in the clear blue waters. This was absolute paradise. We can't wait to visit again!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We spent most of our 6 days on Grand Cayman right on the beach. The sand never got hot the water was warm and the water was so clear and calm made it perfect for floating and other water sports.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,The beaches are for snorkelling water sports walking and some nice bars/cafes. Water is clear with amazing blues that allow you to see fish through the water. Beaches are public although grounds leading to many are private.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,The Caribbean sea color has various shades of blue along the 7 Mile Beach in Grand Cayman. Calm sea but uneven level to the sand. Not wide but very pleasant with good shade of trees at Governor Beach for example.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Of the many Caribbean and Mexican beaches I have been on this is the top. No hawkers or loud party crowds
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,The beach is easy to gain access to and if you like to people watch this is the place! At the public beach access next to Calico Jacks you can rent chairs and umbrellas and grab plenty of mixed drinks and beer by the bucket.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Some beaches belong to the hotel directly behind them. A security guard will come up and ask you if you are staying at their hotel. if you're not they'll ask you to move. Stay off of their furniture and you'll be fine
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We've been to all of the top Florida Hawaii and some of the other top Caribbean beaches and this is by far the best. Diving or snorkeling from shore with the postcard quality water.... amazing. The beaches are clean and plenty of wildlife to see too. The beaches aren't overrun with the cruise crowd either.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,You just have to visit the beach and go barefoot nothing to worry about. Beautiful sand amazing water. Perfect in every way.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,sadly I do not remember the name of the resort where we used the beach. Just found a cab at the port and they took us there. It was clean beautiful and well serviced. Had the best conch fritters and premium drinks while enjoying the sun and beach. Great day.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Seven mile beach is sugar white sand with crystal clear blue/green water. All the best hotels Ritz are on & mile beach.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,The name explains itself. Long nice beach. Lots of beach chair to rent water sports as well if you wish. Safe Gorgeous clear water. Lovely sunset view as well
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Very beautiful beach and worth walking in any direction. Plenty of different sites- from the quiet of the Ritz section to the overflowing bars sections.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Phenomenal beach soft sand always cool no burning your feet no need to wear shoes. Water is crystal clear and usually very gentle.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,very good beach which is safe and clean walking distance to all watersports restaurants and beach bars
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We walked Seven Mile Beach every day from our hotel. Even at 7 am there is a lot of people walking and running. Beautiful sunsets too.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Soft shell free sand few rocks now and then but not bad. Gets slanted and softer when heading north of the Ritz so not real easy to walk. The other way is great. One of the best beaches I've ever seen. Extremely clear clean calm water. We stayed at the Ritz.. But walked it both ways
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We have travelled a great deal but cannot recall a more fun winter getaway. With record breaking cold temperatures at home we soaked up the sun had fabulous food at the wharf and luka and even enjoyed seeing a wedding on the beach ( can you say " wedding crashes"? ) we will def return!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Seven Mile Beach is amazing but you will pay for it. We stayed there 3 nights and stayed at Rum Point 5 nights. Rum Point was cheaper for 5 nights than 3 on Seven Mile Beach. It is a beautiful beach it is just not cheap.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Wonderful clean beach clear water and the Caribbean is nice and warm. Nor was the beach overcrowded
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Great beach. Could do with a few more public bars. Lovely water  great snorkelling. To many condominiums!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Beachcomber and Meridian are the best condo rental... Prime spot on SMB. Grocery stop right accross the street feels like home :)
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,The beach at the Marriott is great plenty of chairs and umbrellas. The staff was always there to help with towels and moving umbrellas as the direction of the sun changed. Highly recommend if you like the beach. Water sports available right there.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,This Beach lived up to all of the hype. We walked almost the full length and it was beautiful. Great people watching if you just want to sit and watch as people pass by.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,During our trip to Grand Cayman we visited Seven Mile Beach. Well what can I say it´s a real Coney Island and nothing like it was when I was there over twenty years ago. If you like mobs of people jet skis etc well then this is the place for you.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Clean pretty beach not much shelling but peaceful and beautiful... Wish there were more bars along the beach but we enjoyed ourselves
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Seven Mile Beach is one of the best beaches in the world. The beautiful white sand crystal clear blue water and awesome shore snorkeling make this beach a must!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,no dislikes other than maybe the food is a little pricey. but really some of the best food i have ever had. look for those little whole the the walls and you will not believe it!!!!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Snorkled offshore. Saw lots of trash on the way out to the reef. Disappointing. The beach itself is beautiful.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,While 7 Mile beach is well developed and can be crowded there is a reason for this. Grand Cayman is clean accessible family friendly and home to one of the great beaches in the world. Great food diving/snorkeling water sports and exercise options in the area makes this a winning place for a family vacation.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,One of the best beaches in the Caribbean. Sometimes a bit rocky as you wade into the surf especially closer to Georgetown. If you are looking for a condo rental be aware that anything south of Plantation Village is more ironshore than beach.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Loved walking along this beach white sand and very blue sea!...We saw many sights jet skis boating water skiing assailing and lovely homes too.

g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,This has to be one of the most beautiful beaches anywhere- the clear clean Aqua blue water and white sand are just hard to beat. And you can snorkel close to the shore seeing all sorts of tropical fish! Love it!!!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,all the hype is true...this is a gorgeous beach with crystal clear water and very gentle waves. it's a perfect place to relax or play. all of the beaches on grand cayman are public so just walk up to a resort and enjoy the view! beach chairs and cabanas are available to rent but the sunshine is free!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Had to pinch my self to make sure I was not dreaming. The water was absolutely beautiful. The food and drinks were delicious.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Love the crystal clear water and friendly atmosphere. Volley ball sets are played constantly music very clean and safe. Nobody tries to sell you anything. Awesome. I suggest royal palms or calicko jacks to enjoy music and cocktails too.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,A must is a walk along the beach you can stop at numerous beach pubs to cool off. Carry something to keep your room key credit cards and cash dry. We had little carriers from the dive shop that was water proof
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,One of the prettiest beaches in the Caribbean that is rough only when the wind is blowing from the North Northwest. Soft white sand calm and warm water!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Water is wonderful the sand is soft and great for early morning jog. Even on a rough day the ocean is very calm. Great for snorkeling.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Fabulous beach to walk/run along. Snorkeling is stunning offshore from the Governor's House. Only thing to be mindful of is the washed-up coral on the beach which is the same color as the sand (watch where you are stepping!)
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We spent four days on seven mile beach each one was better the the first. Someday I will return to the relaxing place in the sun It's been below 0 all week in NY State.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Crystal clear calm stunning water with lots of restaurants bars and water sports. No need to go elsewhere!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,It is one of the best beaches I have ever been on. It is great for walking/running and the sand is the whitest I've seen. The water is a light blue and very warm.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We walked as far as we could see not a speck of garbage - nice and clean! We passed a few really nice hotels and condos too. Places to stop along the way for a drink and some eats too!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Me and my family stayed in Sunshine suits for a week in seven mile beach the hotel is close to Fosters foodand some nice restaurants walking for 5 minutes and you will see the amazinh beach of Grand Cayman
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Very nice needs a f w more places to get a drink or coffee for morning walkers. Sand nice and white.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Snorkling at the Marriot is amazing with he "reef balls" The turquoise water and white sand is amazing. Lots of coral rocks though. But the beach faces west which makes for amazing sunsets.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Closeness to the beach and water. The service by the beach great plus beach front restaurant allows you to spend whole day there.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,we own a home at the west bay end of seven mile beach tiki house a wonderful place for your vacation rental. look it up on trip advisor single family home accommodates up to eight people not just another condo
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Weather colors humidity waves service things to do in the water sand. Everything was perfect. Also it is very safe and clean
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,this beach was just what we were looking for... could walk for hrs up and down it. waves were very minimal so made for very relaxing wading in the shallows. good for kids for sure
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,AMAZING beach with beautiful one of the most crystal clear blue ocean waves.... the sand and view is breath taking and life changing
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,This is one of the better beaches if one wants to relax and enjoy the water and the sun. It's a treat to be on a beach that is extremely clean and well groomed.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Amazing beach.....perfect for families! Stay on this side of the island and take day trips to Rum Point. You cannot beat the view of Seven Mile Beach!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,This is an amazing beach. Seven miles of our sand. Great for long walks. Warm temperature. Colour of water is turquoise. Do need to watch when you walk in water. There are sea urchins on occasion. Not nice!!!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We have been coming here for 30 years. Many changes over that time. The one constant variable is the beach beautiful white sand very safe and good for snorkelling and swimming. Plenty of good food available all along the beach. Watch the Pelicans dive for fish. The sunset over the Carribean sea is magical.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Can be crowded in places and restaurants pricey. The beach is beautiful with blue green crystal clear water and perfect sand. An enjoyable visit
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Right of this beach is the Beachcomber Reef with lots of fish Lobster ( a protected species here)  and turtles.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Most beautiful water.....Tiffany Blue soft creamy colored sand and the most beautiful sunsets! Great for walking every morning it's super clean!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Awesome beach  super and waters we rented kayaks and snorkeled all at surprisingly reasonable prices  The place to eat at the beach has a nice Grouper platter and a deal for the buckets of beer  and a CLEAN Bathroom will go here next time w visit.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Great area. Lots of restaurants and the Westin Beach is terrific. Not too crowded and a great beach side restaurant.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Better than the beach at West Bay as there are a lot of pieces of coral that was up and are hard to step on and hit your ankles!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We loved everything. We went on a Culinary Tour in Georgetown swimming with the sting rays and a moonlight cruise on a catamaran to Rum Point and had dinner.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,It is a very nice beach very sandy and the water is crystal clear the only thing is that it can be very crowded and some restaurants can be expensive.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,one of the most beautiful beaches. Can be lots of people in certain areas but you have 7 miles of beach to pick a good spot!!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We have stayed on several occasions on 7 Mile Beach the beautiful beach with all the water activities imaginable are at your disposal. The popular restaurants are at this location all very walkable from the many hotels and timeshares. Awesome Location!!!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,we were taken to the public beach part of 7 mile beach from the cruise line PRINCESS ..jan 10 2015 the beach is almost gone ..quite a dropoff to get into the water not fun ..a lousy 3 hours.. 37.00 dollars each...
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,It was worth seeing but is completely PACKED with tourists off of the cruise ships. I am glad we went but can honestly say that the beaches on Grand Cayman have so much to offer and seven mile beach isn't the best one we visited.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,What a beautiful place! I loved our visit to Seven Mile Beach and am already planning another trip. Beautiful sand and some of the prettiest calm water I have seen. Rentals are available for just about any water sport you can imagine.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,White sand clear blue and easy surf to walk along the water's edge. Soft and clean beach and always safe. Swimming and snorkeling is safe and popular. Lots of water sports available. Can walk for miles and stop for lunch at various hotels.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,This is a wonderful beach. Plenty to do (or not) as you wish. The fish are plentiful. The water is beautiful. The people are friendly. And the weather was 74-84 in February
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Seven Mile Beach is actually less than 6 miles long but it is still nice. Pure white sand crystal clear sea and great sunsets. The beach is lined with big hotels and restaurants and there is plenty to do or just chill.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Beautiful beach that can get a bit crowded but who cares. The water is so crystal clear and warm all you do is relax. There are plenty of places to rent snorkeling equipment if you want or sign up for water sports or rentals. A beautiful beach.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Beautiful beach. Nice calm ocean to float in. Crystal clear water in numerous shades of blue. Great beach for long walks as well.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Was the most beautiful beach I have seen. Pristine sand and beautiful clear water. Very mellow (plus/minus whether you like that).
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Can't go wrong. It's beautiful. Perhaps a little grubby after the flock of cruisers leave all their garbage behind on the public beaches.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,It's not the best beach I've seen but it's good. Clear waters kind of rough for me though. Is better to relax and enjoy the view than to swim. As regards the area it's pretty much like Cancun: shops and dining spots along the road.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Beautiful beach great for exercise romantic walks. The beach and the views change as you walk a real pleasure. You can see the cruise ships in the distance and as they come in and out of the harbor...
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,I've not been to many beaches. But I am totally in love with this beach. The crystal clear water. The beautiful sand. And the most spectacular sunsets you will ever see. Friendly people every morning during my walks on the beach!!! I will come back as often as I can!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,What a beautiful beach it goes on and on. Walking the beach all you hear is the waves and all you see is crystal clean blue water... The water was warm and sea life abundant.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Beautiful beach with warm water and lite surf. Nice to walk and see different resort complexes some busy and some mellow.Not as mellow and secluded as some places like Anguilla. When you walk out the front door of your resort you will think you are in a different world.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We stayed right on Seven MIle Beach the water is immaculate and the beach is pristine. There is great snorkling right off the beach and the visibility is amazing. Lots of great food and shopping along Seven Mile Beach and beautiful views.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Eighty five degrees everyday clean clear water that it seems you can look down into for miles. This is just a great overall place to visit. Lovely people and beaches. Love the weather and the breezes..
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,pristine beaches and aquamarine waters! priceless!! everyone minds their own and yet friendly. great to walk along the strip and stop and eat just about anywhere will be good food and drinks!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We are not beach people but this a one of the more beautiful stretches of developed beach we have seen in our travels.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Stayed at Cayman Reef resort and there is lots to do during the day and lots of bars on the beach at night. the water looks great and the sand is smooth!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,If you are looking for an amazing beach to just sit and relax on...look no further. I'm sure there are sections that are busier but we were near the westin hotel. Nothing but relaxation wherever we looked>
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,A bautiful perfect carribean beach. Def must visit while at grand cayman. Perfect sand unlike other cayman rocky beaches and some great snorkling as well.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Not sure whether this is exactly seven miles long but it has just about everything you would want to see in terms of hotels rentals food shopping or otherwise.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Got a taxi from the pier for 5 USD per person - one way. It's beautiful stretch of beach with different parts to it. Can get very crowded when there lots of cruise ships in the port. But beautiful soft white sands and crystal warm waters.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Not what it was years ago… slowly turning into Jamaica… lots of Cruise ship people bussed in and littering.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Perfect beach with miles (7 of them!) of sundrenched ultra soft sand and perfect water temps. Snorkeling is some of the best in the world.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Amazingly clear blue green waters awesome free snorkeling and reefs and lots to do in and around this great and historic beach. It is all national protected open space and open to everyone.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Great beach but it is literally 7 miles. Our friends were dropped off in a different place by the shuttles from the ferries and we didn't see them the whole day!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Lovely beach lots of facilities watersports food etc only 10 mins from cruise port about 20$ return in taxi
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We enjoyed the gorgeous beach on a Sunday afternoon. It was basically deserted. I understand that when the cruise ships are in it is a different story.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Length of the beach and the never ending white sand. Waves create a little one foot drop off by water's edge.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,What more does one need? The temperature was great it wasn't too crowded and it was very clean. One of the best beaches I have been to in the Caribbean.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,White sand warm water that goes on forever. Not crowded and great for snorkeling. Nothing negative to say about the beach just awesome
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,What else can you ask for!!!! Crystal clear blue water and soft white sand. Snorkeling is awesome as well. One thing I suggest is to go to a private beach versus a public one.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Immediately when we docked we walked to the Seven Mile Beach. Crystal clear waters and white sand. That's what a vacation is about.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,magnificent sand and water. access to snorkeling. bars and restaurants close on the main road. relatively quiet up and down the beaches with the exception of a couple of beach clubs which are actually fun and nice but busy when cruise ships are in.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Highly overrated. Packed with people lunch is good restrooms are clean but I feel like we definitely over payed just to sit on the beach. We'd have been better off getting out on our own.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Beautiful white sand and clear water that doesnt seem to end. Good snorkeling. Plenty of resorts with food drinks and water activities. One of the prettiest beaches Ive ever seen.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,sand is silky nice long walk or jog! Never crowded! View is serene and as the name it is a long beach! It opens my heart!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,I have visited many beaches around the world & none comes close to SMB for sand quality depth & length of the beach sandy water entry water clarity calmness warm temperature and easy access.mm
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,

g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,The beach itself is great. Walking on the beach is perfect with low tide around 4pm and high tide around 9pm. Beautiful aquamarine water gentle waves. Perfect.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,It's one of the most incredible beaches in the world. The sand is soft and fine the water gorgeous and warm. Not too rocky. Exactly what a Caribbean beach should be! Very good snorkeling in parts and some world-class diving just off shore!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We are staying right in the middle of seven mile beach. Reminds us of Turks and Caicos beach beautiful white sand and crystal clear water. Facing west also makes it a great sunset view that never gets old.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,The beach is good but the activities to do on the beach are limited. Also the bar/ resturant on the beach is espensive and the food is average.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Quite simply if you have an affinity and appreciation for beaches Seven Mile Beach is simply SPECTACULAR !!!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Seven mile beach is lovely with beautiful sand and warm water. However when the cruise ships are in it can get a little crazy.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,February of 2012 we spent our last day there before flying home. it is a beautiful beach. white sand and beautiful water!! lots of stuff to do there. lots of people watching. swimming surfing etc. we hung out at calico jacks and had lunch and beers.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Actually stayed at Comfort Suites located just 50 feet from the beach. Water was calm with chairs and umbrellas set up.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We have been to some amazing beaches but this beach is better than any I have ever seen. The water is so clear and beautiful. We are already trying to arrange our next trip.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Of the 5 caribbean islands we have been to this beach is by far the best. It is as smooth as glass very little wave activity at the shore line clear to the bottom no matter how deep it is not rocky only clean white sand.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,This is just a beach with a lot of people not really my cup of tea. There are loads of shops and things around this area as well.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We purposely stayed on the Eastside to avoid the crowds but took a day to visit Seven Mile Beach. It was much busier then where we stayed but the Island people welcomed everyone with a smile and service was great at each stop we made!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Wonderful beach. It's so long that you never really feel overcrowded since people spread out. The sand is white and so fine you just want to leave your feet in all day! The water was clear and clean. No corals or rocks at our location (Royal Palms). Highly recommend this beach stop!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Beautiful soft deep sand. Gorgeous warm azure water. Wall to wall with people jammed between American hotels and the water. Would try and find a more remote beach.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,The beach was more crowded than I like but nice. Walking SMB was nice but the beach isn't very wide (like walking on a hill). Snorkeling off shore was nice but we had to go out about a hundred feet to see corals and lots of fish. Water was very clear and good temp.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We walked up and down Seven Mile Beach during the whole trip. It is beautiful! The water is clear the beaches are nice and the weather was great. We did a parasailing trip though the Marriott and it was great too.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,

g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,I like it. I It was fun I went there with my son we had wonderful time. when I went there I rested then went for a swim it very fun
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,This beach is really amazing. It is best to stay away from the big hotels is you want a little bit more privacy andess cruise ship crowds.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,

g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Wow! Beach is excellent. Staff and food are outstanding! The best location on Seven Mile Beach.cant wait to try the new water park with my grandbaby.

g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Though we found the rest of Grand Cayman to be a bit run down for the most part the beaches were magnificent. We tried to go as often as possible and to different locations. They were all good.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,SMB is truly one of the best clear water white sand beaches I have visited and I've been to a lot of beaches. This was absolutely the best time on the beach I have spent in a long time! No debris no jellyfish no crabs no sea foam or smell. Clean and warm and perfect!!!!!!!!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Great local bar. Pretty busy with cruise ship visitors mid-day but great in the afternoon and for sunsets.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,One of the best in the Caribbean. Plantana condos are a perfect place to stay. Governors reef is easy beach snorkel
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We stayed at the Marriott and we would walk the beach everyday soft white sand and blue water for miles.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Beautiful white sand beaches turquoise waters and extremely friendly locals. Great place to lay in the sun and relax!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Went to Royal Palm Beach Resort- the food was great and the beach grand! The water is gorgeous! Very good service and nice facilities for changing.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Its a beautiful beach with white sand. Different shades of water and very close to downtown Georgetown which is the capital. That's where the cruise ships dock. Just a beautiful area..get a chair and umbrella and spend the day.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We stayed at the Islands Club on SMB. This is a very beautiful beach with soft sand and gentle waves. We saw many people paddle boarding out here.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Wow what an awesome beach check it out. Beautiful sand quiet and pleasant. Looks like it should be a postcard photo!! Great place to spend the day or a week!!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,It's lovely that the island has so many public entrances. We stayed right on the beach but I hated how busy our space got with all of the tourists that are dropped off by the cruise ships. Brings a lot of trash to the beach.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Clear blue water and pristine sand! Amazing Sunsets! Very relaxing...nobody trying to sell you stuff.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,It doesn't get better than this. Cool refreshing breezes and miles upon miles of white sand beaches. What's not to like...
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Beautiful warm water mostly calm & clear great for non-swimming kids very clean extra bonus in that there is some off-shore snorkeling too very soft sand in most parts some busy parts of beach around all the hotels but quieter parts up north. Kids are already asking to return!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Seven MIle Beach has got to be the reason people come here. Soft white sand turquoise waters and bars restaurants and hotels overlooking it all. Not the most affordable place I've ever been though and I have found great beaches in Jamaica and the Gulf side of Florida that are just as nice but less costly.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Get there early before the beach fills up. $5USD there and $5USD back. You pay for each lounge chair and more for an umbrella.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Went to royal Palms and enjoyed the beach and food. Warm clean and sugar sand make the beach one of our favorites!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Best Beach I have experienced. You can walk forever in the white fluffy stand no shells crystal clear water.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,I love 7 Mile Beach! The water is clear and during the day...pretty calm. Far enough away from the cruise ship runoff/pollution. Many terrific restaurants and food shacks are on this beach. Also it's pretty handy in most places to get back out of the sea and on the beach.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Warm clear water. You can see the fish swim around you and pelicans diving in to grab them while you swim five feet away. Great for children and plenty of water sports too.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,This is such a beautiful beach !!!!! The water is so clean and clear ! I wish everyone could see this place at least once. We can't wait to go back!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Although there were lots & Lots of people there we never felt crowded and had a blast in the warm sand and the bright blueish green waters that just made you feel so Amazing and Happy! This is a Must Stop if in this area!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Nice beach great sunsets. Most of the stuff on the island is here. Most beaches are a part of the hotel property
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,This beach is incredible and HUGE (though not 7mi long - about 4). Walk along and see all the fancy resorts dip into the water go snorkeling at a number of sites for good fish sightings. Though for the real deal get away from the beach to see the real colors of the coral.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We stayed on the south end and there was an area where the sea weed and some kind of urchins washed up on shore every night...it was kind of nasty. The rest of the beach was fairly clean...great place for a long walk if once you're past the seaweed
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We stayed at the Island Club and it is like having your own private beach. White sand and clear blue water. What more could you ask for!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,If you come to Grand Cayman then you can't avoid Seven Mile Beach. It is a sandy oasis of serene beauty with giant hotels/resorts overlooking the blue sea. It's bliss!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Great for just relaxing. The bad thing was they charged for chairs and any water activities. We brought our own snorkel gear. The water was clear in some sports and rocky in others but all in all was a great experience.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Stayed at the Westin on 7 Mile Beach and had a fantastic time. The white sand beach is great for walking the beach or going into the ocean for a swim. Most days I was there the water was very calm and made it great for kids playing at the edge of the water.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Cramped luxury hotels to close to each other but the water of the beach and the sand was priceless...
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Beautiful beach everyone had a great time the floating fun things are a laugh people got hurt stupid idiots . Sunbathing
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Having a rental car help you to see seven mile beachs that is only 5 miles long. Just like the rest of the Caymans everything is absolutely beautiful!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Was quite a site to experience We came on a day when there were 4 Cruise Ships very busy. You have to experience it at least once
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,It was beautiful and clean and better than most other islands that I visited. It was not crowded and no one bothered you with selling things. Very relaxing and lovely.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Clean clear water safe snorkelling can walk the length of it too. Not hassled by anyone unlike most beaches we have ever been on. Lots of watering holes. We liked the fact there were public beaches too and even clean public toilets! Nothing to fault it apart from people smoking.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Wooow One of the best beaches we went do. Excellent for swimming relaxing and walking. Excellent neighborhood good restaurant within walking distance and good shopping. Excellent hotels.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,This beach is close to perfect. Sand is white & easy to walk on. Long walks along the beach are perfect. Water is warm & you can see to the bottom. Snorkeling is good in several areas right off the shore. There are a few sea urchins on occasion so do watch your footing.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Visited here when we were taking a cruise and really enjoyed ourselves doing some shopping and drinking some local beer. Met some really nice locals and picked up a few things for the kids along the way!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,One of the nicest beaches I have seen. Very picturesque with warm beautiful water!!! It's an easy cab ride from the cruise port. A very nice beach day!!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Nice beach buzzing with people and activities. Not much to see as far as diving or snorkelling but the land life is very nice.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Loved the beach but be sure to use 30 sunscreen bring an umbrella as there is little shade and lots of water! Great beach to swim in...the water is amazingly crystal clear blue!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Colors temperature and water clarity is superb. This is a paradise for snorkeling ir scuba diving or just plain relaxing taking in a swim and the views
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We enjoyed a stay at South Bay condominiums on the Seven Mile Beach. Our stay was thoroughly enjoyable with walking the beach and proximity to Georgetown and Camana Bay.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We went to this beach on a whim and LOVED it! I cannot wait to go back to GC just to spend some more time at this beach
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We entered on the side of a cemetary and it took us to a non crowded beach that was beautiful. The people were friendly and the snorkeling great. Water is so warm you can stay in till you prune.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,open bar on beach with best food ever. run by Canadians. Wifi. beautiful beach. loved the free roaming chickens. loved the flip flop tree!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Seven Mile Beach has the softest finest white sand I have ever seen. Breathtaking coastline. Both romantic and fun for family adventures! I highly recommend.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Best place to play and stay and dive and relax and eat at the multitude of restaurants. Discovery Point #45 is just wonderful to stay at!!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,wonderful place to dip your feet in the water. An organized tour is the best way to go and not have to pay for all the extras that most of the beachside places charge.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,You had to pay to go to the beach which we didn't find out about till the day of wanting to go to the beach
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We've been all over the Caribbean and no where else is there such a long stretch of uninterrupted white sand beach that is equally safe with as many great restaurants and snorkeling galore! Stop by the reef balls in front of the Marriott with your gear and see tons of fish.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We've stayed on many islands/beaches...Aruba Punta Cana St. Croix St. John St. Thomas St. Maarten Turks & Caicos Cabos San Lucas Cancun South Beach Nantucket...hands down 7 Mile Beach is the best. Went 20 years ago went back last week....don't know why I waited so long! Clean white sand gorgeous water just the best.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We walked a lot but had to fight with the rain almost every trip. We suggested taking the umbrella with you all the time. Watch the weather before leaving. The rain came one place but the other may not have it.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Clear waters beautiful beach fun times. Tourist from all over the world. Just a taxi cab or several mile walk away!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Seven Mile Beach is beautiful but some of the sand was rough. It’s walkable & very busy in some parts. I still prefer Grace Bay!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,The sand is very particular it contains shells and strange rocks and other things i spent half an hour just pulling a handful from the bottom of the sea and watching what was inside every time was different and interesting.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,No sea grass! I love it. This is a beautiful white sand beach; it's what the magazines advertise but you rarely find. The water is clear and beautiful. The people are friendly. It's safe. It's dog-friendly. And the entire beach is public! What more could a beach-goer ask for? Superb.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Costs 5.00 per person by taxi to get to the beach. There are bathrooms and changing rooms . For additional money get a chair and umbrella on the beach. Only negative is beer is overpriced but what a view. No decent beach in walking distance for cruise ships pay for taxi
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Beautiful That's all I need to say... I would highly recommend this to anyone because of the beautiful beaches and warmth of the water makes you feel so chilled
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Stayed at the Ritz-Carlton on Seven Mile Beach and the beach is one of the beast we have ever visited. Sand is like powder no rocks or seaweed. Amazing sunsets too.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,This beach is stunning and there is so much space - so you don't feel crowded or on top of people. The snorkelling is fantastic - the water is crystal clear and there are so many species of fish to look at!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,This beach has lots of public access walking allies. The water is clear & warm. Very good snorkling.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We spent a pleasant afternoon at this gorgeous beach snorkeling and collecting shells amid the white sands. We rented a locker to hold our backpacks. They charged $10.00 but at least we didn't have to worry about losing our belongings. Beautiful beach clear water white sands great time!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,There are a lot of hotels and restaurants along Seven Mile Beach. We enjoyed watching the sunset and walking on the beach
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,miles & miles of white and pink sand.Just start walking and you'll discover so many things and places. People are very friendly.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,what beach? entire area is blocked by hotels with little access to reach the beach. reaching the main beach required searching of tiny access walking path to gain access to the beach
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,quiet nice beach tho a bit hard to find park in front of cemetery at N end of SMB and follow path to right of cemetery to beach
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Walking the beach is great. Very soft sand no pebbles or stones. Great sunset views. Ample parking beach access and Calico Jacks is great for casual food and cold drinks.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,My husband and I came here during Spring break. It was a bit crowded but it was still amazing! The water has perfect visibility you could see everything!! The sand is a gorgeous white. Can't wait to go back!!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Beach itself is incredible. The island is very safe and friendly the beach is clean and exactly like what you see in travel magazines the facilities are great and abundant.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,I really really love Grand Cayman! there is a very good and famous beach called Seven Mile! a beautiful turquoise and clear water with a powder sands....lovely place in the world
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,If you stay away from the cruise ship dock area you can find a pretty spot to enjoy yourself and let the kids splash in shallow waters or just nap in the shade!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,The beach itself is nice but the area is way over built. Unfortunately the restrictions on the height of the buildings has changed and the buildings are to tall.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,I loved the view we had a great area for pictures and for tanning. we were there in September so the crowd was just a small one.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,This seven mile stretch of beach is beautiful. It is very crowded but truly something to behold. The waters are a deep aqua color. I believe this may be the best beach in the Caribbean. If you're looking for a tropical beach vacation this would certainly be in my top ten.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,This is the best beach I have been to it is so long you can always get away from the crowd. White soft sand beach warm ocean and the views are amazing. if you want an amazing beach that you can go to day after day after day this is it
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Whats more to say Beautiful white sandy beaches. Take a taxi from port. Not far at all really.Relax and enjoy the views.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Esp if you love warm clear water!! Lots of areas are very quiet and serene.. .If you want to hang with Big groups --- stay near the westin / Ritz or Calico Jacks.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Gorgeous.... Simply put. Enough said. Pure. Pristine. Absolutely GORGEOUS. The beach and the water are incredible the most beautiful colors I have ever seen.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,For over 15 years I have enjoyed many walks and sunsets on Seven Mile Beach. The sand is like powdery white sugar and at the waters edge it is speckled w pink coral. Its a wonderful place to relax! It should be on everyones bucket list.!!!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Grand Cayman is beautiful but the beach is VERY narrow. Tiki Beach was pricey for food but what else do you expect at a tourist trap. Still had a great day!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Beautiful crystal clear calm waters white sand quiet beaches. Spent a lot of time paddle boarding snorkeling and just relaxing.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Off peak season was fab; no crowds; lots of elbow room. Snorkeling was awesome & the sunsets breathtaking!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Wonderful experience. I will always love the beautiful beaches and sand of the Seven mile beach. The ocean water is shallow and warm. The experience is great and to see the wonderful ocean(especially right before sunset).
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Crystal clear water. fabulous sun silky sand. what more could you ask for? I dunno I kind of missed the annoying buskers and non-stop chatter of kids offering to fetch me beer or food like Cancun NOT!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Ok first it is only 5 miles not really 7. But other than that there is no better beach I can think of that has both resorts and privacy at the same time. You can even park in front of the Governors House. The water is crystal clear warm and the beaches are spotless.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,White sands crystal clear water friendly locals. Truly enjoyed my day at the beach. One of the cruise ports took a 10 min cab to the beach (3 dollars each way/pp)
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Yes this is as amazing as everyone says. However if you go make sure its not a cruise!!! First of all if your cruise happens to go on a cloudy day you are out of Luck! The water wont be as clear. If you stay in the Island these cloudy days are apart and few in between so ENJOY!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Such a beautiful beach and more options than you can imagine. Various bars facilities restrooms etc. all along the beach. Go for a stroll along the oceans' edge and check out the area. Gorgeous white sands so many shades of blue in the water......Just breath taking!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,I was on a cruise in Carabbean and the first stop was in Grand Cayman. This way I had the opportunity to visit seven mile beach! And it is simply great! the sand is clean and it has a fantastic color and also the water! it’s a real paradise!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,It's just a beautiful beach with beautiful clear water! There are man made reefs and natural reefs. I see more coral forming. Please take care and don't touch these as these are living organisms..
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Royal palm beach is the most amazing beach i've ever been. Water is clean. There is free wifi next to the bar. Atmosphere is really reaaaally good!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Cemetery Beach was the best area to swim and had a lovely beach with tress for shade. You have to walk THROUGH a cemetery which was unnerving to me but that's the way to it.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Beach was beautiful and clean with plenty of beach chairs available. Watersport were also available right on the beach
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Seven Mile Beach is still the most beautiful beach in the whole world. Sand like powdered sugar. Water like turquoise. Just perfect.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Good structure you can rent chairs and have bathrooms places to change and buy food nice place if you are in Cayman or in a cruise ship to spend the day.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Nice beach clear water lots of activities or you can just rent chairs and an umbrella ($15 for 2 chairs and an umbrella for all day) and relax on the beach. Restaurants drinks and bathrooms all close by too.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,The weather was so great although windy our last day. We walked the beach every day. Tiki beach and calico jacks are both fun beach bars. Loved it!!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Great place to "play on the sand or in the waves". Beautiful white sand beach with plenty of space to spread out. Rent a chair or umbrella or bring your own. Different spots along the beach have all the watercraft for rent.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Pretty to look at. Lots of places to hang on the beaches. There are numerous bars and hotels where you can rent a chair and snorkel stuff and just hang out.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We stayed on SMB. Beautiful area lots of great restaurants and most importantly beautiful beach. Would highly recommend this area to anyone.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Went several years back just a quick review. Built up like Clearwater Beach Florida though we stayed on the West end a more remote area. Drove on the left side (fun!) into Georgetown to visit 7 mile beaches. Best beach to us was Cemetery Beach. Nice size beach and the water looks like a swimming pool with good snorkeling.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,great beach beautiful view of sea. water perfect for any activity. sand beaches are really nice and we will be coming back
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Depending on where you hit this beach your experience may vary. The public beach entrance on West Bay road is probably the best spot...when it isn't crowded. It's a beautiful beach with lovely warm clear blue water. There are amenities as well along the beach including a bar eatery chairs changing rooms etc.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,I don't know if it's a full seven miles but it is a beautiful beach and it is the calmer side of the island and has beautiful sunsets if it's not cloudy. Great accommodations and numerous restaurants in all price points. Plenty of water sports all along the beach
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,I visited the 7 Mile Beach in Grand Cayman Jamaica and i'm in love with the white sands of this beach. The sun was inviting the sand was hot and the water was soothing. I wished i had my grandchildren on vacation because they would have simply loved this clean beach.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,One of the nicest beaches I have ever seen. White sand clear blue water and great snorkeling ! Will definitely be back!!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Seven mile beach is just gorgeous! White powdery sand clear calm turquoise waters--its so remarkable. You just want to stay all day.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Does not my title say it all?! Well I'll ad a bit. You can see the bottom of the ocean witness gorgeous sunsets rent snorkel gear at the Captain Mini Mart and see the schools of fish swim by you (they are not shy!) and simply walk this beautiful beach day or night and be in awe of it's beauty.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,This is one of the most beautiful beaches I have ever seen. The sand is white and soft and the whole beach is public. It's very clean and I just loved it. Always find coral that has washed ashore...nice souvenir...and free ;)
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Stayed in sunshine suites resorts just a block away. Water was crystal clear. Didn't feel like getting out of it at all. Kayaking Jet skiing and stand up paddle boat were available for good prices near Westin.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Good beach but too many tourists when the cruise ships are in. Some places have a sharp drop going into the water and there are some corral rocks rolling in the surf. There are better beaches on Grand Cayman (like at Rum Point) but they're too far away if you're on a cruise ship.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We thought this was going to be a gorgeous beach but maybe the part we were at was a bad spot. We were around the garbage collection area which you could smell all the way to the beach. Would not go back to this beach unless it was in a different area.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,I mean its a really nice beach but its a beach.... there is nice white sand and pretty blue water not much more to report from here. Ther
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,This is the best beach I have ever visited in my life. The water is crystal clear and warm. The sand is super clean. There is tons of restaurants and attractions everywhere. People bring their dogs along the beach too. Just wonderful.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Stopped off on the way back from captain marvins. Amazing beach lovely sand crystal clear calm sea. Everything you expect from the caribbean.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,This is a very nice beach. Very long with white sand. Close to the cruise pier. Take a ride it worth the trip
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Amazing beach with some good snorkelling. It goes on and on and on...the only complaint is that the "public" part of the beach isn't very big (there are two areas) and resorts occupy private space which isn't very welcoming to the public. A shame since it is so expansive yet resorts occupy the majority.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Crystal blue water and soft white sand. I'm still here and I never want to leave. Isn't that enough said? I don't want to go back home and face real life haha! It truly is an amazing place to be for young seniors pets... Absolutely beautiful!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Sit swim snorkle scuba raft etc. you can do it all at this beach or just sit back and relax and enjoy grand cayman sunsets
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Seven Mile Beach is a must  but very busy and expensive. It has beautiful beaches but they are hard to see from the over development. Camana Bay is nice but very expensive . Not many shops to shop at. The Gelato Shop was great.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,plan a quick 30 minute trip if you can fit it in before re-boarding the cruise ship. Gorgeous beach and great snorkeling opportunity.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,I really enjoyed this beach no crowds and a wonderful open air bar. The had a beach BBQ cook out and it was good. Watch out for the iguanas they will come to your table and beg for food.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Unbelievable beauty.....white sand and blue waters. We snorkeled around the rocks in the bay and saw yellow blue and red fish. Absolutely picture perfect!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,So relaxing. Even as a local I still am always overwhelmed with the beauty of this beach. In the day the sun gets really hot so may become overpowering...but in the evening the sunsets are just breathtaking. Definitely one of my favourite sights to see after a long day of work.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Seven Mile Beach is what you picture a tropical island beach to be like. The color of the water is breath taking contrasted by the white sands is why this beach always makes the top ten lists various groups publish all the time.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,A great beach if you like sand gentle waves and an easy swim (on most days). Anywhere along this beach is great. Great scuba diving as well.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,It's nice. You can run and walk the whole beach. Even though it is not 7 miles (more like 5 miles) but it is beautiful. You get to see people enjoy the sun and water (and of course sand).
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Enjoy your day in the sun kick back and relax. Parrot landing you can rent tanks and so a shore dive. That is one thing beautiful about the Caymans is that you are able to do shore diving. A bit pricey but the beauty of the island makes up for it.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,The beach here is very nice with clear water and clean white sand. There are various places for water sport rentals if that's your interest. The beach was crowded in certain areas and almost empty in others depending on where you were. Definitely worth checking the beach out even if you're on a cruise and have limited time.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,The water was beautiful and clear. The beach was gorgeous and we went for daily walks that were incredible. I chickened out when I saw the little fish come out near my feet but they weren't around all the time.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Crystal clear water - calm as ever! Love this beach! One of my favorite destinations of all! Easy access to just about everything within minutes.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,And if you include the calm blue sea you cannot ask for anything else. Enjoy from the very morning to the sunset - take your snorkel equipment and will see some nice interesting life.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Miles of sand and turquoise water along with glorious sun. Paradise anyone??? Great snorkeling in clear water. Good shelling for those who like to walk the beach. Put on a hat and sunscreen and enjoy yourself.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,A special beach. Many miles of beautiful sand adjacent to calm Caribbean waters. Plenty of watersports to partake of. Many of the resorts have well marked swimming areas. A perfect place for incredible sunsets.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Took at taxi that cost $4 per person each way for a simple and relaxing beach visit. No added cost. Walked up and down the beach for a couple of hours. The beach is very nice and not crowded.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Well maintained and has soft sand as opposed to the East end of the island which is full of rocks. If you go the Cayman's stay towards this side of the island. You will pay more but the cost is worth it.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We spent the day here off one of the carnival cruises we took and it was amazing. The sand honestly feels like powder. The water is calm it is a small piece of heaven on earth.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Our hotel was located on Seven Mile Beach. One of the most beautiful beaches I have seen. The water is a beautiful blue and so amazingly clean and clear. Beautiful sand water and shoreline make this a perfect beach. You can even snorkel about and see some small reefs.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Beautiful blue green clear water. Just a little rocky in certain places on the beach. Beach shoes or socks come in handy.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,This was located on Seven Mile beach. This was a good place to snorkel without leaving the resort. The sand was soft and the water was clear. Could lay on a raft and watch the fish swim underneath.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,One of the best beaches I have ever visited! The long beach is uncrowded! The ocean is gorgeous clear warm and calm! There are plenty of great places to eat along the beach and numerous locations where you can rent gear for water sports!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Wonderful sandy beach excellent snorkeling right from the shore. Kid friendly. Easy walk to the beach
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Nice beach clear water but crowded. Move out away from town to get a little less crowded area. Most areas on the beach rent watercraft snorkeling gear etc. And each area I've been to has had a restaurant.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,The water glistens a bright teal/blue the sand is so soft it's like pancake batter when wet and the sun is constantly shining. I don't know what more you could ask for. Come here walk the beach people watch snorkel and relax. It really is perfect. Best beach I have ever been to.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,There are no words to describe the water coral and sea life around the island. Seven-Mile Beach is public up to the high tide line - no matter what hotel or residence you are staying. You can snorkel from almost any point along the beach and be content for hours. Just remember to pack your sunscreen!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,stayed about 1/2 way up 7 mile beach small mostly dead coral reefs right off the beach but was fun and easy to snorkel saw turtles released from the farm at top of 7 mile.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Nothing I didn't like it's beautiful wish I had more time there. Got some great pictures aquamarine water and white sand. Beach was clean.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Can't wait to go back to Cayman and stay on SMB! Sand is beautiful weather was fabulous and lots of reefs off of Seven Mile Beach for great snorkeling.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,It's a scenic place with all the amenities needed. You can rent beach chairs visit nearby restaurants or just play in the ocean. Plenty of transportation to and from the beach.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,I love seven mile beach it is very clean. The water is crystal clear. The temperature is always perfect. I always tell my family and friends about seven mile beach.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,The white sand the green blue clear water so many tropical fish! Bring or rent a snorkel so much to see. The waters are very safe and we love it here!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,This is the main strip of the Grand Cayman island. It has some great restaurants and shopping spots. Oh and the beaches are unforgettable!!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Crowded but an absolutely lovely beach experience. The water is pristine and the sand so soft. Definitely a must-see!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Beautiful turquoise water sand however is not white but still very soft. Was not very crowded and you can go snorkeling just outside the swim area and see beautiful fish of all kinds. We will be back and not soon enough!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Just like a travel brochure--white sand and blue water! The beach is absolutely beautiful. In addition there are nice little reefs where snorkelers can see some marine life. Very safe to go for long romantic walks in the nights.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Make sure you stay until sunset. The sunsets are spectacular! The beach is clean. The white sand is soft and powdery. The ocean is a sparkling turquois blue.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Quiet relaxing...wide sand area...no waves crashing...clearest water I have ever seen....no large crowds....bring your own chairs...umbrellas...etc.....& plan to enjoy a piece of Heaven.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Sandy beach with very clear water. Great for romantic walks on the beach! The beach was real clean! It was very relaxing!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,The beaches are absolutely gorgeous. There are resorts all along the way. Many are private residences. This seems to be a quite area with no Lou's activities. You can easily find water sport rentals.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We visited this beach while on a cruise. We loved this beach! Warm water gorgeous white sand. Do not miss this beach. Worth the trip to get there.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,What paradise this is... We spent seven nights as part of our honeymoon in Cayman Islands. The beach is beautiful.. Clean.. Highly recommended.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Seven Mile Beach is gorgeous crystal clear and has calm warm waters. The sand is white and perfect for anyone including families with young children. There are many resorts on the beach and lots to do or just lounge.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,7 mile beach is pretty but there is a weird step down and has lots of rocks. I have been to much prettier beaches but it is still lovely and nice to hang out and relax.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We visited 7 Mile Beach and loved it. The water was crystal clear. The sand was soft to the touch. I would return again but you must be careful because there are parts of it that are very commercial.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We didn't stay on the beach but visited a beachfront park. Beautiful wide and long (hence name "7 Mile Beach !?!) with beautiful clear water.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,7 mile beach is a great beach with several reefs to snorkel/dive at. We stayed at a resort on 7 mile and enjoyed walking to the different reefs and swimming out to them to enjoy the fish. We saw two small sharks and a sea turtle at the reef out from the governor's house. Very cool area to snorkel!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We loved visiting 7 mile beach. The water is so clear and bath tub like. Although I did not see many fish there.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Easy to get too convenient places to eat all along seven mile across the street including an IGA known as Fosters here. Fosters has everything a grocery store could possibly have.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,This beach is absolutely gorgeous. The crystal clear water white sand and peaceful atmosphere was phenomenal. I could have spent every hour of every day of my vacation just enjoying the beauty and tranquil beach here. It was so hard to leave.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We have stayed on Seven Mile Beach all three times we have visited Grand Cayman. It is beautiful and has awesome snorkeling!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,The waters were unbelievably clear and beautiful. The fishes swam all around you when you swam. It was as if you were swimming in an aquarium!! I never experienced anything like it. It was amazing!! A must see!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,This was our 9th visit to Grand Cayman and stayed on Seven Mile Beach 7 of those visits. I have yet to find a cleaner and more stress free beach anywhere that has some of the best snorkeling around.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We have been to Seven Mile Beach five times in the last decade and absolutely love it! I highly recommend staying at a hotel along this beach front.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We loved the pristine white beach the warm turquoise water. In December. Watching the cruise ships in the distance. Very similar to the Grace beach at Turks and Caicos. Perfect in every way...
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Expansive clean beach. Crystal clear water and gorgeous white sand with no debris. No seaweed in the water or rocks. Fun to walk along and see all the different condos and resorts or stop stop in at Royal Palms for a bevie or one of the resto's for food and drinks. Great array of water sport activities available.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Uncrowded and beautiful is a perfect description for this beach. Easy to walk or run on and very clean. Early morning best for runners fewer folks. Special treat is to watch sunset!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Nothing to dislike here. Sand is perfect water is normally 80 degrees + water is crystal clear (divers and snorkelers love it). A "10".
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Before you make reservations know where you are located on SMB. Some beaches are sandy but the water is rocky so if you want to swim it would be a problem. Clear aquamarine water though.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,This is the beach of your dreams. White sand and crystal clear water. Not much shade and some rocky areas depending on location
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,CLEAN!! beautiful!! highly recommended. this was our 3rd time to Seven Mile Beach and we will go back again and again...
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,White powdery beaches. loved it. clear blue ocean. plenty of restaurants and bars. ocean shallow enough for children.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We keep coming back and love the beautiful beach friendly people. 4th year in a row! Loved parasailing stingray city and snorkeling the best
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,A wonderful place to lie and read in the shade and then cool off in the water. In front of the Marriott a mini reef is developing. We saw lobster jack fish snapper wrass to name a few!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Clear unbelievable green color warm.... All a great beach needs to have. Not a wavy beach just get on a floaty and relax!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,The beach is definitely a Top 10 in my book. Plenty of public entry ways perfect water temperature calm waters. There's a reason the Ritz and the Westin hitched their wagon to this seahorse.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We spent hours on this beautiful beach. It was not crowded. It's a great beach to walk anytime of day.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Easy access from the ships beautiful beach water is absolutely crystal clear. This is a must see if in Grand Cayman.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,The Beach is fantastic. But the large hotels on the beach are annoying. I would recommend a trip to the public beaches.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,This beach was amazing. It's got crystal clear and see thru waters. I've never seen such amazing beaches before. I've visited Bali & Thailand & there's no comparison. Highly recommend spending a day here!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Spend the day here at dock from a cruise and thoroughly enjoyed it! Beautiful water and sand. Want to go back!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We have been on many cruises and have had our share of beach days. It just doesn't get any better than this! Beautiful!!!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,What can I say? This is reputed to be one of the most beautiful stretches of beach in the world. And it deserves that reputation. Great for long walks.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Lovely area water is o beautiful even the Public beach is nice.....especially when the cruise ship passengers have left
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,White sand and calm clear water the entire length. There are a variety of bars and restaurants along the beach as well as water sports from wave runners to stand up paddle boards. Something for everyone.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Seven Mile beach is possibly my favorite beach that I've every been too. Not the bluest or the closet to reef but the best combination of swimmable warm clear and aquatic life filled waters that is also close (walkable) to the resorts. The beach naturally has soft white san. Great for kids and couples alike.

g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,IF you want a chair either bring one or be prepared to have someone greet you so you can pay for a lounge chair that is on the public side of the beach. It is beautiful great place to snorkel and have fun. Love that area!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We stayed twice here. The first time was an exclusive little bungalow where they vacumned the beach several times a day! The beach and the water are so clean! The sand is like silk it's clean and pure and soft. Our beach was private but even as we wandered to the public areas the beach was lovely. Highly recommend it.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,This is a huge expanse of beach with many hotels and public park access points. We tried snorkeling off Cemetery Beach but it was not very good at all. However the beach faces West and the sun sets can be great. Grand Cayman is expensive and you have to drive on the left.

g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Most relaxing beach I've ever been to. Beautiful sand lovely water and lounges! Been there several times and always looking forward to returning.

g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,The beach is clean the waves aren't rough some fish average snorkeling. Sand clean. The hotels along the way are the usual resort type. Nothing special
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Whether walking along the beach or driving by on the way to Hell the view is always lovely. Try the lobby bar at the Westin for good food and drinks especially their Cayman Colada.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We spent the day on Seven Mile Beach in the Caymans! Beautiful beach with crystal clear waters! We spent the day enjoying the sunshine and snorkeling! Go down to Calico Jacks and taste the Jerk Chicken and Conch Fritters!

g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,i really enjoyed my vacation and my time in grand cayman. we walked to beach each night during sunset and it was never crowded. no solicitors on the beach like in mexico. we're already thinking we may return next summer
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,The water was crystal clear it has beautiful white sand stingray sandbar is the best place that I have ever been. Feeding the stingray is an unforgettable experience ! Starfish beach had big orange starfish that we were able to photograph and sit in the water with... Cayman Islands are a wonderful place.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,No question Seven Mile Beach is a beautiful stretch of beach. I'm glad we went to see it. It's a little crowded for my taste but I rarely ever go to crowded public beaches so you have to keep that in mind. The surroundings are stunning and the sand is soft and white. A beautiful enjoyable afternoon.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Clean quiet just stunning!!! My favorite place on earth!!! Can't wait to go back again!!!!!!!!!!!!!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Beautiful beach for strolling with drinks in hands or playing with the family. Calm waters are great for water activities like snorkeling hobie cats or paddle boarding.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We went here on our cruise. There was a lot of people but I excepted it. The sand was snow white and silky. The water was not crystal clear but it was really blue.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,The Seven Mile Beach was fabulous. The sand on the Seven Mile Beach was so much lighter and softer than the sand we have home in Florida. It felt incredible underneath my toes. The water was crystal clear. It was spectacular.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Words cannot describe the pristine crystal clear waters of 7 Mile Beach and the incredible array of tropical fish one can see just steps into the water. The epitome of a tropical paradise beach.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,A great place to spend an afternoon in the Sun. Always beautiful! There are many options to enjoy a snack or beverage along the beach as well as folks willing to rent chairs and umbrellas.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Clear waters and plenty to see even in the shallow waters. The beach is awesome especially when you get away from the larger hotels and find a quiet area.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We traveled to this beach over 20 years ago and found it to be a very clean beach - Taxi ride required from almost everywhere ... bring cash.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Beautiful but crowded drinks available from local hotels. Water is breath taking!! If you enter at hotel they do charge a small fee!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,It does not get better than this soft white sand and crystal clear water with a beach that you can walk for miles its just the best.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We visited Seven Mile Beach while on a cruise and it was one of the most beautiful beaches we have ever been to. The water is so clear.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Its hard to get on to this beach unless you are staying in one of the hotels that line its edge though it is beautiful and they will let you buy cocktails and watch the sunset from their bars... For a friendly delightful beach try Rum Point.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,The private and public areas that line this stretch of sand are clean and inviting. The water is pristine and since there is little to no barrier the wave action is what you would expect for play. The sunsets from any point on this beach is worth sitting down and admiring. Most public areas have showers and changing rooms.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,What a great way to start the day....a long walk on the beach...then breakfast! After that another walk.....a mid morning coffee...then another walk....then lunch.... You get the picture!!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Loved that the beach was so clean and so close to everything! Spent a Ton of time on it walking and sunbathing!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,The seven mile beach was nice and clean but expensive. We had to pay 5 dollars per chair and a extra $5 per umbrella to lay on the beach. The most funniest thing I seen was several chickens walking on the beach. I took a picture to show my family.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We tried both the public beach and the Royal Palm beach club. The Royal Palm was more fun more convenient and better for people watching. All in all the entire stretch of beach is wonderful.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,I am not a strong swimmer I like smooth clear sand beneath my feet. Very good swimming beach awesome and clean no sea grass. Wonderful.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We have stayed on Seven Mile Beach 3 times and love it! The water is a beautiful turquoise and the sand soft and a delight to walk on - lots of nice hotels and places to dine!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Fantastic water with wonderful views. Sand is amazing and clean Large and walkable. Bars and restaurants are there so you can get a drink and enjoy the view
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,I recommend visiting Seven Mile Beach to see the great views but ultimately come back to the Reef for the evening sun and thier fun on the beach. You can visit seven mile and then find heaven on the EAST END.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Enjoy a wind down on Grand Cayman's seven mile beach with signature pinocoladas from the Ritz Carlton beach bar.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Great swimming beautiful scenery very relaxing time. Crystal clear water. Also very clean and plenty of shade as well would definitely go back anytime!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,I have been to this beach nine times now and it is the best beach on the island. White sand and beautiful water. I must to see
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,The most gorgeous beach I have ever seen!!! Clear waters and lots to do!!! I will be planning my next vacationon Seven Mile!!!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,It's in Georgetown and pretty much where all the action is for shopping eating tourist stuff since the airport is close and the cruise ships arrive here.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Seven Mile Beach is one of the best beaches I've been to. There are lots of activities or you can just relax on the beautiful sand. When I was there there was no problem at all finding a private spot on the sand. The water is so clear the diving and snorkeling is great!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Seven mile beach is the best beach I've ever been to hands down. The water is warm and clear the sand is soft and the sunsets are beautiful.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,very nice beach and the Ocean is clean and cool. Its a good place to take long walks and they are dog friendly.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We walked along this beach every morning of our week here and loved it! Beautiful white sand and blue green crystal clear water. It was fun looking for pieces of coral rocks and shells. Although this beach has very few shells and I only found a few really really small ones.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,The chairs rent for $5.00. I took my towel and had a good time. The water was very clear- they had the big blow up climbers see saws and all for kids to play on in areas picnic tables under shelters and rest rooms.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,This place is the amazing tropical beach you dream about. Gorgeous water white sands and plenty of adult beverages to keep you feeling good!

g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,No one ther during week days. Just wonder full We had the entire beach to ourselves. The best part of a not so hot time this trip
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,great sandy beach and great snorkeling just off the shore! the public areas are also well maintained.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,If you like to walk the beach this is the one for you. Yes it has been built up over the years but is still a super beach.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,The sand is just incredible! But the water is priceless. The colors the clarity perfect temperature. We had an amazing 6 days lounging on this beach. Definitely the beach to go to.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Favorite: Walking food tour of Georgetown which is an opportunity to hear about all things Cayman & sample great food! Did I mention rum cake?
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,All the beaches in this area are open to the public up to the high water line. This includes the area in front of the Govenor's House. They are very clean and beautiful white sand. One area does has outside showers to clean the sand from your feet.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,The water is always a nice temperature the snorkeling is fantastic and the weather is awesome. There are no predators to worry about when snorkeling. Swimming with the stingrays at Stingray City is a fantastic experience. Some of the best diving in the world can be experienced in the Caymans.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,my family and I went to the beach. The water was perfect. It was a perfect way to spend the day. Highly recommend.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,I'm from St Pete Florida so one could say I love a good beach. The sand if nice here and the water is calm. The space is limited and quite full with people which makes this beach less attractive than others in the world but hey it's a beach so enjoy!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,The beach was really nice at the Westin. Also went snorkeling two days in front of Governor's mansion right next door. While it wasn't one of the top snorkeling spots I have done it was decent especially considering it was free & right next to out hotel. Would be fine for kids or beginners.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,This is a beautiful clean beach. Morning walks are a must! The locals are friendly and want to see the visitors enjoy their stay on the island.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Relaxing Beach with clean turquoise waters .. Loves the public beach near governor's House .. One of the most beautiful beaches I have seen .
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Not the widest ( narrow in some places) but nice walk calm surf no peddlers very safe no over crowded  quite enjoyable
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Seven Mile Beach is beautiful white soft sand crystal clear warm water. There are vendors along the beach for sports activities- but the Ritz only services their guests so walk toward the Westin side.

g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Loved the clarity and newbie snorkeling when ocean was calm. Didn't like the lack of clean up of seaweed at our condo. Also came home with ear infection and swimmers ear. I have never had this before and blame it on trash in seaweed... Cruise boats?
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,One of the most beuatiful beaches in the caribbean! White powder sand and clear blue water. There are reefs within swimming distance to snorkle.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Pure crystal clear ocean. No one bothers you and it is so beautiful and serene. I recommend visiting the Cayman Islands
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Miles of the whitest sand & clearest blue water you'll find anywhere. Many of the hotels are located right on the Seven Mile Beach & for those who stay farther inland a Public Beach with cabanas restrooms & showers is available for use.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,The beach is long with beautiful white sand and crystal clear water. But if you want something less developed even more beautiful rent a vehicle and hit some of the desolate beaches on the eastern and northern parts of the island. Just drive around the ocean road and you will see them here and there. Plus some bars and restaurants.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,7 miles of beautiful white sand. Can't think of a better place to relax and people watch. Parasailing volleyball snorkeling or just lunch on the beach it is all there for you to enjoy
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We went to the public beach and Cemetery Reef - shopped in some of the strip malls along the way - it's just a fun relaxing time and great way to spend a day.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We loved that you can walk for miles on the beach…also Governors cove is very quiet and clean. We enjoyed the sunsets and the beautiful waves.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Never seen a beach like this. Clean long amazing blue waters. Lots of sports activities to undertake or just lying in the shade and taking in the vista. Drawbacks: We used a public part of the beach and the toilet was a portable loo. Not good. Also total lack of fresh water showers.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Amazing beach. Obviously you can walk as far as you like or up to 7 miles. 180 degrees of ocean viewing satisfaction. Impressive properties. Beach is very clean. Water is awesome and provides some great snorkelling. There are several public access points but try cemetery beach if you are unsure.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,

g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Destination spot for our cruise ship. Glad we didn't pay for the expensive excursion to bring us here because we simply stumbled upon the beach while walking around George Town; no admission fee necessary. Glad we stopped to enjoy this clean and beautiful beach but busy with tourists. Very good beach average experience.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,I have heard so many good things about 7-miles beach from friends and reviews on the internet so I have very high expectation from it. The 7-mile beach did not let me down. Stretching white sand and crystal clear water and beautiful blue sky 7-mile beach totally has me!!! I enjoyed every minute I spent there.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,If you like busy this is the place. Take out your wallet and leave it out you are going to need it a lot. Reminded me of Oahu. Don't get me wrong there is lots to do but busy especially when the cruise ships come in.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Loved these beaches....clean white sand and light turquoise water with zero entry. We sent to Governor's Beach and snorkeled then jet-skied and had lunch at the Westin next door. So much fun.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Seven Mile is the place to stay in Grand Cayman. The soft white sand and crystal-clear water is beautiful. There are many good restaurants and fun activities along Seven Mile.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,You should go if you are in Cayman as its the best beach there but is no where close to beaches in USVI or even Roatan.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,This is a beautiful spot on Grand Cayman. We enjoyed many amenities of The Westin while staying at Sunshine Suites Resort. Loved the water sports available through Red Sail Sports located at The Westin and other locations along the beach. Nice snorkeling off Governor's Beach. Nightly beautiful sunsets!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Not my favorite place in the Cayman but probably the most famous beach with most of the hotels and tourist activity on the island. But do not forget to go around the whole island there are other great beaches
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,clear watersoft sand which is ideal for sandcastles and modelling.Lots of water sports and things to do. The downside is that it is quite busy and probably difficult for people not staying in a hotel or condo on the beach to find a good place to sit.Walking at du sk and watching the sunset is wonderful!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We visited 7 Mile beach for a short time. The beach and water color are unbelieveable. We have our special places that we like and we stay in Bodden Town but I always need a little dose of 7 mile beach.

g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Everything is close to seven mile beach. And the best hotels and restaurants are there too. Very safe and also easy to take mini buses they pick you up on the side of the street.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,7 Mile is gorgeous. By far my favorite beach that I've seen so far. The water is crystal clear the sand white the waves not too large. Perfect for lounging around.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,staying at a hotel at the Seven Miles Beach was a big plus to our trip. This is great for an endless walk along the beach and blue water probably the clearest I have seen in my life

g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,This is the best beach i have every been to. There is no one to hagleing you like in mexico. Theres no signs throughout advertising things. But there are days a different locations where there are way too many crise ship people on the beach.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Seven Mile Beach is stunning! Among the very best we have travelled. Sections around the more popular hotels are very busy. Artificial reef balls in front of the Mariott are a great snorkel and easy walk down the beach to access. We prefer the quieter Treasure Island Beach where we stay. Water is warm and clear and shallow for kids.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,for $2.50 in each way grab the city bus and ask the bus driver to take you to a great beach. 7 mile beach was disappointing but our bus driver got us to a small remote beach that was perfect.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Gorgeous beach! Very clean and water is crystal clear. Plenty of beachside dining options up and down the beach. I recommend staying clear of Royal Palms beach when the cruise ships are in port. It tends to be very crowded with cruisers.

g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Picturesque sunsets watersports . beach bars and Pirate Divers couldnt as for more Calico Jacks the perfect after dive drink location and best sunset on the island. Even got a green flash
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,we spent 2 hours here we wished we had more time. There is a couple places that rent snorkel equipment & people said that there were a lot of pretty fish to see while snorkeling. They could use more options to clean sand off your feet & change but there is food & drink nearby as well as transportation.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Great beach for swimming or snorkeling. A must see while on the island. We spent almost every day on this beach at one point or the other.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Very nice beach but was not as great as I was expecting. I was little disappointed on the snorkeling off the beach think you need to do a boat trip. We had a great walk for the day.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Nice beach beautiful water that you can see all the way to the bottom. Lots of things to do here including eating drinking swimming and some people offering water sport excursions. It is THE beach in the Caymans for us tourist.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,you can walk and walk and walk great people watching and cute bars and restaurants along the way too
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,This is one of the most beautiful beaches I have visited! There are fantastic snorkelling sites and wonderful swimming.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Clean beach clear water calm waves water sports and no solicitation. What more could you ask for? The beach in front of the Westin is one of the nicest by far!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Just lovely. Deserted and beautiful waters. had plenty of places to buy drinks or rent paddle boards from too
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,This is one of the most pristine beaches you'll ever see the water clarity is superb and the sand is terrific too!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We snorkeled in late afternoon directly behind a cemetery beach was beautiful. Showers made it a bit too dark but next time we'll go earlier in the day.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,The beaches are beautiful. Although we stayed on the opposite side of the island we drove to 7-mile beach 12 out of 14 days because it was a great place to relax and swim. Our favorite beach on Seven Mile was Public Beach followed by Governors Beach.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,The sand on this beach is powder soft. Water is an amazing aqua and very warm and calm. Just loved it here.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Great place to take long Walks and swim. Easy to get away from crowds. The locals made us neat grass hats. Many places close to the beach for drinks and food.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,very nice walk on one of the best beaches in the world. We have stopped for a beer at the cayman jack but was a bit busy with the cruse line.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,... in a safe clean environment with excellent food right across the street (in most parts). Seven Mile Beach has to be one of the top beaches in the World.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,My wife asked me how high Seven Mile beach ranks on the World's Best Beaches list? I have no idea about the list but I do know that 7 mile Beach is perhaps one of most beautiful anywhere.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,perfect way to spend the day. white sand clear blue waters and excellent snorkeling. Saw 2 spotted eagle rays the last time I snorkeled at Governor's Beach.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,7 mile beach is fairly close to town. we went there with several families. there is food and drink located right on the beach. Good times...
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Great beach to relax or take a walk or snorkel. It's beautiful and peaceful here! A must place to see in Grand Cayman!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We keep coming back as it is a great place to have both a vacation and access diving spots. Finally found a great place Cayman Diving School (not to be confused with Cayman Diving College which isn't as good). Whatever the case you will love coming here and the beach and sand are amazing!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,This was my second time to visit and both experiences were awesome! I love how it's February and I was able to soak up the sun and get in the water. This beach is absolutely perfect. I laid on my lounge chair and dreamed about moving there. Maybe one day.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,I love Seven Mile Beach :) It's beautiful peaceful and fun. There a few great bars dotted along the shore. The water is always crystal clear and seems to bring out the best in people. One of the top beaches in the Caribbean... if not the world!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,It is rated one of the world's most beautiful beaches...and it is. It will meet your expectations even if you are picky. Not crowded soft white sand easy in & out of the water usually calm water and the color of the ocean is most amazing:0
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,This beach offers something for everyone. We went on our first scuba dive and loved it! We watched the sunset with champagne.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,one of the cleanest beaches. the water was very clear you can see the fish. the fish are friendly and will come to the shore to greet you.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,7 Mile beach is not to be missed! It is miles and miles of white sand and beautiful water! There are no private beaches in Cayman so you can walk the entire length. Plenty of nice places to eat and drink along the way.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Great sand awesome water snorkelling options sun loungers can be hired along with umbrellas. We just made sandcastles and Collected coral pieces.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,The pictures don't do this place justice! It seems like the govt does not stop picking up debris cleaning the beach and making sure its safe.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,One of the prettiest and cleanist beaches I've visited and I've been round the world. We're talking white sand crystal clean aqua water and snorkeling reefs 50 years from shore. Just wow. Great restaurants and hotels as well.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Grand Cayman is famous for its lovely beaches and Seven Mile Beach is one of its loveliest! I have been to several beaches along the 6+ miles and they are all beautiful. Some areas are quiet and others are more party atmosphere. There is something for everyone!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,You can go anywhere on Seven Mile Beach to have clear smooth almost like a pool water and white sand beaches. The only bad thing this is it can get hot without trees or an umbrella but then you just jump in the water
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Beautiful stretch of beach and lovely reefs for diving or snorkeling. The area can varying along sections of the beach depending on where you walk to. No complaints when I have sand under my feet with exotic scenery around.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,One of the best beaches in the western Caribbean It is really great for snorkeling diving swimming and all water sports.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,One of the best sandy beaches with great snorkeling and diving. I just wish there were less condos and hotels on it but at least not to many high rises.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,what a shame that this strip of beautiful beach has become a complete lookalike of many resort towns-masses of hotels chain restaurants shops and nothing special
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,You can walk swim snorkel dive whatever you want and it is perfect. Great sunsets many different places/hotels to stop and have a drink. You can walk as far and as long as you want. There is no comparison to any of the beaches I have been to besides Hawaii.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,The beach is well maintained provides a good place to walk jog run with several miles of unintertuppted sand. The island curves so the water changes along the coast from how rough it is or isn't. There are reefs close to the short allowing snorkeling right off the beach in a few places.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,beautiful clean beach with fine sand some rocks in first few feet of water great for water activities
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,If you are looking for that perfectly turquoise water and a white sand beach this is the place for you. Walk along the beach and you will come across quiets area sports centers high end restaurants to small beach cafés. It is definitely worth a visit and we spent a week here and would still come back
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Great sunsets nice sand quiet and low key just by getting a short distance north. Someone found a treasure coin week we were there that the high winds week before may have washed in!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Other than some drop offs- we spent a lot of time at Cemetary beacg to snorkel and it was a lot of fun- and on the right days- lots of fish!! Bring your own stuff on that end of the beach as not any amenities
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Nice maintained beach and surprisingly not that crowded. I like Seven Mile Beach because there are no beggars or people coming up to you to sell you things like at other resort beaches.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,This is a wonderful beach. The entire length of the beach was beautiful. Plenty of great properties all with dining very close.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Seven Mile beach is about 20-30 feet wide. What a disappoinment. Although the sand is nice and the water looks pretty I expected more. Too many other places with wide beautiful beaches so I would never go back.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Wonderful just wonderful! The seven mile beach is gorgeous. White coral beach with blue warm water. I have visited the Island in mars April August September and in December and it is always warm and enjoyable.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,After spending the morning at stingray city- the tour company dropped us at 7 mile beach for the afternoon. We had a wonderful lunch on the beach and then spent the afternoon strolling the beach and swimming. It was wonderful! We were there in April 2012
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Great sand. A bit crowdy at christmas but not a mess. Hard to play in the water due to fast declining.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,we stayed right by Seven Mile Beach although on the first day a lot of seaweed was washed up it was cleared away very quickly and the lovely white sands restored. We had a lovely walk along the beach on our last morning such a beautiful place
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,The sea can change dramatically from one day to the next. Unless you are a strong swimmer DO NOT go too far without a life support of some kind. A beautiful beach with the clearest water in the world and in good weather usually no problems.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,The calm blue waters welcome all types of visitors. Snorkeling off the beach is amazing and relaxing. No crowded excursions! Just walk right out and swim. You can walk for hours and not be bothered!!!!! Beautiful and clean beach that makes me continue to return. Turks and Caicos would be a very close second!!!!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,The beach is beautiful and the water is a clear turquoise blue. If you visit Grand Cayman you definitely want to see this stretch of sand.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Lots of great place for snorkeling and swimming all along this beach. Loved the daily walks up and down it.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Beautiful white sandy beach. Multiple choices of restaurants and bars to drink and dine. So many choices and not enough to do them all!!!!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,It seems strange to have to pay $30 for a chair on the beach empty bars and empty chairs. Guess everyone needs to make a living . The view was pretty  the beach drops off pretty quickly. Beers are expensive.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Simply a great beach for walking and swimming. Stunning water clarity...goes on for five or six miles. No venders hassle you. I usually don't like beaches where there are lots of hotels but this one is different.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,You will love this location and the area around it. So much to do and so beautiful! You can do a trip from your cruise ship or on your own in town. You will need to take a bus or taxi to get there.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,This beach has access all over and in many areas the reefs are just off shore. Depending on where you go you may be one of only a few people occupying that area.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,

g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Governor's beach Cemetery Beach public beach farther out. All not overcrowded and warm and welcoming. Swimming hanging out snorkeling. All Good.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Very crowded and not welcoming to those not staying at one of the resorts crammed together plus with all the cruise ships in port (up to 6 at a time) the area gets too congested.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,What is there not to like Easy free parking hot sunshine with a cooling breeze fine soft sand warm water good snorkelling just 200 meters off-shore and some high quality food and drink at the back of the beach. Westin beach bar is not cheap but the quality and service is super
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,visted grand cayman for the day while on a cruise. Got a taxi at port up to 7 mile beach. Absolutely beautiful with pristine white sand. Immaculately clean. Just beautiful!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,This is a beautiful beach but no real public spot to just hang out and sunbathe. There are all condos and resorts all along beach. But do check it out. Water is gorgeous and sand is awesome. We walked along the beach and just put a towel down anyway
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Wonderful safe feeling beach with nominal access fee. Food quite high as expected for the Island. The hamburger was quite delicious though. Wonderful fish to be seen in the surf. Plentiful corals and mosses.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,My favorite stop of a Caribbean cruise I can't wait to come back here for a week! Beautiful sandy beach with calm waters perfect weather great accommodation and eatery choices wonderful snorkeling (on the other side of the island)...all in all as good as it gets for a beach get-away.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Beautiful long strand; limpid 83 degree water Completely full of resorts and condominiums but there are also public beaches and access for all.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Wife and i walked in the morning before breakfast it was beautiful before all the people show up. Gets a little crowded this month with the holidays but get there early and stake your spot. would recomend swim shoes here the bottom is a little rough.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Took taxi from port. Found out later you can walk from port to a free beach access just pass cemetery. Nice beach but watch for over pricing. Example beach chairs ranged from $7-$30. We ended up going down beach beyond the crowd resorts & lounge chairs. Private & much better snorkeling.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,A beautiful beach (actually 5 1/2 miles long). Lots of hotels beach bars condo's. Wonderful sunsets swimming & walking. Bliss
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,The best place to snorkel is either by Tiki Beach or by The Christopher Columbus/The Anchorage hotels. The beach is clean and during the off season it feels as if you have the beach to yourself at times.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Beautiful aqua waters soft sand very clear. Too built up too many hotels too many people. Great if you don't mind the crowds jet skis etc. I like to read and veg out. Very developed for my taste
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Spend the day at this part of the seven mile beach soaking up some sun at Calico Jack's. Great view great atmosphere and great location. Food was very good too.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,The clearest tropical waters I've ever seen no seaweed anywhere in sight! A must see if you visit Cayman Islands.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,I advise to walk the entire beach...best spot in west bay marine park where is less populated and snorkeling gives chances to have interesting meetings
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,I would advise to walk along the entire beach. Best spot in west bay at marine park with shipwreck and chances to meet turtles
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Its been decades since we have visited and I am happy that there are still bits of private pristine beaches along the stretch of white sand. The water is unlike any other in the Caribbean!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,It is a spotlessly clean pure white smooth sand - you can walk for miles on this sand. There are various places where you can hire a jet ski or paddle board.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Clean White powder sand beach Clear blue waters the most amazing fish and reefs…there simply is nowhere more beautiful more peaceful in the world than Seven Mile Beach Grand Cayman. So much so that I choose to live here.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,one can actually walk for miles along the water's edge and pass by different hotels. white clean sand and clearest water.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We ended up here because Sting ray City was closed due to wind. Nice beach sand and calm waters. Good for a calm beach day. Drinks were just ok at Surfside food just ok too.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Our bag with camera and tablet was stolen from the beach chair. The beach otherwise is nice and beautiful. Lack of security is what it makes it dangerous for tourists.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Not much to dislike here- the sand is powdery soft and the water calm and deliciously warm...Never has it been too crowded to appreciate good snorkeling here with stingrays and turtles and such. Must go!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,The beach was wonderful - great for both exercise and relaxation. We could snorkel right in front of our resort
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,You will not be disappointed with the clear turquoise waters and white sand of Seven Mile Beach. Many well travelled Caribbean enthusiasts will tell you that it's one of the finest beaches in the world - and it is!!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Once you've been to SMB no other beach will be quite as good! Clear blue sea loads of fish white soft sand. Perfect for snorkelling swimming getting some rays.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We have been coming to seen mile beach for the last twenty years. Great family vacation the beach is exceptional good restaurants and. Very safe place.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Seven mile Beach is one of the most beautiful places in the Caribbean. It is quite the hotel are well kept and upgraded. The Beaches are clean and well maintained.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,I haven't been to many beaches in the Caribbean but 7-mile is very nice with calm water and white sand. That being said it is mostly built up with not much natural beauty on the shoreline. With Cayman's flat topography I can imagine there are more beautiful natural beaches elsewhere..
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Water was very clear and not rocky. Beach was clean. Had to take a cab there because it was more than a couple miles from town.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Went here for my anniversary back in 2008 and it was tremendous. The Water was green/blue and it was warm.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,The water is perfectly clear most of the time the sand is white-to-whitish-pink...still one of the best beaches anywhere.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Very clear and great water. A nice relaxing beach to go to rather its just for swimming or chilling.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Amazing beach. Tons of places to snorkel. Warm water? Lots of water activities available. Lots of places to stop and visit

g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Seven Mile Beach is the main beach strip on the island. This is a great spot to hang out with the family for the day - there is no food or drinks available so be sure to bring snacks and drinks with you
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Really enjoyed the beach and the water. Well worth doing but I think I'd pick a different hotel next time as the concierge was VERY condescending about our "casual attire" for dinner out. :(
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Great beach. Crystal clear water and nice white sand. Great place for snorkeling or diving. Not sure what else to say its a beach
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,I tend to stay on the East End but 7 Mile leaves nothing to be desired. The beaches and bars are quite amazing and the people are friendly as well. Cayman is lucky to have such diversity in such a small space.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Pristine beach with white sand and beautiful crystal clear blue water and no crazy crowds to boot. What more can one ask for in a vacation?! I didn't want to leave.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Even though we weren't staying on Seven Mile Beach we really enjoyed walking along the white sands. We were here the week after Christmas week and did not find the beach to be all that busy or congested. The hotels and condos were beautiful and the water warm and clear.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,The water is quite possibly the clearest I've ever seen. Lots of sea life to check out while snorkeling. The sand is gorgeous and the area never really feels crowded.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We pulled into one of the public places to park and took a swim and watched the sunset. Nice sandy beach that's seven miles long. Take a walk bring your dog people watch and enjoy the ocean. Bring a cooler and have a picnic. A great day at the beach for the whole family.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,off the cruise ship and on a tour of the town was great and stopping here for 3 hours was just what i needed to relax and work on my tan. loved the 10.00 beach chairs and 12.00 unbrellas. Smoothies and sandwiches were great. my friend and I shared. good time and relaxing......
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Long beautiful beach on West End. Avoid the resorts and condos and look for public sections on North End especially small section near Governors Residence.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,The beach is actually 5 1/2 miles long but it is very narrow. The sand is nice the orientation is great there are slides and swings for kids and the water is so warm. Also great for swimming.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,My daughter and I walked a long way from the Marriott to past the Harbor House. It was a very beautiful walk. Lots to do along the Beach. We stayed at the Marriott and my wife daughter and I loved it there.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,The most spectacular beach that we have traveled to. We have been all over the world and this is our favorite place.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Seven Mile Beach is beautiful. My family and I enjoyed every moment of it. From relaxing to riding the wave runner it was a blast and I can't wait until I walk on that sand again.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Checked out different areas of the beach you definitely want to be near Sunshine Suites or the Westin NOT near the Marriott. The beach area near the Marriott is much narrower.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Clean beachclean water; we were in the ocean to our upper chest and could still see our toes! Gotta love that Carribean Sea!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,It is a beautiful beach with miles of white sand and pristine water. Food and drinks available for purchase. Perfect place to relax!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,One of the better beaches to visit when on the island. Miles of white sand and some water sport activities available in certain stretches of the beach.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,It is a beautiful beach with calm aqua water. Great for swimming and long walks. Don't miss the sunset- its awesome
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,If you're staying somewhere other than Seven Mile Beach you can still enjoy this area if you park at a public beach. Governor's Beach is located just north of the Westin. Lotsa shade for parking and resting when you're not in the water. Another public beach just .25 mile north of Governor's Beach has bathrooms showers and shaded bench areas.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Grab a taxi when you get off cruise ship$5-3bucks one way. Low price entry fee onto the beach. We stopped at the first hotel beach access. Crowded but lovely. Resturant / bar is pricey.beer is as much as the cruise ship. Food tasty but high.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Prior to my trips I always research the area I will be visiting. When researching The Grand Caymans the info suggests that Seven Mile Beach is one of the best. It absolutely is. Some of the finest sand and cleanest beach I've visited in the Caribbean. Definitely hit Seven Mile Beach.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Seven mile beach is clean safe and beautiful! Caribbean clear blue water and soft white sand! The best part is the tree lined beach where you can lay a towel or blanket and feel the vibe of the island! Don't forget your caybrew local beer:)
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Great beach but everything too expensive and not a full seven miles. Feel cheated. Food too expensive fee to use attractions - surprised they do not charge to get into ocean.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Nice and clean golden sand turquoise ocean. Beautiful. Several nice restaurants and good hotels. Great place to go. The public beach areas have toilets and places to change. Also they have covered seats to sit down if you get too hot.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Growing up in a beautiful beach city created high standards in my head but nothing prepared me for the beauty of Seven Mile Beach. Crystal clear turquoise water filled with colorful fish that swim by you all day and clear skies with a beautiful star filled panorama during the night.. Go to Cayman Islands!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Certainly one of the most beautiful beaches on the planet the water is like none other the sand is lovely you can walk out a long ways and the water is shallow and warm. Absolutely breathtaking.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,With a short swim off the beach there is some really great snorkeling with lots of varying fish and many eagle rays. It's also a great spot to learn how to paddleboard because it's so calm most of the time. Water was very warm and crystal clear. Beautiful sunsets.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,The beach was clean and well maintained and the water was crystal clear!! There were even trees if you wanted to sit in the shade.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,So pretty! We took the public bus for 2.50 a person (each way) from the dock when we got off the cruise ship. So we paid $10 total for the two of us to relax on beautiful seven mile beach instead of the crazy rates the cruise ship charges for excursions.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,I really enjoyed the Seven Mile Beaches especially after 3pm. When all the daily cruise ship visitors return the beach was serene and open for play.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We had most of seven mile beach to ourselves and about 5 other couples all week. The water was perfect beautiful blues very clear
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,The sand is soft and the water is clear what more could you ask for? Get up early to catch a glimpse of some rays floating around and bring a snorkel mask to peek at some fish as they swim on by.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,A key stopover for Cruise Ships (Carnival Royal Caribbean etc.) easy access lots of places to shop lay out terrific snorkeling places with sunken ships and lots of coral reefs and fish! Locals are friendly but not pushy a great place to have fun and relax!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,this stretch of shore has some beautiful beaches and that are very conveinient when needing facilities etc!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,One of the best beaches I've had the pleasure of visiting. The water is clean with some of the softest sand. A great place for walks sunbathing and enjoying some time in the water.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,The water is crystal clear. The sand is soft. The beach is as calm as a lake with no waves. The area is really clean and there is no harassing people trying to sell things on the beach. A most to see if you visit the Cayman Island.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,the best beach visited  white sand and transparent warm water with a lot of fish Great tiki bar at entrance
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,This is a beautiful stretch of beach. Lots of recreational choices and it was safe for the entire family. I would recommend this beach to anyone.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Best beach in Cayman. Super clean and the water is beautiful. Will go again and again. I want to move here
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We stayed at the westin on 7 mile beach and the beach is always nice and has plenty of places to snokle and rent things if you want
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,You want to relax in a super clear warm not crowded beach......this is it. You can stay for hours just floating in this water. Fish just swim by and sometimes even a lobster will walk close by....it is paradise!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,This beach does not have a large distance between the water's edge and grassy area near the road but the water is wonderful.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,The water here is spectacular. Calm and just the right temperature. It's also clean and you can see to the bottom. I love that I'm also actually swimming in a live ecosystem. The fish are all around!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Really best water I've ever been in. Warm clear beautiful color... and soft sand! Reefs not too far off the beach so easy to snorkle right from shore. Terrific!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We stayed on 7 mile beach on our vacation. The sand is perfect and the water is crystal clear. The only drawback is the width of the beach is fairly narrow since Hurrican Ivan came through. It is recovering slowly but just be aware that you may have close-quarters in your area.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,80+ foot visibility clear turquoise waters gentle surf 80 degrees year round and white sandy beaches! Best in the world!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,This beach is rated top 30 in the world. There is a reason. The beach and water are like what you dream of when you think of paradise.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Loved Grand Cayman - Seven Mile Beach. It's beautiful! White sand beautiful water. Great for snorkling. Would definitely return. Beware for a family it is very expensive to eat and drink all week. Don't think there are any all-inclusive resorts on the island.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,The beach can't be beat. It's too bad the major hotel chains have access to the beach blocked. FYI - all beaches in Grand Cayman are public. NO hotel owns the beach. They do however can own the land up to the beach and therefore block your access to the public beach - sucks really.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,There are a lot of things to do on Seven Mile beach. We have rented a car and driven all over the island but there really isn't a whole lot to do the further you get away. You are close to the turtle farm Georgetown and all the good restaurants.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We stayed much further down the island and loved it. Seven Mile Beach was nice for a stroll but if you are more interested in a private vacation Bodden Town was great! We really enjoyed being off the "main" stretech.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Not the place for the photo of the isolated hammock and palm tree. Caribbean water was all of 10-12 feet from the cement pool deck at our place but I'm told other such beaches exists around the island. The water was beautiful however.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,I live and work in Georgetown Grand Cayman. I have a condo facing the beach close to Treasure Island resort and the Westin Casuarina.The beaches are gorgeous and clean. 7 mile beach is the place to visit. Beach after beach after beach. All nice restaurants and bar nearby too and so as grocery.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Frequently go to Florida gulf coast. Have vacationed in Malaysia Thailand Rocky Mountains Alaska and more. 7-Mile beach is our favorite. Not for active youth good for small kids and couples.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,I loves the beaches on 7 miles. We had a great time. Our tour guide did a great job. Love the free chairs and umbrella. The cost of the jet ski rental was very cheap $50.00 for two riders.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,When seeing 7 mile beach.....see 7 mile beach. Travel the whole beach. There are many beach access points so do yourself a favor travel to different areas of the beach. Every one has it's own flavor and sites. Amazing how the water and sites may differ in is little as a half mile.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,When we visited Seven Mile Beach we rented a Cabana at the Royal Palms. You got 4 beach chairs and a covered table with 4 chairs for dining on the beach. You also had a server to get you drinks so you did not have to go up the bar. I have never seen sand so white.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We were at the Marriott during slow season so we had some room to move. There is not much sand and it is filled with chairs so don't plan on building a castle. It is amazing to walk down the beach and if it was not for size it would have been perfect.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,nice refreshing clear water... not terribly busy even on a Sunday (but it wasn't high season) beautiful sunsets... if there is a nicer beach I haven't visited it yet.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,A beautiful stretch of beach. Clean and filled with very friendly people! Walking down towards Georgetown was fine and hoping a bus for the quick trip was even better. Taxi's were a rip off and riding the buses you got to meet locals.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Seven Mile Beach is just that one of the longest stretches of beaches in the Caribbean . Local beach bar Calico Jack's is always fun during their Full Moon Party. Go by and enjoy the sun and fun and then stop in for drink and snack.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Just pay $4/pp (one way) for shuttle to get to the beach from the cruise terminal. We paid $10 for 2 beach chairs and $4 for umbrella. We ordered foods and drinks from the bar by the beach and get free wifi. The beach is quite clean and sandy definitely a safe place for family.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Can't beat the calm warm water of the Caribbean. Stayed on the beach all day. Mostly families and kids there very comfortable for those without Venice beach bodies.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Seven mile beach is a fantastic play to relax and play. Love the cafes and fantastic flat water (most of the time).
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,One of the most beautiful beaches in the world. Relax swim in the ocean go to a beach bar. What can be better than that??
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,probably one of the best beaches i've ever seen. Clear clean water fishes swim right up by your feet wonderful environment
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Great stretch of beach. We stayed at the Marriott and walked in both directions for a few miles. Amazing!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,The beach was beautiful and clean! The water was clear and the most beautiful shades of aqua green and blue.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Liked everthing. The water is warm  the sand is white .This beach is well kept! There are bathroom facilities and Calico Jacks serves drinks and food on the beach.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,The water here is very calm perfect for just floating around paddle boarding lots of great snorkeling.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Very long beach wide lots of area's to swim and lots of sand. Local fish may swim very close to you which is thrilling for the young ones.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We rented clear kayaks and paddled around for a couple hours. Water was crystal clear and warm. We were able to see some pretty neat sea life since the beach wasn't to crowded. Plenty of bars and restaurants around when you need something to eat.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Crystal clear waters and soft clean sand. Calm waters (barely any waves much of the year). Close to everything. Safe and beautiful.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,So big and clean plenty of space never crowded with on or near the beach with easy access to restrooms shade and eating and drinking facilities.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,London House was awesome great staff easy access to everything and the beach was outstanding!!!!!!!!!!!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,The staff is very supportive and highly professional. Ms. Miller really took care of us along with her staff the entire visit. Thanks Grand Beach for the magnificent stay.....
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Although I must admit I've never visited a beach I didn't love this beach is among my favorites. The water is crystal clear and you can see the ocean floor well out into the water. The sand is white. The beach is kept clean. I never saw discarded trash.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We stayed on 7 Mile Beach and it was some of the best snorkeling. There are man made coral pot reefs (they look like pots with holes in them) and the marine life in and around the reef will keep you in the water for hours.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,What more do you need? This beach is amazing!!! 50 characters simply not needed. Best sand best calm waters best fish.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Beautiful beaches and great part of town. Probably one of the best parts of Grand Cayman. Georgetown was dead on a Saturday night we when visited came back to SMB and it was lively especially at the Sunshine Suites.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Even at peak season this beach does not seem crowded. The sand is white the water is clear and you can walk for miles down the public beach.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,I love Grand cayman and this beach. Beautiful long beach great water activities calm waters nice people very safe. The water is great for swimming in. Thoroughly enjoyed myself
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Love this beach...every part of it. Sandy oasis and not overly crowded with people. Lots of things to see and do or just sit and watch the beautiful ocean.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,This is my favorite chill spot on the island. Nothing can compare to how beautiful this beach is!!!!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Food was slow and expensive. Water was murky and we couldn't see to snorkel at all at least from the beach. Plus this excursion required tenders to take us to and from the boat and that took freaking forever!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Soft white sand clear turquoise water big blue sky warm breezes!!! All you need now is a beach chair and a good book!! Seven Mile beach has it all and its no wonder its rated one of the most beautiful beaches!!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,This is a wonderful beach for the visitor to the Caribbean to experience. It offers water sports quiet spots people spots you name it. Try staying at a hotel such as Comfort Suites not on the beach but very close and for a great value.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,seems most there is to do with shopping eating night life accommodations are all available along Seven Mile. which is ok. much of east end of island is open with resorts restaurants just along the coast with the beaches.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,very fine white sand - pristine beach. Picture perfect and lovely. Although we did not stay long on the beach because it was part of a larger excursion it was wonderful. I would have loved to linger and walk along the turquoise waters of Grand Cayman.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,...stayed at the Westin...center of Seven Mile Beach...loved it!! absolutely gorgeous view any time of day!! Spotted Eagle rays just off of shore but not close enough for younger kids to encounter without swimming a ways out...absolutely breathtaking!!!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Wonderful atmosphere and service. Great Beach! Would go back in a heart beat. Plan to stay longer next time.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Great value in staying on Seven Mile Beach while you're on the island!! Crystal clear water and great snorkeling right at the beach....saw eagle rays off the beach regularly!!!! Lots of bright fish and pretty shells and corals!!!!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Gorgeous white sand clean and not crowded. Nice for couples and families. Crystal clear blue water!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,If you like snorkeling or swimming in the ocean it is hard to beat Seven Mile Beach. The clear and calm water makes it ideal for swimming. Enjoy!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Wow the beauty of this beach the transparent waters where you can see your feet fish swimming with you and the most polite and sweet people all cannot compare with any other beaches I have seen.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,When visiting the caymans staying on seven mile is a must. You can walk out to one of the calmest most beautiful Caribbean beaches from your doorstep.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Simply stunning clean and 7 mile of beautiful beach! Stay on one of the beach front hotels and you wont be disappointed!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We had a short visit but the clear blue water was the main attraction. I would like to come back and stay longer.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Lots of coral/reef to snorkel by your hotel. You can walk up and down to other areas see different bars/eateries. Water is usually clear blue sometimes a teeny but murky.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,The water is so clean and so clear. It was actually like swimming in a swimming pool. There is even shade trees on the beach in several locations. Loved it!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,I love everything about this beach! It's clean & pristine. Crystal clear water sugary white sand and little/no issues with the current.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,May be the most beautiful beach in the Caribbean. Soft white sand and the clearest water anywhere. If you want to relax this is the place for you. Gorgeous sunsets.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,You can step in just a few feet and be swimming in a school of fish! Very clear warm water and the sand is super soft. The fish here aren't that colorful but they are plentiful. (I am talking about the area in front of the Marriott.) Gorgeous sunsets.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,gorgeous sand clear waters. great hotels on the beach near town on two ends and its only 5 miles...
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,A great beach to walk and maybe grab a drink along the way. It is an unspoiled and mostly uncommercialized beach of great beauty.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We stayed on the beach (Marriott). We walked down the beach doing a 'beach bar crawl'. We got as far as the Ritz and met up with a big storm? It was so much fun and we enjoyed ourselves immensely!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Beautiful short beach. Gorgeous green water. No natural shade though umbrellas can be rented. This is a favorite with the cruise ship guests. We prefer the smaller crowds more amenities and natural shade (palm trees and evergreens) of Rum Point but is a nice beach if you are on the west side of the island..
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,The snorkeling was awesome right in front of our condo. We enjoyed the sunsets on our deck and were able to walk to stores restaurants and excursions! Great location on Grand Cayman.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Walked Seven Mile Beach (seriously walked it for a couple of hours). The water was beautiful and the sand was so soft. But I couldn't wait to get back to the East End.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,great beach some snorkel spots perfect temperature water and nice sandy bottom beach at the Westin was very nice and spacious
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,OMG the colors are so beautiful... This is like paradise... And the best part is no sellers around. We going to be there again
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,A lovely beach it looks just like the photos. It's a great place to watch the sunset and there are plenty of places to sit without feeling like you are encroaching onto hotel space.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Everybody dreams the iconic white beach wth the deep thin sand . An in grand Cayman you have it. But i cannot apreciate it with the colssal condominiums and hotels.Sorry i prefer Maldives or even Grand Turk.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,One of my favorite places on the planet - serene beauty still not too touristy amazing views wonderful weather warm water sunsets to die for....we have been around the world and been on beaches in Fiji Australia East and west coast...and nothing compares to this stretch of sand...
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,It is clean and beautiful - clear waters as far as you can see. Many beach areas to relax have lunch or swim.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,You expect nothing less than perfect here and you will not be disappointed. The sand is power condition and the water is a clear to the bottom. We stayed in the resort there which provide the chairs the towels and refreshments.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Though we didn't stay at Seven Mile Beach we did visit late one day. Most of the beach is reserved for the hotel patrons but you can set up nicely at the public beach by the Governors House at the North end. A great place to do nothing all day.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,clear water soft clean sand for miles..on the beach and in the water. we walked and walked. Loved it.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,we visited a public beach... it was great! the water was beautiful and there are places that rent water type activities.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Big waves small hilly beach nothing interesting for snorkeling. I guess we were not lucky with the weather on SMB because East End was beautiful...
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,White cool sand underfoot calm waters good snorkeling mostly uncrowded good for walking and scenic. Has everything a beach should be in the tropics.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,This beach is simply the absolute best I have ever been to. Compared to Hawaii and California there is no competition. The white sand. Turquoise blue see through water. Calm. Uncrowded. Simply the best.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,

g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Beautiful gorgeous pplace the beach is a fantastic the water is turquoise blue and warm boutiques and restaurant near by super elegant and fun to visit
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,On Seven Mile Beach this little section of the west coast is a gem of a beach! Great place to snorkel!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Great beaches carribean club is first class weather not too hot. People and restaurants very good ...
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Soft white sand gorgeous turquoise water fantastic sunsets! Best beach on Grand Cayman & possibly anywhere.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Seven Mile Beach was a gorgeous beach and the water clear as a swimming pool! We did not stay here but chose to stay on the other side where it was quiet and tropical--Rum Point. It was the best for us.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Beautiful Island beautiful beach great place to vacation. Very clean and safe with plenty to do and see.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We had heard about this fantastic World Famous Seven Mile for years and we're not sure what the hype is all about. It is a nice beach but we collectively agreed that the beach in St. Pete's Florida is better.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We only went to seven mile to swim. The water is incredible. You can just lay on your back and float you don't even have to kick your arms or legs.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Seven Mile beach is the biggest and best beach on Grand Cayman. It has everything anyone could want -- stand up paddleboards jetskis sailboats parasailing tubing helicopter sightseeing and miles of white sand backed by bars and restaurants to suit every taste.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Everything you read is true...all the hype is true even if it is a tad over-commercialized these days.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Not what I came to the islands to experience. In fact I came to the islands to escape this. Do yourself a favor and find a beach as far away from this end of the island as is possible. You will be very happy you did.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Great beach for running or walking because of the hard packed sand. The water is crystal clear and refreshing. Great snorkeling in front of the Marriott. If you are patient and move away from the crowds you may see cuttlefish and spiny lobsters.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,The beach is lovely but crowded with many hotels right on the beach. It seemed relatively safe and it is easy to rent snorkeling equipment kayaks and cat boats. Walking the beach and people watching is fun.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Beautiful beach. it can get very crowded tho in the touristy seasons... so be sure to get there early. Lots to do see and the beach sand is very lovely
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,this is a great beach the sand is super soft and theaqua water super warm. You can walk to all of the major hotels within minutes yet it is not crowded. I'm not a beach person but this might convert me.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Five miles of white sands green-blue water no vendors reasonable crowds water temperature ranges from 78-84 degrees all year.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Cant say too much. Great beach great snorkeling right off shore. Never windy and too many activities to mention.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Loved all the white sand and aqua blue water. Snorkeled and swam along the 7 Mile Beach. Also lots of wonderful restaurants to check out. The nightlife is quite enjoyable. We saw Hi Tide at one of the restaurants. They had an all you can eat lobster night. My husband was in heaven.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We walked many miles of the Seven mile beach which is actually 5 1/2 miles. We didn't like the section between Tiki beach and Governors beach which we thought were rocky and crowded. We loved the beach around Camana bay which is all sand not crowded and clean.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Great place for water sports or taking in the rays. Water perfect temperature and beaches clean. Water is calm.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We've been to many Caribbean beaches but this one is our favorite. Never hassled by peddlers. Not too crowded. Beautiful water and clean sand. Plus it goes on and on and on.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,The best beach in the world. Amazing white sandy beach and turquoise blue shallow water suitable for all.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,The beach is soft sand easy snorkeling lots of bars and restaurants nearby. The water is clear and clean; lots of small fish to see along the shore. Very calm and easy swimming for family and small kids.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We went to seven mile a great deal but we always went back to a section on Governor's Beach. The section is just next to the Governor's home. If you are looking for a nice pace to relax this is the place. Go further up the beach either way and there is activity.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Spend the day on beautiful Seven Mile Beach where the sand is white and the water is clear and warm. Great scenery. Watch the cruise ships come and go. See the sailboats drift by. Read relax and enjoy!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Third time in Grand Cayman staying with our family who live in SMB. Love Royal Palms - walk further along to the right to get a much quieter experience. Go back for cocktails at sunset!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We just walked in through public access and set up our stuff and had fun snorkeling and sunning ourselves. Even though we could see many people the beach is so big there was ample room for all. Viva SMB we will be back soon!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,The beach is beautiful. White sands blue clear waters not too crowded. We watched the sunset one evening and it was beautiful.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Absolutely stunning and beautiful. Even though the weather was as nice as we were hoping this beach was unreal probably one of the nicest beaches we have ever visited in the world.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Beautiful beach! (Except in front of the Marriott). Very very crowded in front of the Marriott. However Can walk for miles along the beautiful clear water!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Gorgeous white sand stretching for miles warm turquoise water the sound of gently crashing waves incredible snorkeling sites right from the beach beautiful sunsets - couldn't ask for anything more.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Beautiful beach... tons of people. If you are looking to get away from people this is not the place to come.. particularly when a cruise ship is in port.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,The water feels like you are swimming in Evian water . I'm not sure if it's the minerals  or what..
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Great variety of beach. Perfect for swimming walking shelling and snorkelling. Safe police keep motorized things outside 200 feet from shorethey are on Jetskis! Lots of coral close toshore in spots gives kids places to search for critters. Lots of places for refreshments. Areas with crowds areas with nobody. Good eye candy provided by European cruise passengers.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Walking running snorkeling gazing napping reading...it is Seven Mile Beach and what the doctor ordered.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Excellent! Only down side was having to buy beach chairs. However I know it's pretty standard in the Caribbean. Water was crystal clear and comfortably warm (not too warm-still cooled you off for July heat). The sand was hot but again it was July.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,It’s nice that there’s a large parking lot available across the street and public restroom facilities. The beach was ok but still too many people for our liking. Try Cemetery Beach instead (just a bit more north but no bathrooms).
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Like Kenny Chesney says: "No shirt no shoes no problems and a drink in my hand with no bottom..." Plenty of sun and sand with several great resturant/bars on the beach.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Seven mile beach is glorious. Not the best walking beach but not bad either. The calm waters make for easy swimming paddle boarding and some decent snorkeling off the beach if you choose your location well. Go to GC snorkel guide website for the best locations
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,This beach is amazing and is the nicest beach I have ever visited. The sand is so clean and the water is so clear - it is just divine. It is quite expensive to use the facilities of a beach club and I would recommend finding a public access point to the beach which won't cost you any money.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Beautiful water... White sandy beach... Sand and not rocks! Huts on the beach for shade and picnic ... If I want to jet ski or go on the banana boat it is all there! There is also a restaurant an bar right on the beach... Yep - no complaints!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Best beach ever. Clean and free of peddlers and randoms. Long peaceful walks on the north end with attractions starting at the mid-point.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Nice beach to walk collect shells swim snorkel and just relax. Everything was close by. Hope to return in the future.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,One of the best beaches around. Clean and quiet! Water is clear and the sand is white. Very private all up and down the beach.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,If so Seven Mile Beach is the place for you. I must admit that I am a big-spending tourist; I would rather spend my time integrating myself into the local culture and seeing everyday life where I travel. So if you want the glitzy expensive shops and restaurants you will probably go for Seven Mile Beach.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Nice beach lovely sand and plenty of activities to do. It's only 5.5 miles in length these days but 5.5 miles of lovely pure sand.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Seven mile beach is a spectacular beach with white sand & turquoise waters. If that's not enough there is plenty of water sports available and great off beach snorkeling. Come see for yourself.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We walked nearly the whole length of the beach. It has busy sections but there are quiet areas to stretch out and relax in peace and quiet. Definitely worth a visit and easy enough to walk to from Georgetown.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,This beach was highly recommended but was told by some frequent users that the beach has been damaged by storms over the past few years and the sand was littered with broken coral so not the white soft sand beach we were expecting. Still a nice beach but it needs some cleaning up.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Not much to see here. All of the major US brands but father from the mainland. If you want to experience GC avoid Georgetown except for the airport.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We ended up there after our 4x4 jeep tour - an excursion from Carnival Magic. David and Wade were great guides and I was so proud to have driven a 4x4 jeep on the wrong side of the road. It was delightful.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,This is the main beach on Grand Cayman lined with grand hotels and long stretches of white sandy beaches. Lots of restaurants and beach amenities.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We stayed on Seven Mile Beach at the Ritz-Carlton and had a wonderful time. That area was marvelous. We can't wait to go back agin.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Spend as time here as you can gorgeous! Relax and enjoy the water sand and sights above and below he water! Grand Cayman is a beautiful and easy place to vacation.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,It was very nice that we could walk from our condo to our dive shop and a local bar. The sand is beautiful--the sunsets magic
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,The sun can be brutal and beach umbrellas are a must in the afternoon. We did not stay at one of the big hotels but our hotel did not have available for loan or rent beach umbrellas and there were none to be had at area stores. Very frustrating.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Just great to stroll up and down the beach all day people watching and snorkeling in the sea most wonderful fish angel fish at your feet as soon as you get in just peaceful and relaxing.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,One of the nicest beaches in the Caribbean but can be popular. We didn't get to spend much time here but would certainly do so on a return trip. Beautiful sand blue water and loads of water sports if you want to partake.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We loved 7 mile beach! We loved the white sand blue water and the weather! We always felt safe walking the beach! We had great snorkeling right off our hotel beach! We hope to doa return trip someday!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Had a wonderful time beautiful views and the most pleasant people. Can't wait to go back. The parasailing is fantastic and the stingrays oh boy say Hi to Stingray Bert.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Really warm clear blue water soft white sand whats not to like! Just spent ages swimming in the lovely caribbean sea. Not ideal for little children as it got deepish quite quickly ( about 4 feet deep)
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,I was a little surprised that there were very few sea shells lots of coral (I know the islands are made of coral) The beach itself was great soft sand and made for a nice long walk. Water was very clear.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Super commercial Packed and narrow in spots. Don't get people saying best beach ever. Last trip to St. John blew this beach out of water. cruise ship day trippers everywhere.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Cruised to Grand Cayman and visited 7 mile beach at the Royal Palms. The water was perfect. Just beautiful. We will visit every time we get to Grand Cayman!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Went on the banana boat with my son $15.00 each then snokled swam and booked para-sailing for $140.00 for 2.

g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Beautiful LONG white sandy beach with great snorkeling. You can go high end with chairs umbrellas drinks etc. Or you can pack a picnic and BYO everything. Literally miles of beach to explore and enjoy. Spent the week going from beach to beach. Loved it!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,This is where you need to stay for spectacular snorkling right off the beach beautiful well maintained beaches very nice hotels and restaurants near by. Best beach I have been to in the Carribean.

g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Actually only about 5.5 miles long but who's counting. Very nice with white sandy beaches. Clean and safe as well.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We enjoyed "Surfside" fun and food as we relaxed on the beach watching JetPack Cayman flying around and taking its guests on a flight. The beauty of seven mile beach is breathtaking and the beautiful clear and colorful water is so therapeutic to enjoy! This is such a great spot to unwind! Wayne & Elaine---Orlando Florida
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,A lovely long sandy beach with beautiful water for swimming and snorkelling.There are many snorkelling sites right off the beach. Very convenient to walk along and swim right from shore to some nice coral reefs.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,To date the best beach I have ever been on. Didn't want to leave. White sandy beach. Food. Drinks. Entertainment. Beautiful
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,What an experience. White sand walk out and snorkel right off the beach. We loved the Cemetary beach but be sure and take your lunch as there are no concessions. The other areas by the hotels and condos had food and drinks that the waiters walked around and offered you. Loved it.....going back in June!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,So amazing. Beautiful beautiful beaches.. just a little pricey for chairs etc.. but whatever you do DO NOT go to Calico Jacks!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Beautiful beach clear water good snorkeling. Stay way from the Marriott too many people on a small stretch of beach. Otherwise very nice!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,The beach was well maintained not crowded the water was cool but not cold the waves were very small the sand was not too rough. There are quite a few rocks right as you're getting into the water and it does become deep rather quickly. But for adults it's not a problem at all. Beautiful!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,If you like crowds then you'll love this beach. On the other hand we like less crowded beaches. We rented a jeep for the day - drove around the island and found a lovely private peach on the opposite side of this one. We had a wonderful day snorkelling and just relaxing in the sun.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,February was a nice time to visit. Our hotel was on the beach. Not to crowded clean and okay snorkeling for a public beach area.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Much better if you have transport is Rum Point Kaibo or Smith's Cove; less people and much prettier. The problem with 7 mile beach is there are lots of hotels/condos which own big stretches of the beach that you are not allowed on. Alsothe only good snorkelling is at the very top end at Cemetery beach.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We went to this beach me and my husband and another couple. The water is clear warm and beautiful. The sand is white and full of shells and coral bits. We ate at a restaurant right on the beach the food was delicious. We had a great time here! Would definitely come back!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,First we visited the beach with our own towels and the waitresses don't wait on you unless you have a towel from their resort. Take your own food and drink it's much cheaper anyway. The white sand and the crystal clear water are beautiful. It doesn't get any better than this.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,If you don't want to walk the whole beach to and from take a bus from comfort suites 2 bucks to cemetery beach and walk swim or run back / the water is warm thats what we did
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Never stayed here but went in a couple of times to swim and sun bathe. Lovely white sandy beach. Public beaches crowded at th weekend and Bank Holidays etc.We were on Govenors Beach. Couple of tables and a Portaloo. Take a picnic.= or pick up Kentucky Fried chicken on your way in.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We've been here many times over the years and the beach has shade near the cemetery so we set up there. We head out towards the reef and usually have good snorkeling
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,the transportation fron the piers to the beach show us a prity nice placeand teh bars resortshotel means all the environment you can see around is cool and the food options doyou have in this beach are amazingwater sportparasalingscubajet ski.banana boat.Spa. evrething we have a great days with a lot of fun.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Loved the beaches and the clear water. Fish swimming all around you! Just a few feet off shore there were schools of fish swimming
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Stayed at the Regal Beach Club and loved sunning and swimming on the beach there. During walks along the beach however I noticed that not all areas were as conducive to swimming because of the coral which made walking into the water a little more difficult. Once your are at swimming depth though there is nothing to worry about.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,You can see so many fish and other marine wildlife right off the beach..spotted rays sea turtles etc
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Beautiful Beach excursion included nice lunch beer and rum punch beach chair. There is snorkeling equipment available for small fee. The water is so blue and warm it is fantastic.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,This beach is awesome.. it is very long the water is warm clear calm.. fish swim up to you everywhere. My 5 year old was cruising around seeing fish close to the shore.. very exciting for him. Not crowded. The beach is huge so enough place for everyone even when the cruise ships are in town.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,The beach looks very nice but it is very small in comparison to other islands (Jamacia Punta Cana etc.).
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We were on the Carnival Freedom and choose this excursion. Transfers to/from are good. Beach is amazing. You can use the lounge chairs at no further cost. Free drink included. Recommend this excursion.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Seven Mile Beach definitely deserves a top rating for beaches of the world. This is the stuff that dreams are made of white sand crystal blue water and not too crowded if you avoid the spots used by the cruise lines.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,This is one of the greatest beaches in the world. So unfortunately it is very crowed and very commercial. The resorts line the beach end to end for almost the whole seven miles. The beach sand and water color are definitely worth seeing. I would see it and stand in the water. A real treat.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,The beach is great...a perfect place to swim or paddle. You can hang out all day...but there is very few places with shade.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,perfect sand - just right water temp - memorable sunsets - great walking beach - what is not to love?!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,This has to be the most beautiful beach with the clearest water. The best snorkeling and swimming. Jet skis para sailing and kayaking are just a few water sports always available.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Beautiful white sand beach with crystal clear water ..... and oh the colour of that water!!!! The snorkelling is not too bad to boot. It's a good walk from the cruise ship port but my wife and I walked to it but took a taxi on the way back.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Seven Mile Beach and the hotels/attractions in the area are one of the prettiest places I have ever been. The beaches are clean and lined with swanky hotels and yummy restaurants. If you have the pleasure of staying at one of these hotels make sure you take advantage of the location.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,We walked from the Ritz to the Marriott (its a workout) and we were just amazed by the beautiful sand and blue clear waters.
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Calm crystal clear azure water fine white sand and great beach front amenities make this one of the finest beaches anywhere!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,The beach was pristine and went on for miles whats not to like? Not crowded just gorgeous! Very easy access. If you want to snorkle you have to swim about 50 meters out but for those lazing about its perfect!
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 4 2016,Spent the day relaxing at the beach. We travelled here by taxi from the port to the Royal Palms Hotel. There we were able to rent chairs use the bathrooms and showers. We had excellent friend calamari and beer. It was a great place to relax for the day. We were able to walk and swim.
g147367,d2385044,March 3 2016,Hopped off a tour bus the moment we seen the beach. Nice relaxing place. We did not happen to be by a resort or anything so chairs and umbrellas were out of the question. Still had a great time. Was able to flag down a bus and get back to the ship.
g147367,d2385044,March 3 2016,This is an amazing place. The water is a beautiful blue-green clear calm and relatively shallow until the drop off allowing you to enjoy the beach. The sand is soft and ready for sand castle building. The waves are typically calm. Oh the sunsets are absolutely magical. We come here all the time and love it.
g147367,d2385044,March 3 2016,Although technically only about 5 miles long Seven Mile Beach is one of my favorites. I enjoy going for a 2 mile walk along the beach first thing in the morning. The water is beautiful safe for swimming and quite sandy with little seaweed. Perfect view for a Cayman Sunset.
g147367,d2385044,March 3 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 2 2016,It is peaceful and amazing and soft sand and great people. Closest you can come true heaven and not die! Sunsets are amazing and I will not say to die for ha ha ha
g147367,d2385044,March 2 2016,Beautiful white sand clear blue water. You can see the clarity of the water for quite a way out. The beach is combed clean every morning. Even with busy hotels the beach did not seem too crowded. The Caribbean water is clean and warm perfect to play in!
g147367,d2385044,March 1 2016,We spent our family vacation on this clean beautiful peaceful beach. You can be as active or restful as you like. There is something for everyone. There are no heavy water currents - perfect for swimming. Although this is far from a secluded beach it is never too loud. "Simply beautiful."
g147367,d2385044,March 1 2016,This was a port of call for us and it was absolutely amazing.. The entrance to the island was breathtaking.. We took a bus ride to the beach and when we arrived it was absolutely AMAZING.. The underwater scenery was the most beautiful thing ive ever seen.. The drop off was incredible..Well worth the money!!
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Excellent beach with spectacular view and water activies. One of the best beaches we have ever visited and that is saying a lot as we lived in Hawaii and Southern California and have visited beaches all over the world!
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Just as the name implies this is a long 7 miles of pristine beach with many individual names along the stretch of sand. All of them good. This is why people come here.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,We visited Seven Mile beach during our stay on Grand Cayman. WOW! LOTS of cruise ships and resorts are packed! If you like the party scene this is the spot!
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Seven Mile Beach might be the best beach in the world! Water colors are turquoise temperature is warm snorkeling is beyond words great and the white sand never gets hot on your feet.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,The water is so pretty! There is so much to do on 7 mile beach. So much things to see too. The water is crystal clear so it is very good to snorkel.Softest sand ever! Overall amazing beach!
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Beautiful beach. I didn't do the 7 mile walk (if that's possible?) but it was gorgeous in front of the Marriott and the Westin. The Marriott has a much smaller beach and is cramped. The beach in front of the Westin is just perfect.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,came here off the cruise ship.. cant really walk it but we tried.. took about 30 mins but along a very busy road.. taxi back was far easier. plenty of beach but also a lot of beach chairs for rent or private to hotels..not a quiet beach but fun.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,One of the best beaches in the world. Done the Med Indian Ocean islands Africa Caribbean Pacific and this place has to be right up as one of the best !
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Stayed on Seven Mile and having visited many resort places over the year can attest to this being the most beautiful beach in the world. No begging or selling and very safe for families.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,There's only one thing to like about this beach ... it's 7 miles long. Well actually 6.5miles. Enjoy it.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,We took the city "bus" which really is a mini van to Seven Mile Beach from our cruise ship. It is a beautiful beach but very crowded. We didn't have a lot of time though so it was fine for us.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,I love Seven Mile Beach. Gorgeous aqua blue warm water palm trees things to do and places to see and be seen. Some of the most beautiful public parks are here. If you have the chance to visit Grand Cayman whether it's on a cruise ship or a vacation this truly is a must see!
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,I want to go back!! this is the ultimate warm sand warm ocean tropical clear turquoise water...There is not much to Grand Cayman to me except this beach. I couldn't find a private area but we went to a bar at some main resort area on the beach (overpriced drinks though.)
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,white sand blue water great atmosphere. the best time to go is on the weekend where you only have the people that are staying on the island there. during the week the cruise ships croud the beach but there is a lot more to do then but yet again busy. will be back.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,some great little secluded spots but it is the most popular beach on the island...especially when cruise ships are in.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,You can walk forever and see many people or few people. Lots of amenities to be found up and down the beach.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Best snorkeling right in front of our condo. Hated to leave!! Abeautiful beach to walk and enjoy the Cayman sunsets.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else on the island and experience the real Cayman Islands. SMB is just a piece of Florida moved a few hundred miles south. There are many beautiful empty palm-lined beaches less than an hour's drive away!
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,This was an excursion we had thru cruise lines. So perfect didnot want to leave. The bus ride was kinda rough. saw some poor sections in the island while on the way to beach
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Get a condo and snorkel at the governors reef!! Westin Casuarina is nice and there are tons of condos for weekly and daily rent
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Crystal clear water white sand not too much current. Great for swimming or walking up and down. Awesome sunsets. This time around we stayed in the hotel not directly on the Seven Mile beach but we had no problem getting to it by parking on the street and walking in on one of many access paths.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Seven Mile Beach has great beach areas. The snokeling is amazing. I would highly recommend Cemetary Beach at Seven Mile. If you have an under water camera or camera snorkeling mask you won't be disappointed.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,This beach was beautiful!! Very clean and quiet beaches. You can take a walk either in the sand or waste high in the crystal clear water for miles! Awesome!
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,White powdery sand for 6.9 miles? It has to be one of the most beautiful beaches in the world. If you like taking photos the morning would be the best since the sun will be at your back.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Although busy over Christmas time there always seems to be enough room for everyone on this beach. The water is fantastic and you can snorkel just a short way into the ocean. A 5 star beach!
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,A lot of the beaches on Grand Cayman are quite rocky. So it is really nice to have a big sandy beach but it is crowded during high tourist time. Lots of water sport options along the beach.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,The beach is nice but crowded. There are a lot of other beaches around the island that are not as crowded. You will need a care to get around to those.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,I loved this beach. I loved taking a stroll and then jumping in the water and going snorkeling. There are so many cool reefs. I snorkeled all throughout. I saw so many cool fish but best of all I saw an eel.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Nice beach but stay away from Governor's beach access point. Crime here. The rest of the beachs' are nice.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Absolutely stunning beach! This is such a great beach for anyone from couples to families. We stayed at the Marriott but walked up and down the beach. It is so nice to look at the crystal clear water!
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,I was not too impressed with 7 mile beach. Clearwater Beach > 7 mile. The sand area is too narrow. Crowded with lounge chairs. Scenery is beautiful. Don't make this your only stop for cruise excursion.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Great beach in Grand Cayman with a lot of water sports activities. Prices are a little fight but not outrageous as you can find in some vacation destinations.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,go as North as possible to get away from the tourists. white sands. blue seas. really beautiful!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,We did go to the North End away from the hotels and traffic. I love the white sand and the warm beautiful water. It is very easy to get around on the local buses. We did to to the north end to snorkel but if you need facilities stay around the public access and hotel area.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Sand is like sugar water is clear and blue. Can't beat this beach great for walking. We went here nearly every day.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,One of the Best beaches in the world. I like the sand water and people. Lots of fine hotels and condos in all price ranges
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Can't say its amazing but it could be our location at the south end. Be sure to book further north as the beach is very narrow rocky has hidden sea urchins and is caulk a block busy :-(
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,the seven mile beach is so beautiful and the sand so white and you could walk for miles like that. the color of the water is so blue/grn its a site to see
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,The sand is soft the water crystal clear but the beach scence needs more atmosphere. We stayed at the Ritz Carlton walked 1-2 miles to find a local beach bar/restaurant which lacked any sort of Caymanian vibe.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,this is just as nice but much better services and bars to be found. great snorkelling. easy to find free parking. and unlike veradero there are jetski rentals! def the next best reason to come here after the world class diving.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Cystal clear water fine white sand. Nice for walking lounging swimming and snorkeling. We went in November and there was a really nice breeze the entire time it was never too hot or too cold. It was absolutely perfect.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,We spend part of each day walking the beach and area probably up to 5 miles round trip. The sand and water are perfect. You just need to remember the sunscreen! Great snorkling off the beach in numerous locations.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Floating in the crystal clear waters of SMB is the best de-stressor ever! The water is refreshing in November like a warm bath in late September.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,I have been to Cayman Island several times and always make sure to go to Seven Mile Beach. It is the most beautiful sand and incredible water.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,This beach is amazing. Yes you can get tourist traffic and bars/restaurants but I still love going here. The beach is clean and the water is so clear. There are more secluded beach towards if you keep walking away from the restaurants etc. So pretty
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Wonderful afternoon at Cemetery Beach. The snorkeling was nice as it was easy entry on the sandy beaches. It did not get very deep and we even saw two sting rays.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,One of the world's best beaches but in places pretty busy from hotel crowds. Unlike other beaches th beach is all public so you walk its entire length without detours.

g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Too many people! Too much noise! The beach was beautiful but if you are looking for peace and quiet this is not the place for you.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Seven Mile Beach is quite beautiful but the narrow road and traffic made the trip a little less than perfect.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Beautiful blue- Clear Water friendly people enjoy yourself or with your love ones. We stayed @ the Hyatt resort and had our lunch there it was ok but the beach itself made us much happier.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,This beach is absolutely beautiful; however in some locations it 's extremely rocky! I definitely recommend swim shoes!
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Beautiful sand clear warm water with plenty of activities (if that's what you are looking for) and not over-commercialized! You can walk freely without being hounded to buy trinkets rent jet skis or have your hair braided. The perfect getaway but still in the middle of plenty of 21st century luxuries!
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Been to different Islands and 7 mile ranks as one of the best just for the beach and the water. If you like calm waters this is the place for you. Only reason I didn't rate it higher is lack of surf
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,The reason I rate it "best" is because we tried all the beaches for snorkeling/swimming and Seven Mile (anywhere on it) is protected and water is always calm and clear. You don't need water shoes- most areas have a lovely beach entry and reefs right off the shore.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Went on a Monday around 11AM. Two cruise ships in port that day. Beach was nice. We were able to rent two lounge chairs from the locals. $5 a chair. We chose not to rent an umbrella. There was a lot of noise people traffic and 3 ice cream trucks playing their music.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Stayed 5 days at the Marriott...loved every minute in the Island..hardest thing to do was pack bags to go home! Friendly people everywhere.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Amazing shades of blue and turquoise with clean white sand beaches. Plenty of bars and restaurants within easy walking distance. Quiet romantic and wonderful!
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,What's not to love - powdery white sand warm clear blue water excellent snorkling. Everything a beach vacation should be.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,If you want a beach to relax with perfect clear water no waves over 6 inches cool clean sand with a sunset view.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,soft sand beaches entertaining people to watch plenty of restaurants and bars rental chairs and umbrellas
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,The water is perfect the sea is calm and the price to rent a lounge chair or umbrella comes with free bottled water. Clean sand not too crowded clean bathrooms and a nice bar and restaurant with decent food.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,I swear we didn't see 200 people on 7MB all week. We went there nearly every afternoon for a walk and to watch the sun set. Beautiful sand gorgeous water; what else do you need?
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,It's OK but can get overcrowded with cruise ship passengers but still worth a visit. A great view along the coast line. A bit overrated in my opinion
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,The better restaurants were great. Only downer was Royal Palms at lunch. Service was awful for lunch
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Gorgeous beach! Clear calm turquoise water that looks like it belongs on a postcard!! Sand is soft and white.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,I love this place. I visited a few times in Oct/Nov - and it's usually not very busy - peaceful GORGEOUS sand & water. I like Governor's beach. I'm still in Cayman - if you're age 20-35 or so down to earth and will be in town please say hello. I'm here till Dec. 2012
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Grand cayman is beautiful but by far one of the more expensive islands we have visited! exchange on US dollar does not help either! All food was excellent but expensive!
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,The beach was a little small due to storms in the area but the entire beach area is very nice. Public beaches are a great way to meet the locals and hear about some special places that tourists do not normally see and visit.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,My husband and I went on a cruise to Grand Cayman and went on an excursion to 7 mile beach. It was outstanding! It was so beautiful and very fun!
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Just off the main drag. A great spot to hang out or just relax. It's better to just bring food with you although fast food eateries are nearby some walking distance. Just be prepared for over-crowing when any event is taking place there.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Beautiful white sand fronting the clear aqua Caribbean. Not crowded with sunbathers in October. Enjoyed watching crabs dodging the incoming waves scampering in the sand and crawling in their sandholes. Be sure to wear sunscreen. Sun is strong here and it's easy to get a sunburn.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,It is the most beautiful clean and pristine beach anywhere. The water is just gorgeous and you get the most beautiful view of an evening sunset.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,The beach was awesome! Watch out for rocks (walking into the ocean and walking on the beach) and you'll have an amazing time walking on the soft sands of Seven Mile Beach or swimming in the shallow clear waters.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,The sand is beautiful and falls through your tows like silk. Only 50 yards off shore you can be snorkelling on amazing reefs very safe and very clean. The water is very clear.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,The water is so blue and the beach is beautiful!! A great place to sun and relax underneath blue skies!!
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Everything happens on Seven Mile Beach. This is where you will find the restaurants of choice movies bars stores gift shops tours and downtown area. East End is dead compared to this. So be sure to book your resort on this side of the island.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Beautiful white sands that strectch for what seems like forever! The water has a beautiful emerald and blue color and is crystal clear when not wavy!
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,We kayaked along Seven Mile beach while on a cruise shore excursion. The water was gorgeous. I was a little worried about kayaking in the ocean but the water was very calm. We attempted to snorkel off Governor's Beach but no one in our group saw any marine life.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,We visited Seven Mile Beach. We relaxed on free beach chairs and spent some time trying to decide if this was the most beautiful beach we had ever seen. I think so. Snorkelling here was so-so but we were spoiled by the fantastic dive sites on the island. There was a cruise ship in port but somehow no crowds.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,sunbeds and umbrellas cost about $6 each. toilets and changing rooms free. not really 7 miles because the whole island is little more than that.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Grand Cayman knows it has a great beach and they take very good care of it. Beaches are always very clean from downtown all the way up to West Bay and beyond. Very safe too. Water is crystal clear and sealife plentiful even when you wade in. Best beach in the world!!!
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Great white sand azure waters that are crystal clear softly sloping sandy bottom for a hundred yards out great snorkeling with lots of tropical fish and always a little grass hut or shop where you can get cold drinks and munchies.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Great beach with plenty of activity for everyone. From wave runners paddle boarding snorkeling para sailing there is something for everyone. And the water so clear you can see the ocean floor down to 50 feet.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,One of the best beach vacations! Beautiful water and white sand. There is lots of activities available or you can just relax.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Lovely spot to stay again and again and again. The snorkeling is incredible and the beach is prestine.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Beautiful beach but very busy. Of course we visited when the cruise ships were in. We preferred the north side of the island where is was more low key. If you like to be in the middle of all the action this is the spot for you.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Beach is beast at the North end. Nice sand and ginny clear warm water. Its a place to visit regularly.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Took a cab from cruise port to beach (5 dollars for bus/van/cab) The beach was not as wide as anticipated and was crowded. It was crowded for a reason. It is beautiful. The water is pristine . Perfect for snorkeling relaxing or swimming. Lots of rentals for Paddleboards jet Ski's etc. Really a fantastic beach. Worth the trip.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,

g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Nothing to dislike...greatt palce to visit for snorkeling. Warm claear clean waters. Short hop to Camana Bay for shopping and dinning.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Seven mile beach is a beautiful white sand beach. The water is warm calm and clear and there is great snorkeling right off the beach with good visibility. I would recommend buying bringing or renting a float or tube and just enjoying the water.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Friendly people with big smiles and amazingly friendly waiting to greet you at every place you go. Helpful kind and considerate ready to make your experience with them all they can!
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,What a beautiful beach and the colors of the ocean really make this a great place to spend time while you're on Grand Cayman.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Water's great beach is long and wide and in the off season there weren't many folks out. There are condos private homes and hotels all along the beach but the beach chairs were almost all empty.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,This was amazing to see the calm water was so inviting and easy for swim in snorkeling. Plenty of beach chairs Gazebo's and showers. Perfect if you are new to snorkeling or have kids! We really enjoyed this beach! Off season NO Crowds was the best part!
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Beautiful beach. Great sand warm water great atmosphere...very nice. My wife and I stayed at Cayman Beach Suites and loved it...a little pricey but the environment is great.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,...but in the off season fabulous. A lot like Grace Bay Beach Provo T&C although not as chic. Much more to do and better food. Less good diving unless one is a wall afficianado.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,I live where you vacation. It's what a lot of us locals like to say. :) SMB is a beautiful place. Gorgeous no matter what time of the day or night.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Been here before when the water was choppy but this time it was so calm. Beach and sand is gorgeous! Crystal clear water. What more could you ask for?
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,We spent an afternoon at Cemetery Beach at the north end of 7 mile beach. Good shade to sit under and decent snorkeling.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Top place to stay on he island. Check with hotels to see if they have a beech front as some hurricanes have washed away the beeches on the west side. More towards Georgetown such as comfort suites and merriott. Only three feet of beech left as of August 2012
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,White sand clear and clean sea and happy atmosphere. Bars along the beach when you need them. Public beaches and hotel owned areas.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Emerald green water in crystal clear. If you want to be amaze relax meditate or change your perpective in life stay they from sunrise to sundown and you will never be the same again.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,A nice pretty much isolated beach with great snorkeling! Next to a cemetery but with easy access. It is on seven mile beach.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,just perfect. go get a drink at westin bar. see bartender bob. a real character! maybe the best mai tai ever!
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,

g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Withstand perfect clear water... great views.. minimal wave height very safe for children ................................>>>>>>>>>
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Sand was nice water was perfect (clarity was a bit cloudy on the wavier days). I would have to say this was one of the best beaches on Grand Cayman. Definitely worth a day of stopping to swim if you are here!
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Seven mile beach is simply excellent. The water is so clear you can see the bottom like looking through glass. The white sand is soft and powdery. Small reefs dot the coast in many places just within 50 ft so you can snorkel right out of your beach condo/hotel.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Having been to Cayman many years ago I can not believe how built but seven mile beach it BUT its charm and beauty are still the same. Glad to return and it will not be so long next time.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,There are a number of beaches on Seven Mile Beach that you can just swim into the water and see beautiful coral reefs with lots of fish turtles and coral.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,everything Nice clean and the people are very friendly been to many vacation resorts and this is definitely top of the list.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,This is a beautiful stretch of beach lined with upscale hotels and condos. The beach itself is very quiet uncrowded. Do bring sunscreen as it doesn't have shade.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,An amazing crystal clear beach. We were at the Ritz Carlton and must have wales the entire 7 miles. The visibility in the water had to have been at least 50 - 75feet.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,

g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,The beaches in Grand Cayman are beautiful. The water is crystal clear. The food was reasonablely priced and so good. I tried the CayBrew but didnt like it. Overall it was a very nice place
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,just amazing the whitest sand I have ever seen and cristla clear water. Only busy when cruise ships are in town don't go then
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,snorkeling right outside of the Marriott was amazing! The beach however was very small no privacy all the chairs were lined up in 3 rows back to back like a movie theater. That was awful!
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Seven mile beach has lots of great places along the beach. In the morning it is a beautiful place to jog or walk. At night the sunset is beautiful.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Generally crowded. Go to other beaches like Smith Cove or Cemetery Beach. Better snorkeling at those as well.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,We stayed at Cayman Reef Resort. Great for early morning footing kids' fun sports and unforgetable sunsets.Reastaurants and shops all very close.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,

g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Beautiful beach. Caught the wind though. Really rough seas But have been other times that the sea s are calm. Sopretty
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,There are places along the beach to rent chairs and use the bathroom facilitys. The beaches are pretty but rocky. Use water shoes when swimming there are lots of rocks and sea urchins. Snorkeling is not great but we did see some fish. Its a great place to get some sun but Ive seen better beaches.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Sunshine white sand blue water and colorful fish a little piece of heaven right here in Cayman. Relax and enjoy!
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,I live across the road from 7 mile beach and I try to go every Sunday. The kids love it! The water is beautiful!
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Liked the beaches and stingrays. Food is expensive.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,The water is amazingly clear & beach is nice although walking the night before there was trash everywhere but when we arrived today it was gone. I could have stayed there all day close to restrooms (clean) & Calico Jacks with volleyball. Downfall is they charge $5 for chairs & not even sure if they can.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,how can you not like & mile beach....Clean and clear water
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,

g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,clean very sofr white sand -- pretty beach--fairlycalm nice snorkeling spot can get pretty busy when hotels full and beach is narrow- but nice beach
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,this public beach is neat and very pleasant. You can walk a long way and it is quiet at this time of the year.

g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,you can walk and walk and walk and the sand is always perfect the water lovely. Pass by many many hotels and folks out burning themselves in the brilliant sun. Nice to walk it at night too.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,If you go when the ships are not in the whole town is pretty much closed down. If the ships are in it is an awsome place to shop. But the people go back to the ships about 2 so the town is closed down by 3

g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Whether you are into beach lounging scuba diving fishing snorkeling - the Seven Mile Beach has it all. I've never seen water this clear and blue. Every picture you take there will be screensaver-worthy. Vacation well-spent.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,spectacular view incredibly smooth sand along the beach. Much of the beach seems to be sectioned off for private hotels and condos but it is worth the visit.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Pick your poison - snorkeling scuba diving boating fishing stingray swimming paddleboarding kayaking jetskiing etc. It is very family friendly too!

g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,We stayed at Coral Stone Club with a beautiful view of Seven Mile Beach. It's a gorgeous white sand beach with clear calm water (most of the time). We spent lots of time just floating and relaxing here. If I ever make it back to Grand Cayman I'll be staying on SMB again!
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,We stayed at the Westin Casurina Resort and they have one of (if not the) largest beaches on 7 mile beach. The sand is like white powder and the water is like glass.

g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Clean no litter not crowded crystal clear water.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Aside from the fabulous dining abounding on this beach strip the beach itself is pristine and such a sweep of pure white sand it takes your breath away. The contrast with the varying blues aquas and other splendid ocean hues was memorable. Really beautiful!

g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,BEST private beach on Seven Mile. Never crowded and plenty of room to sunbathe swim and build a sand castle.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Sorry we didn't do this and I don't know how to take off my review. It looks fun from the website! :)
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,We spent 99% of our time here in the water so I have no idea about the rest of the beach. We walked off our bus plunked down our towels and went right in. The water is crystal clear and a stunning shade of blue. Highly recommend this beach.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Low numbers and a great parasail from Parasail Professionals made the day special.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,I haven't been everywhere in the world but of all the places I've been so far this is the prettiest ocean water I've ever seen. It's crystal clear and warm. The beach and sand are clean. The waves are low and gentle. It's heaven on earth!
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,The sand is so nice at this beach. The water is amazing clear and refreshing. There's a lot of Coral in some areas but mostly only where the water is deep. Its a great beach for snorkeling.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Swim snorkel relax...my family love 7mile beach clean sand sparkling blue ocean. Bring a picnic and some drinks and just chill. Walk along the beach and you will find bars and watersports galore.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Love this place. Been to so many Caribbean islands and I have to say this is as safe clean and beautiful as any place I have visited. Won't have people trying to sell you cheap tourist junk on this beach only beautiful water white sand and fun in the sun.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,On a Disney cruise we took a shuttle to 7 mile beach. Hardly any beach very narrow Beautiful sand and waters. Waters clear no seaweed Lots of people not very relaxing. Construction going on right next to beach Would take the time to find a quieter beach farther from the port
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,The sand at the beach was soft. The water was very blue clean and at a very easy to swim temperature
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,The water is great the color's amazing. People were happy and helpful. You can just walk out and snorkel anywhere you want (unlike going to 'Cabo'). The sunset was amazing as well!!!!
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,We stayed with friends that live right on Seven Mile Beach. We spent every morning walking the beach. The afternoons were spent lounging on the beach playing Frisbee and snorkeling in the crystal clear blue water.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,If walking on the beach is what you like to do this is the place. White sand and clear water warm water is a beach goers paradise. There is good snorkeling everwhere.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,We stayed in a condo on 7 mile beach. Snorkeled with our young kids. It was so awesome and easy. Just swam right off the beach.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Awesome beach doesn't get any better than this. white sand and friendly people. can even swim/snorkel to some of the wrecks off the beach if you're a strong swimmer
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Obviously since it's "7 mile" beach each area is different. But they're all gorgeous. Cemetary beach is nice and not as busy. There are lots of cute shops and many many many jewelry/watch stores. :)
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,We stayed in the middle of Seven Mile Beach - Casa Caribe Condos. The beach was wonderful we swam and snorkeled walked and jogged the beach. The sand is wonderful and the water was amazing and clear. Best beach I have been to. Will definately be back to Seven Mile Beach.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Athletes - you must try to run the whole beach. Incredibly challenging but lots of fun!
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,It rained during our visit so we didn't get to spend as much as we would have liked exploring but the beach in front of our condo (Beachcomber) was lovely.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,What a beautiful beach. The views are amazing just be careful of cruise ships. when the are in port it can get crowded.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,We loved sitting under a palm tree and snorkeling in the water.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,For the beach lover in you. Sure to get and keep you relaxed
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,So much garbage strewn across this beach and in the water made it really hard to focus on the beach itself. It is a very long stretch of golden sand and turquoise water but there are NO fish in the area and snorkelling is not an option. It gets excessively busy too. There are nicer spots elsewhere.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Typical cruise crowd and overpriced food and drinks at Calico Jacks. Ok for what it is but much better options to be found on the island.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,everybody tent to go to the same place to have fun and find a lot of people from the cruise ships. But the sand is nice clear water you can find food drinks and rent umbrellas or chairs if you need.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,On the beach all day long beautiful sunsets and great for people watching
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,This is a do not miss spot on Grand Cayman. We stayed at the Sunshine Suites across the street and enjoyed the beach for strolls and swimming as well as just relaxing. There are rentals of watersports equipment available if you like. Clear water and soft sands were all we required and it delivered!
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,what a way to unwind and learn to relax after working hard all year. having trouble readjusting back to earth. take yourselves on a wonderful vacation
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,You can snorkel right from the beach! Water is crystal clear and the beaches are clean and free from people trying to sell you wares. Loved it
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Great long beach (although not quite 7 miles long!) with variety of water sports availaible private lots hotels & condos.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,While staying at the Westin we enjoyed our strolls up this gorgeous stretch of beach
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Locals are friendly noone has their hand out here. Clean wonderful beach we will be back.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,It is one of the best beach areas in the world offering a diversity of fun. You can snorkel at Cemetary Beach you can swim at Seven Mile Public Beach and Smith Cove.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Stayed at the Westin lovely! Great staff very helpful and courteous!
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,This beach is beautiful and I enjoyed every moment there!
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Wow - best beach I've been to. We keep going back year after year because it is small and not very busy
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Too crowded for my taste but indeed a lovely beach for swimming
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,We stayed across the street from the beach but it was only a short walk. It is a beautiful wide white sandy beach. The water was relatively calm so it was very easy to swim in and I didn't have to struggle with rocks or shifting sand to get out.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,OK for the young crowd but I would never stay there. Busy beaches and I was there in May ! Good for a day trip.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Soft sand beneath your feet gorgeous turquoise waters and God's warmth shining on you! What's not to love?
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,If visiting you must stay on the seven mile beach!!
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,7 mile beach area is very good area to make your home base on vacation! The proximity to all the major tourist attractions is great.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,white sandy beach that you can walk for miles no one bothering you or selling their wares nice and peaceful on a clam day great for swimmimg and snorkling
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,My husband and I really enjoyed staying on Seven Mile Beach. It was not over crowded and you can eat/drink on the beach or even find more secluded spots if you desire. We loved the beach and we had snorkles and saw many amazing fish and sea life. Loved it!
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Can't beat the lovely sunsets! We loved the fact that restaurants liquor stores and grocery stores were all walking distance from our condo!
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,No where compares to the seven mile beach! It was clear clear nd the most beautiful beach anywhere.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Beautiful natural beach. The water is warm and the colours are like every picture of caribbean you see in magazines and the internet. No one pesters you here.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,7 Mile beach is nice to walk on. Water is clear as long as it is not too windy..then it milks up. Good snorkel area by the Marriott very small reef with a few species of fish. Fun to take bread or frozen peas to feed fish. Sand is white and soft
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Excellent stay at unit 12 recently renovated. Great location right on seven mile beach
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,I had never seen a cruise ship in "real life" before - awesome!
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,We preferred the quieter side of the island and stayed at the Turtle Nest Inn in Bodden Town. We also preferred the smaller stand alone restaurants on the east side.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Great place if you like great food people all around and want to spend money shopping. Jewelry is a must.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,What a wonderful walking beach. The waves lap at the sand. There is a small incline to the water.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,if you like white sandy beaches swimming in deep water and hanging out with your friends come here.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Pick a resort on seven mile beach. This is where everything really is and close to camana bay. Long long sandy beach sand swimming is beautiful.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Very clear. Saw some good fish snorkeling. Lots of free beach access. Grab a map for locations.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,What a relaxing area you can snorkel from as well. Wonderful time there!
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,its a very safe and well kept clean beach easy access by car and perfect for sunset walks on the beach.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,BEAUTIFULL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Of course it helps that this was our first visit to the ocean!!. Go when the Cruse ship are not in port you willl really enjoy it. So cool to look down the white sandy beach!!!!
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Pretty water and beach. Too many people. Parking was not so great either.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Stay away from the big hotels and rent a condo on the beach. There are plenty. Harbour Heights is where we stayed and it was perfect. Far but close. Very clean beaches. Great snorkeling right outside.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Recently stayed at the Marriott Resort on Seven Mile Beach. What a beautiful beach. White sand and crystal clear water.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Goes on forever! Great walk beautiful sandy beach with gorgeous blue ocean.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,A long white barefoot beach with clear blue ocean in front of you. We even went snorkelling from the deck of our restaurant
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,We got a taxi and went to a fully equipped beach...resteraunt bathrooms ect. It was GORGEOUS!! The water crystal clean and the sand like powder! The 'public' beach was not as nice and crowded. As a taxi drive and they know where to take you!
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,A beautiful clear water calm beach with lots of beautiful white sand...but lots of people too. We went one day that no cruise ships were in harbor and it was deserted almost! The next day we went there were tons of people. We snorkeled here and actually saw some eagle rays!
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Very pretty beach but too many people. Prefer less crowded beaches.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,The beach is quite pretty--white sand clear water. There are several bars fronting the beach and the typical cast of characters. Traffic is pretty heavy especially when the cruise ships come in. Good place to go if you like being close to other people. Definitely worth a visit though.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,The beach is beautiful to walk or run along. The sunsets are amazing.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,We snorkeled right off this beach where our condo was located. It was great. The waves weren't too strong and there was a lot to see under the water.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,I was there for a cruise day..went to a part with the word grape in it it was very nice  we were with the crowds for awhile and than we walked down to a secluded part of the beach in front of some condos. It's was one of the best beaches I've ever been to...
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,The beach was very nice but you have to rent a lounge for the day and when you are taking a cab back to the port make sure it is almost full as they will not leave until it is.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,The beach is awesome -- great sand and so clean. Water is beautiful! We walked the beach every day snorkeled and kayaked! Several public beaches and fun bars to stop at for a beverage. Nice not to have vendors peddling their wares at you on the beach! Great beach!!
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Peaceful quite white sand beach. Water was crystal blue and warm.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,What a beaufiful beach! My friends go to Greece each summer and did not go because of the trouble last year and asked me if this beach would hold up to their standards. Well it surpasses what they expected and are accustome to so Wow for Seven Mile Beach!
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,you can stroll on the public beach for the full 7 miles lots of places for good snorkeling right off the beach and lots of bars restaurants and shopping all along 7 MIle beach road.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Get your swimming suit on. Walk it. When sunny...one of the most beautiful places on earth. GET OUT THERE. You have NOT seen Grand Cayman unless you walk the good stretch of Seven Mile Beach from the Marriott to the Ritz.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,This spot has plenty to do! A great walk along the beach. Lots of places to grab a bite to eat my fav was the reef grill
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,You won't find finer sand or bluer water anywhere and plans move the road and make the beach wider will only make things better.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,The best beach I've been on in the Caribbean! I only saw one piece of trash on the beach the entire time I was there. Plus no pesky vendors.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Spent some time on the beach while in port with the Carnival Valor. Absolutely gorgeous beach. Stunning white sand crystal clean turquoise water. Wish I could have stayed for a full week!
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,We have been to many Caribbean islands and Hawaii and nothing compares. Beautiful white sand. Amazing water calm and clarity. Snorkel right from the beach or lounge all day in relatve solitude. The perfect place!
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Absolutely amazing beach. Perfect white sand with ever blue and clear water gently lapping on the shore. The beach is quiet and very friendly to all ages. Little to no waves and a tide that only fluctuates about 1ft all day.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Easy access uncrowded and lots of fish both close to shore and further out. Our favorite spot is cemetery beach and reef at the North end so we rented a condo this year at the Aqua Bay Club about 300 yards South.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,beautiful sand and crystal clear water with snorkeling right off the beach
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,We took a bus ride there from the port and it took about 20 minutes. The beach is clean and very crowded. The water is very clear. It was very nice and we enjoyed it very much.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Great beach with easy access from most of the hotels. It can get a little crowded at times but there is usually plenty of room to spread out your towel or beach chair. The water is warm and clean with not a lot of curent
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Amazing sand and wonderful water. Soft powder sand...light brown. Beautiful water and generally shallow...we felt safe in the water in front of our condo. Our new favourite beach!
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,1st trip to the 7mile beach Grand Cayman...it was wonderful! Relaxing clean safe crystal clear water. Enjoyed snorkeling at Governor's Reef. Great restaurants along 7 mile beach easy public transportation to get around the island. 1st rate experience!
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,The most beautiful white sand beaches I have every been on are still just as amazing as they were the first time I saw them 28 years ago.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Been to so many beaches in the Pacific and Atlantic. Grand Cayman's 7-mile beach cannot be topped (we like St. John's beaches equally). Almost zero human pollution along the beach and in the sea. All the Cayman-ites are good spirited and love to meet visitors. It's a place to unwind go offline and enjoy the sunshine and world class beaches.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,We loved it! Sunsets at 5p and will return! We found Royal Palms on our walk and enjoyed the music and service. We went for drinks and appetizers. Would definitely recommend!
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,We stayed at a hotel on the beach I would recommend as there's lots of snorkling opportunities and evening strolls available. Busy in some areas but the sunsets are amazing!
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Great stretch of beach for snorkeling & walking. Beach is awesome white sand and the water colors are amazing.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,We stayed on Seven Mile Beach. We enjoyed the ability to walk out from our condo directly to the water. We were within walking distance of Cemetery Beach where the snorkling is a bit better with more to see.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,The water was nice and certainly the beach is not as rocky as the others on the island. But lots of garbage in the sand and tons of people off of the cruise ships. We preferred Rum Point
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Great opportunity to run or walk on a clean beach with plenty of people watching available!
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,A great beach to walk on and there are lots of things to do!
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Soaked away for hours in this water and basked in the sun snorkeled and swam with the tropical fish one of the best beaches we have visited
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,There's nothing to dislike and it has to be seen to be believed the colour of the water is like nothing else!!
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,This beach is gorgeous! The softest sand I've eve felt between my toes. Very clean. Perfect for morning and evening walks. Nice natural covering to hang out in when the sun's a bit too hot. Seeing this beach is one of my top 5 beaches of the Caribbean.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Some what crowded but we had a great time playing at the beach
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,I expected more from the way people talked. It was narrower than it looked in photos - I guess I was expecting it to compare to the beach on Grace Bay Providenciales.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Head to the north end of 7-Mile Beach - just beyond the Westin. Less crowded and more local feel. A section called Governor's beach (because it sits directly in front of the Governor's House) is our favorite.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,it is so clean beautiful sand and water. There are great bathroom facilities available and chairs to use along the way.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,This is one beach not to miss....you can walk swim snorkel eat drinkand hang out in many different places along this beach. It has the clearest calm waters every day!
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,spent a lot of time walking and relaxing on the beach. beautuful sand lots of space. not overcrowded
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Beautiful beach great swimming and walking. Can be very busy but we really liked Calico Jacks beach bar they have good food picnic tables showers and bathrooms.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,White sand crystal clear waters clean snorkeling right off of beach.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Excellent resorts and restaurants! Amazing white sand and crystal blue waters!
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Warm calm turquiose water... just a beautiful beach. Can get crowded sometimes but one of the best in the Carribean if not THE best
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Water was beautiful and the sand is so smooth. Public bathrooms were nice and clean Plenty of water activities to engage in. One of the most beautiful beaches I have seen.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Gorgeous sunsets all kinds of sea life just off of shore.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,The beach and waters were amazing. Went snorkeling a lot of fish to see right off shore. The chairs were $10 each to rent for the day
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Seven Mile Beach - especially farther north of Georgetown - is lovely. Snorkeling is outstanding uncrowded beaches crystal clear water wonderful people!
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Busy but beautiful we did a couple day trips down there and went to Rolands Garden which is an absolute must!
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,This is a nice beach and the snorkeling off Governors beach area is well worth the swim out.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Beautiful beach! Stayed at Ritz where they have these great floating beds you can relax on. For a sunset though you have to walk south to Luca Restaurant. The sunset from here is amazing complete with palm trees. The sunset in front of the Ritz has the roped off area and lots of boats.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,We had heard that the beach here was beautiful but it exceeded our expectations. The turquoise water and nearly white sand beach was beautiful. We enjoyed walking up and down the beach each day. The waves were very calm making it an ideal beach for families with kids or snorkelers. We can't wait to go back.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Usually prefer to stay at 7 Mile Beach but $$$ Sunshine Suite is nice ($$)
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Great beach. Easy to get a bus to take you back to cruise ship. There are restuarants on the beach.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,golden sands clear waters fab reefs....awesome experience
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,A gorgeous beach - soft sand clear water safe for kids to play. Lots of places to eat and drink. Fun to watch people and dream about staying in one of the million dollar condos.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Great beach to walk no seaweed and the ocean is relatively warm.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,For a early morning stroll or a afternoon cocktail seven mile beach is just stunning.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,We like the long  on forever sandy beach and lack of crowds
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,There's not much to say really - its a really long beach nice white sand clear water and lots of places to hang out and eat on the beach...people from the States may be used to seeing beaches like this but having come from Africa it really was something else.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,What's not to like on Seven Mile Beach. Gorgeous warm blue water.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Loved every minute on the beach! Absolutely beautiful!
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,It was like no other beach you have seen before. It went on forever......
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,We loved everything about it. Great weather great tour guide. Awsome custom harley! Great mudslide nice ocean views. It was great
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,We enjoyed everything about Seen Mile Beach-very fine coral sand very clean great views lovely sea pines for shade. One of the best in the world!
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Lovely beach food and drinks along with changing room available at the public beach.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,I was there in January it wasn't too hot or too crowded. If you want a remote beach with just you and the palm fronds then Seven Mile Beach is not the place; however if you want a glorious beach just a few yards from your hotel then it can't be beaten.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Seven mile beach is wonderful. Talcum podwer sands cyrstal clear waters. Watersports galore
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Recently spent a few hours at Seven Mile Beach very nice great sand. Water a little chilly for water sports though.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,7 mile beach is very busy and hot! I prefer the other side of the island where there is more of a breeze where the Grand Caymanian Resort is...
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Great sand great water reefs within swimming distance GREAT sunsets. What else needs to be said?
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Love it dearly here. Beautiful Caribbean waters and white powder sand
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Stayed at Plantation Village (Timeshare). A great place to go if you want to relax and sit on the beach. Lot's of public beaches too. Close to the airport and shopping is fairly convenient. I recommend getting a car though.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,This is the most beautiful beach I have ever seen. I had a great time snorkeling and renting a Hobie Cat. I am looking forward to another trip there in 2013.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,We have been here before and it is just as beautiful as the first time...maybe even prettier!
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,We love relaxing on the beach here! The sand is awesome and the water is so beautiful and generally calm on this side of the island. Some places along Seven Mile have good snorkeling sites as well.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,what a beach breath taking seems to never end the absolute center piece of Grand Cayman the sunsets-unforgettable amazing
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Unfortunately the Cayman dollar is fixed. One U.S dollar is worth .80 cents Cayman. Wear a Rashguard or thin wet suit to protect your skin from the suns rays.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Lovely beach clear sea lots of fish for snorkelling! This is the hub of Grand Cayman for tourists swell as the beautiful beach there are lots of bars and restaurants around this strip.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Nice Beach but it seemed like we were dropped off at the very end just so the taxi driver could collect a max fare. I would walk to the beach if I had to do it again. The cruise ships tell you to get a cab but I think that was just a scam.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Simply the most beautiful beach I've ever seen with soft white sand and clear blue water! Very nice and relaxing as long as you avoid the places that the criuse ships drop people off to (i.e. Royal Palms).
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Nice beach but nothing exotic. Very clean and cannot complain but pretty much a quiet beach with nice sand and water. Good for families with small children.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Great beach but now totally given over to catering for the cruise ships in fact thats the way the whole island is going it seems. Shame!
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Have visited beaches all the around the world... one of the best.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Crystal clear water full of marine life and fine sand!
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Wow I this sums up 7MB the sand is white and fine the sea is that aqua blue and you can float on it ( don't drink the sea) its just one of those Wow places. Great place to view sunsets as they fully fill the sky.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Beautiful beach that is incredibly clean and picture perfect! We love that in Cayman there isn't anyone selling things to you while you are on your vacation! The water is so clear great for snorkeling and perfect as well for young children. We have been to many beaches and this is our favorite!
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,It is a spectacular beach clear blue water and soft sand.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Bring lots of sun screen and enjoy the best beach in the world.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,You can walk the beach for a few miles and when you get hot just run into the sea for a swim. It is a gradual drop off and you can go fairly far out without being over your head. For the more adventuresome snorkel to the far reefs and enjoy the sea life. Clear views to quite a depth.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,White sand calm turquoise seas. Quiet except for outside the main hotels.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,The Water is a crystal clear so amazing and the white sandy beach.. So breath taking.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,OK it is expensive to hire jet skis etc etc..but depends on what you want - great cafe's and bars on the beach and reasonable too
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,

g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Snorkeling Water Sports of all varieties excellent swimming beach combing and some of the best sunsets you will ever see!
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,This place is great. The Sea is warm and calm. You can wade in and see your feet on the bottom. The sunsets are amazing. Watching the sun drop into the water.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,This is the main tourist beach on Grand Cayman. Can get crowded. Lots of hotels from intermediate to high-end. Private homes (some for rental) and restaurants along the beach. Not a good place to surf but great for snorkeling and water activities such as sea kayaks paddle boards etc. Lots of scuba shops with shore and boat entry.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Sun Sand Ocean what is not to love! A beach chair overlooking the ocean ITunes going a good book. If you can't relax here than you need to jump on a dive boat and visit some of the great reefs off the beach them come back to the beach and repeat. You should be relaxed by then
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Had an excellent early morning run along the sandy beach with a dip in the ocean afterwards to cool off.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,You MUST stay on 7MB it's just paradise. Grab sunblock a towel a cocktail and just chill on the beach for a few hours with a good book. Nothing else will matter.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,

g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,A truly beautiful beach. Many places to visit along the West Bay Road. The water is crystal clear and inviting and we saw a few rays close in.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,We stayed in the East end so we were spoiled with the seclusion...however Seven mile Beach is beautiful it is a lot of hustle and bustly and not as relaxing as the East End. So if you are looking to party and nightlife this is the place for you...and the views are great too!
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,beautiful white sand beaches with some of the best snorkling I have ever done. I have been up and down this beach and haven't found a bad spot
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Nice beach but ordinary. Is missing something interesting just now is only one more Caribbean beach with clear sand and turquoise water.
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Very clean. Beautiful white sand. Gorgeous water who could ask for more?
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 29 2016,Such a beautiful beach! Has to be one of the most georgous beaches ever. its clean well kept. Snorkels beach chairs floats umbrellas for rent. The water is so clear...the fish so beautiful. peaceful.

g147367,d2385044,February 15 2016,You can never find a better beach than our seven mile beach!!! Just love to go on a Sunday and have a swim with my husband. Wonderful 345!!!!
g147367,d2385044,February 15 2016,This beach is really nice with clear water and nice sand. It's a very long beach where you can watch amazing sunsets. The only thing that this beach is missing which I would rate five stars are waves. It's a relatively calm beach.
g147367,d2385044,February 15 2016,its a nice beach the weather was not good when i was there but went for a few walks and there is a lot of things to do with motorised and unmotorised sports but like anything it doesnt come cheap
g147367,d2385044,February 15 2016,Lots of room clean sands gorgeous water and warm...a great place to relax and enjoy the scenery.A good day trip and of course to see the island. Lots of restaurants in the vicinity. A don't miss while on the island.
g147367,d2385044,February 15 2016,One of the most amazing beaches I've ever been to. Pristine beautiful warm water. Not much else you could ask for
g147367,d2385044,February 15 2016,I even saw a spotted ray and lots of beautiful fish. Not as good as a real snorkel trip but pretty decent. Food is expensive at beach restaurants s you might expect.
g147367,d2385044,February 15 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 15 2016,I didn't have much time here but got to take a long walk on this beach. As you walk along you see the plush resorts and the public beaches and beautiful beautiful water in many shades of blue.

g147367,d2385044,February 15 2016,Diving is wonderful. West Wall has the calmest seas in the world! Sea Turtles Moray Eels and lots of fish to see.
g147367,d2385044,February 15 2016,Beautiful clean beach! The water was crystal clear...only had an hour there because we were on a cruise and had limited amount of time.
g147367,d2385044,February 15 2016,A beautiful white soft sandy beach. Beautiful blue calm waters. The downside is everyone on the island goes here for those same reasons. It can get crowded. Did some snorkeling. Better areas for that by the Burger King and over by the cemetery. Many places to eat and drink along the beach.
g147367,d2385044,February 15 2016,Unbelievable diving just off 7 mile beach will be destroyed to build giant cruise ship docks that will take away the one competitive advantage Grand Cayman has had over other Caribbean Islands : great unspoiled diving. I have been told that the the reefs will not survive this unless something is done to intervene.
g147367,d2385044,February 15 2016,Long sandy beach calm clear water. You can't ask for better. Access to public beaches is available if you are not staying in a beachfront hotel.
g147367,d2385044,February 15 2016,Fab place very relaxing and clean. There are bars and restaurants near by. When we arrived it was pouring with rain but it cleared within 5 minutes and the fresh sea air helped with the heat. Would definitely go back!
g147367,d2385044,February 15 2016,The sand and the water were jut awesome! We stayed at the Renaissance and that section of the beach was quiet and very private.
g147367,d2385044,February 15 2016,One of the nicest beaches I've been to in the Caribbean. White sand generally not very crowded gorgeous clear water and calm surf. I spent hours each day enjoying the view and pristine water.
g147367,d2385044,February 15 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 15 2016,If you really want to swim in a crystal "green" water step over a sand like a flour see corals and incredible fishes just 80-100 meters far in the water - this is the right place for you.

g147367,d2385044,March 12 2016,Absolutely beautiful beach has a few rocks but you can still get in the views are amazing absolutely loved it
g147367,d2385044,March 11 2016,It was the best beach in Grand Cayman; however I gave it a four out of five stars just because it wasn't my favorite beach in the world. If you are going to Grand Cayman you should stay on this beach.

g147367,d2385044,March 9 2016,Loved the Marriott where we stayed but the beach itself was very narrow. Water was gorgeous though.
g147367,d2385044,March 9 2016,water is amazing everywhere on the island Don't miss the giant tarponswimming by the shore in George town
g147367,d2385044,March 9 2016,One of the best beaches in the world! Deep powdery sand a gentle breeze and the bluest clearest water you ever hope to find!
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,This was the best beach...clear water and powdery sand you can't ask for anything better. The water is calm and relaxing. Go snorkeling at many of the accessible spots such as chesseburger reef. Such a great place!
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,What do you think of when you think Cayman beaches. "Seven Mile Beach" You at least have to say you've been there. It's very commercialized. But there our places that are a little secluded you just have to find them.

g147367,d2385044,March 11 2016,It was the best beach in Grand Cayman; however I gave it a four out of five stars just because it wasn't my favorite beach in the world. If you are going to Grand Cayman you should stay on this beach.

g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,This was the best beach...clear water and powdery sand you can't ask for anything better. The water is calm and relaxing. Go snorkeling at many of the accessible spots such as chesseburger reef. Such a great place!
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,What do you think of when you think Cayman beaches. "Seven Mile Beach" You at least have to say you've been there. It's very commercialized. But there our places that are a little secluded you just have to find them.

g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,very beautiful place very long walk away from the car park tho. It was very relaxing to sit and watch the kids play. Seen a few persons keeping birthday parties there was very kool :)
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,Very clear waters. Can get in safely anywhere and put your snorkel and fins on. Or just walk the beach one end to the other. Very easy walk. No sales people to hassle you. It is just you the beach and the sun..

g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,This beach is full of rocks and high waves. They were charging 8USD per chair and 15USD for an umbrella. The service was the only thing that was ok.

g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,Great beach. Just crowded the days the cruise ships were in port. Calm waters but sand is not soft. Some areas had lots of shells and rocks. So take care when entering the water.
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,It doesn't get any better than this. No wonder SMB was named Worlds Most Beautiful Beach. It really is.
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,It is true: Seven Mile Beach is a winner possibly surpassing Varadero Beach in Cuba. Sand is white and soft. The water is clear and warm. I walked for over an hour and at times had the beach to myself. A great experience!
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,Crystal clear water! Fish galore! Shells! Calm and gentle water! just perfect! I totally understand now why this is rated as one of the top beaches in the world!
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,beautiful beach great sunsets no crowds nice people very safe soft sand low waves 85 degree water lots of sunshine
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,If you are a beach sort of person then Seven Mile Beach is fine. Most of the beach is taken up with the private hotel areas but you can walk freely along the waterline. And there are many public areas as well.
g147367,d2385044,March 13 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 13 2016,On sunny and low wind days the water is so clear and beautiful greens/blues colors. Beach is fine - certainly better depending on the spot. Not huge from an ocean to property distance standpoint. Seems like public beach spots have trash leftover. A must do in Cayman.
g147367,d2385044,March 12 2016,Absolutely beautiful beach has a few rocks but you can still get in the views are amazing absolutely loved it
g147367,d2385044,March 11 2016,It was the best beach in Grand Cayman; however I gave it a four out of five stars just because it wasn't my favorite beach in the world. If you are going to Grand Cayman you should stay on this beach.
g147367,d2385044,March 11 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 10 2016,If you just want to relax on the beach this is the place to do it see Ron and Janet to get chairs umbrellas snorkel gear and they even take people on the banana boat. Enjoy one of the best beaches in the world.
g147367,d2385044,March 9 2016,Loved the Marriott where we stayed but the beach itself was very narrow. Water was gorgeous though.
g147367,d2385044,March 9 2016,water is amazing everywhere on the island Don't miss the giant tarponswimming by the shore in George town
g147367,d2385044,March 9 2016,One of the best beaches in the world! Deep powdery sand a gentle breeze and the bluest clearest water you ever hope to find!
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,This was the best beach...clear water and powdery sand you can't ask for anything better. The water is calm and relaxing. Go snorkeling at many of the accessible spots such as chesseburger reef. Such a great place!
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,What do you think of when you think Cayman beaches. "Seven Mile Beach" You at least have to say you've been there. It's very commercialized. But there our places that are a little secluded you just have to find them.

g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,Seven mile beach is a vast stretch of beach and I can only speak to the section around the Westin. The beach is certainly beautiful but underwhelming if you want to snorkel. We snorkeled at Governors beach. The reef is minimal and not that healthy. There are some fish but it isn't that impressive.
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,Clear water and soft sand with ample space to lay out and swim. Various water/motor sports are available from different vendors and easy access from the hotels all along the beach. While Seven Mile is the most well-known on the island Governor's just north is a little more pristine.
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,7 Mile Beach is an excellent stretch of beach with many hotels and bars along the way. The sea is a beautiful azure blue and crystal clear and the sand is a beautiful color. Excellent venue.
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,Beautiful beach but not great snorkeling. We stayed at the Westin which was pricey but the beach was amazing. Everyday we swam in the beach or kayaked. Definitely very touristy beach and always really busy.
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,Very few rocks. White sand. Oodles of swim area. No sea weed. Not overly crowded. Loved every minute. Lots of public access areas.
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,The beauty of Seven Mile beach is outstanding but if you are not staying in any of the hotels on the Seven Mile beach you can only access it from the main street. The water is calm and shallow. Just a relaxing stop. 3 stars only because there is limited public beach access.
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,The best place in our cruise. Wonderfull people beach fish and all the thing you do in this places is incredible
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,This has to be the most beautiful beach that I have seen. I've not seen many but this would be hard to beat. Can be a bit crowded especially when multiple cruise ships are in the area.
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,Great for kids!!!! Plus there are toys for adults such as Jet Skis kayaks paddle boards etc. Good access via the local buses. Water is super for swimming since it is very salty.

g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,What do you think of when you think Cayman beaches. "Seven Mile Beach" You at least have to say you've been there. It's very commercialized. But there our places that are a little secluded you just have to find them.
g147367,d2385044,March 13 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 13 2016,On sunny and low wind days the water is so clear and beautiful greens/blues colors. Beach is fine - certainly better depending on the spot. Not huge from an ocean to property distance standpoint. Seems like public beach spots have trash leftover. A must do in Cayman.
g147367,d2385044,March 12 2016,Absolutely beautiful beach has a few rocks but you can still get in the views are amazing absolutely loved it
g147367,d2385044,March 11 2016,It was the best beach in Grand Cayman; however I gave it a four out of five stars just because it wasn't my favorite beach in the world. If you are going to Grand Cayman you should stay on this beach.
g147367,d2385044,March 11 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 10 2016,If you just want to relax on the beach this is the place to do it see Ron and Janet to get chairs umbrellas snorkel gear and they even take people on the banana boat. Enjoy one of the best beaches in the world.
g147367,d2385044,March 9 2016,Loved the Marriott where we stayed but the beach itself was very narrow. Water was gorgeous though.
g147367,d2385044,March 9 2016,water is amazing everywhere on the island Don't miss the giant tarponswimming by the shore in George town

g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,This is by far the nicest beach I've ever been to anywhere in the world. Wow... water is crystal clear sand is white and clean and the people are very friendly. Love it
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,The beach was nice with calm waters and no drop-off even hundreds of feet from shore. Decent snorkeling. Very busy and very pricey. If you are going to spend significant time here get a cabana to prevent your stuff from getting trampled.
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,7 mile beach is an absolutely beautiful stretch of sand! Very clean little to no seaweed areas to sit in shade when need be....absolutely wonderful!!!
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,This is the greatest beach. Clear aqua water. There is plenty of activities at the hotels beach front. We are coming again.
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,Great for swimming and for long walks! Highly recommend spending time visiting or if possible staying in a condo on the beach.
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,We are staying on seven mile beach. We normally come to grand cayman on cruise ships but wanted to stay this time. It's a beautiful area and very close to town and shopping. If you stay here remember that tbe stores close on sunday so no grocery stores are open.
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,Just returned from our first visit but hopefully not the last! We traveled during the slower time which meant at times feeling like we had the beach to ourselves! So clean/pristine/safe! nothing like the touristy USA beaches we visited!
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,Not only is this beach clean and the water beautiful but there are vendors for chairs and umbrellas. Very laid back. Going back today.
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,Great beach to swim snorkel paddle board or just relax. Can get very crowded at times depending the time you go. I was there in September and the beach was practically empty :)
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,Very nice beach and crystal clear water without waves. Very busy very commercialized with lots of water craft. Quiet peaceful beach it was not.
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,Beautiful soft white sand beach with bright clear water. Peaceful strip to walk along. Less beachside bars/ restaurants than I expected. Mostly hotels along strip so a quiet stroll.
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,It is a well maintained and good looking beach with white sand and public access. However it is also almost identical to the many white sand beaches on a gulf coast of Florida. The architecture the vibe and pretty much everything else can be had in the States for much cheaper.
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,Crystal Clear water and soft sand. The crowds can be a bit much but still a great beach. Go a bit south for a little more privacy
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,One of the most beautiful beaches we've discovered. The sand is white and the seaweed is cleaned up daily. We could see people in the water from our bedroom from their heads to their toes as the water was so clear. It was calm like a swimming pool and very serene.
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,I visited this beach in Oct even with the weather being off we enjoyed every bit of it. Clean and easy to access
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,Seven Mile Beach is a wonderful place to spend a relaxing vacation. White powdery sand blue green water and gentle waves. There are great restaurants and bars. Wonderful vacation spot.
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,Its very expensive area but the water is nice and warm the surf is gentle and there are restaurants and pubs and everything you want in the area.
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,Seven Mile Beach in Grand Cayman is spectacular. The white sand is pristine and the clear blue water and reefs offer great snorkeling.
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,On seven mile beach some of the best snorkeling is at cemetery reef. Water is clear with lots of coral reef . Don't miss it.
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,Of all the beaches and waters I´ve seen the seven mile beach and the Cayman waters is definitely the most beautiful!
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,Enjoyed our stay at condo #31 the closest to the water on Seven Mile Beach. Snorkeling reef within 75 feet of our door. Beautiful sunsets every night it doesn't get better.
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,Honestly one of the best beaches in the world. If you're not staying at a resort at the beach there are several restaurants and public options for chair and umbrella rental (Royal Palms is one) and long walks on the beach cannot be missed!
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,I have been to many Caribbean beaches and this by far is the BEST. You cannot beat the water or the cuisine. It is not much of a party town but if you are looking for a laid-back beautiful home away from home with great restaurants and people this is it he place to go.
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,Beautiful beach with snorkeling right along the shoreline. When in the Cayman's you must go to Stingray City! It is a must!
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,People watching sunsets turquoise waters family and friends - what else is there? Oh ya! Maybe an island cocktail!!
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,I've visited the Seven Mile Beach 3 times and each time I experienced clear water and beautiful sandy beaches...This is perfect if you want to spend your entire day being a beach bum or enjoying the water sports and restaurants.
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,There are no words other than wow fab beautiful. This was exactly what we had envisioned as a tropical paradise beach. Sheer bliss
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,Beautiful beach. Water has a lot of rocks in it but the most amazing sunsets. It's really 7 miles of Beach. The water was very warm but not as clear as I thought it would be. But overall it's a beautiful vacation spot.
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,How can you not LOVE this beach ! Its views are endless beach is clean  sun is warm and so is the water !
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,It's Seven Mile Beach...the only thing to dislike about this beach is when you have to leave and go home! I fell in love with the beach during a cruise back in 2006 when it was one of our stops. I was hooked right there!! Beautiful water and amazing sunsets can you ask for more? :)

g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,One of the nicest beaches we have been to. Sand is clean and beautiful and the water is crystal clear blue. Plenty of spots to grab a beer or two and finding public transportation back to the cruise port is not an issue.
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,If you want to see an amazing sunset look no further. Some of the best views in the world. The beach is clean and welcoming. Most hotels have bars or places to sit and watch the sunset.
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,Must see the Sunset every night from the Westin. You can pull up a chair and sit and enjoy...... relish in the most relaxing vacation you could ever have.
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,My partners parents live right on seven mile beach so we've taken advantage of it on several occasions the beach is normally moderately crowded but it's not hard to find silence to relax if you keep away from hotel fronts it's fairly clean and the water is great depth for snorkeling or just swimming around.
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,We walked up and down this beautiful stretch of beach daily. The only vacation I have been on that we have butch actually lost weight and enjoyed doing it.
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,On a scale from 1 to 10 it rates 11. You ca have fun music and games at the public beach and tranquility else where on the island
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,Really exceptional beach white sand and crystal clear water. Easy to snorkel right on the beach saw lots of fish and a few sting rays. Just lovely.
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,This has to be the best beach I have ever been too. I am lucky enough to walk it every morning and night with the dog and spend time with the wife at the weekends!
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,We went during hurricane joquain so although we were still far away we still had some bad seas for the first few days with some seaweed washed ashore. after that passed the real beauty of the beach came out. crystal blue waters and fine sand. Nice
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,Seven Mile Beach is beautiful with crystal clear waters. The sand is very light and soft. Very clean. Nearby hotel rents out beach chairs for $8. It only cost $2 to get onto the beach. Saw many fish!
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,I've been going to Grand Cayman for 25+ years. My favorite place to stay is the Westin because it has the best private beach.
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,Most Beautiful Beach ever! Water is so clean and clear. Walked every day. Wish I lived there. Most friendliest beach and people. Never had to worry about what time you were out walking or swimming.
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,It's a beautiful beach with beautiful sand but the sea grass is destroying the beauty of this beach. It's so sad that its happening and they don't know why it's happening. The hotels and resorts try to clean the sea grass as much as possible but it is overbearing when you're trying to get in the water.
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,We came right in the middle of the stormthe sea was angry my friend the sun didn't come out much..so we got cancelled 2 days later the stingray fun but no rum tour. .all in one ...i don't think i be back
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,Royal Palm Resort in Grand Cayman Island has beautiful water and a nice beach located along the Seven Mile Beach
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,This beach is unbelievable. Its 7 miles of crystal clear blue waters. Its wonderful to just walk it or you can swim and enjoy warm water.
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,Beautiful beach awesome snorkeling sunsets and the most amazing colored water. Wear sunscreen!!!!!
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,Simply put one of the top 2 or 3 beaches I have visited. The sand is soft the water is clear. Plenty of spots to relax snorkel swim or even places to rent equipment to get on the water.
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,My husband and I had the most amazing time on Seven Mile Beach! The sand is beautiful and the water is so clear and such a pleasure to be in.
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,If you go to Grand Cayman either by cruise or staying there you must go to and stay on 7 mile beach. The water is calm and crystal clear. The sand is incredibly white and we just love 7 mile beach. We have stayed in GC 5 times all on 7 mile beach.
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,I love this beach. Great sandy bottom clear water and very warm. I recommend sitting in front of the Governor's House but "respect the Governor's privacy" as the signs say.
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,Great beach that is a must when on Grand Cayman. Easy to walk with beach front restaurants and bars. Sunsets are amazing.
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,This was my first visit and I found this beach to be spectacular. I swam snorkeled jet skiied read walked photographed and feel so lucky to have experienced the beauty that I have only seen in pictures. Spending time on this calm gorgeous beach is unforgettable. I never wanted to leave.
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,White Powder Sand Crystal clear blue water. Very little waves. Heaven on earth. Suitable for all ages. The day we arrived in the first two minutes after my son got in the water he said "Oh we are coming back here again!" He has been to most caribbean islands!
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,Seven mile beach is beautiful! Not to crowded walking distance to just about everything you need. Sun fun and relaxing!
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,Beautiful Beach and lots of bars and restaurants. The Ritz was gorgeous and classy. The Spa at the Ritz was out of this world. The little bar at Comfort Suites was cute and fun. The ice bar downtown was amazing. Great 2 day trip.
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,We stayed at the Marriott and WOW they have really got it going on! They have created a reef in the back of their property you can snorkel around it and see some beautiful fish. A highlight for me was swimming with HUGE parrotfish - like 15-20 of them. A beautiful beach and great atmosphere.
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,Seven Mile beach is powdery sand the clearest water imaginable with 100 foot visibility. Excellent for a morning walk with breathtaking views! The water temperature is above 80 degrees year around! Perfection!!
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,Stunning sunsetsgolden sands and clear crystal waters free from seaweed! The waters are still in the morning and so perfect for swimming. No sharks here or at least not known in these waters!
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,Seven Mile Beach is the longest beach at Grand Cayman: It is mainly populated by hotels....If you prefer a smaller and often way more beautiful beach head out to Smiths Beach...only a 10 minute drive from Seven Mile Beach
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,White sand beach . Clean and close to all attractions and George town. I arrived via Carnival Cruise line. This is so easy to get to without having to find it as it is next to George town. You can see the ships from the beach
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,Nicest beach ever! Powdery sand crystal blue water and the snorkeling right off the beach is wonderful. Go to Cemetery Reef Governors Reef and the best place - Eden Rock accessible from Eden Rock Dive Shop.
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,There are no words to describe how beautiful the beach is!!! We are looking forward to coming back!!
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,March 8 2016,While our the amphibious bus land and sea tour we were let off at the seven mile beach for about 30 minutes. Although I live and work near the beach the water and sand is much more beautiful!
g147367,d2385044,February 27 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 27 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 26 2016,This beach is miles of beautiful views and white sand beach. Can see the cruise ships in the harbor and many boating an water activities.
g147367,d2385044,February 26 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 25 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 24 2016,Clean safe and never a bad view 7 mile beach is fantastic. Stay to the North end of the beach (Ritz Carlton and up) to avoid the cruise shippers who descend upon the areas closest to Georgetown.
g147367,d2385044,February 24 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 24 2016,Seven mile beach is a beautiful clean beach with safe swimming for all ages snorkeling areas the public beach has a children's playground and covered areas with a bar nearby
g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,This long stretch of beach is dotted with hotels beach clubs and condominium complexes. You can also find public access areas that allow you to enjoy the beach for practically no charge. In some areas on calm days you can actually snorkel just 50 yards off shore.
g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,We stayed on the quiet end of 7 mile beach and it was gorgeous and peaceful. There was great snorkeling just on the beach.
g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,Warm crystal clear water and miles of soft sand ideal for a walk. Evenings are also a highlight as the sun sets after another perfect day.
g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,Sting Ray City and Sandbar. Cemetery reef. Botanical gardens. Eden Rock. Smiths Barcadero. Rum point.
g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,7 mile beach is beautiful with white sands and plenty of seating. Do know that it has some rocky entrances and several of the chairs are for hotel guests only. It's a great way to spend the day snorkeling and watching the unbelievable sunsets.
g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,Everything was great white sand beaches and crystal clear water. The sun is very intense giving you an instant tan so be careful!
g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,Most beautiful beach I have visited in the Caribbean second to Trunk Bay in St. Johns! Warm calm water. Perfect white sand. Loads of fish to snorkel for or just observe from the surface!
g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,What could be prettier than Seven Mile Beach? The water is so clear & calm-great for kids & water sports!
g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,The white soft sand. The calm clear waveless water. What more could you ask for? The beach is very walkable and quiet off season (October).
g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,We snorkeled around the coral reef off 7 mile beach near Tiki Resort. The fish were plentiful and colorful and they were not afraid of our presence. The water temps were perfect in September and the local people we encountered were very warm and friendly. Taxi ride to the beach and back was reasonable.
g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,Crystal clear waters on a perfect beach. Warm waters and great views. Be sure to remember your sunscreen though - the sun is pretty intense.
g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,A beautiful stretch of white sand beach with coral reefs within easy swimming distance from the beach.
g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,Beautiful clear blue water among the clearest we've seen anywhere...and lots of activities. We have heard it can get very crowded when cruise ships are in town but it was sparsely populated during our four day visit in September.

g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,Seven mile beach is a beautiful crystal clear non-crowded beach. Not many shells but lots of white coral. Great island experience.
g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,We go every year with Fantasea Tours-Capt. Dexter!!! Small boat-intimate experience. Not a "cattle call" feel with bigger boats. He's such a delight loves the sting rays and wants their safety first! I wouldn't go with anyone else.
g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,Amazing Pristine Calm water!! Crystal Clear and zero waves - perfect for little kids!! The water was unbelievably calm - with zero waves. Sand is so soft it feels like sugar!

g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,Definitely for snorkeling of diving. The water is pristine and the sand soft. If it is just for the beach and the water I have enjoyed other beaches a bit more. The people are friendly and the food was ok. Because of the exchange rate you are paying 20 percent more for everything
g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,This is the most beautiful beach with bright clear blue water soft cool white sand and calm waters!

g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,We used the beach away from the hotels. It was some type of park close to a new hotel being erected. You could just float and there was enough fish to snorkel. Weekends crowded.
g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,Paradise...relaxing convenient welcoming..what vacation is ALL about! Whether renting a car or walking feel very safe. We LOVE Seven Mile Beach!

g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,I had a very enjoyable day at the beach(Cemetary Beach). Did some snorkeling and had a picnic under some shade trees. There are no facilities so bring your own refreshments. Very pleasant experience.
g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,Stunning. Seven miles of absolute perfection. White sand beautiful blue water. This has to be the best island in the caribbean. I dream of returning to this beach.
g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,Nice beach! A bit rockier than other Caribbean beaches but the water was warm. The cute fish in the water don't bother you. My BFF and I stayed in the water well after sun down and the water was just wonderful!

g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,We could snorkel right out front of our hotel.... Comfort Inn Seven Mile beach water is the clearest I have ever seen!!!

g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,We always stay on northern Seven Mile Beach -- the quieter end. In off season you share the beach with very few people at your condo. World class water and world class sandy beach. Decent snorkeling. You need a car if you are on the northern third of the beach.
g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,Clear turquoise water smooth sand. Excellent snorkelling swimming and relaxing. Beautiful sunsets. Just gorgeous!

g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,The most beautiful beach and water I've seen in my travels thus far. Water so clear you have to remind yourself not to drink it. Sand so soft is like powder. Not crowded even during cruise ship days. You cannot beat 7-mile beach.

g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,Beautiful but busy beach (especially when a cruise ship is in port). Try Royal Palms for an inexpensive visit $2.
g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,Seven Mile Beach was a beautiful beach with calm clear water. Its the perfect place to relax on the beach snorkel out to see all the colorful fish get great cuisine off the shore and go shopping on rainy days or when you don't want that much sun. Overall it has everything you want in a beach.
g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,Clear water clean beach. Not a lot of crazy activity going on. Great to chill and relax and wade in water.
g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,We've been to numerous beaches in Mexico Jamaica Dominican Republic St. Croix Florida Maryland North and South Carolina Hawaii. The waters here are so clear. The beaches are soft white sands. It's one of the top three beaches we've ever been too. If you dream of clear water and soft white sands. You need to come here.

g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,the quality of the water and the snorkeling . the variety of fishes turtles make this beach one of the best in the world
g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,The 7 mile beach has crystal clear water and average temp is about 85 degrees. There are a few rocks just as you enter the water so water shoes for kids are recommended but the rocks stop about 2 feet in. Small wave action but you can see the fish swim around your feet. Roy & Doris CS
g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,The beach is abs outlet breath taking and the sea is so warm and perfect for a swim and definitely a snorkel!

g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,The focal point for most of our holiday The clear blue water sandy beach.... PARADISE... Would recommend to everyone
g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,The sand was the softest sand I have ever felt in my life and the water was so beautiful it looked fake. I want to go back! If you are going to Grand Cayman there is no other beach you should go to other than Seven Mile Beach.
g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,Beautiful beaches and incredible snorkeling. The sunsets were amazing. We went in mid august and it wasn't crowded or busy. Reefs were right off the beaches and awesome fish for viewing. Bring your snorkles
g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,Best beach in the world and I have been to quite a few. Great sand and great water. Will definitely be going back!

g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,7 Mile Beach is the place where the majority of tourist go with a variety of hotels right on the beach. Most have restaurants on site and all have beach access. The sunsets are amazing!
g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,This beach was the most amazing beach I have visited. The temperature is always perfect and the sea life was plentiful. There were hardly any rocks to speak of or seaweed in this area. The tide was gentle and the smell was clean and fresh.
g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,The beach was gorgeous and the water phenomenal. The waves were perfect and the gentle breeze made getting into the water exhilarating.
g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,Beautiful beach. Calm seas and beautiful water. Uncrowded where we were staying. No sargassum. Great snorkeling.
g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,We stayed at the Westin right on Seven Mile Beach. It was a beautiful beach with snorkeling readily available. We loved everything about it!
g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,The beach is pristine. The water is clear and blue and the weather was perfect. Grand Caymen is a beautiful place to visit. The prices are a little high overall but what do you expect when your paradise. This beach was perfect and clean.
g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,This was a day full of fun. Enjoy a day at the beach or just relax under an umbrella and enjoy the scenery. If you are an adventurous person there is so much for you! Don't miss this must see!
g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,We were there about 20 years ago and the beach is just a beautiful. White sand clear water. You can snorkel right off the beach. Watch for beach access signs or better yet stay at one of the hotels and enjoy umbrellas and chairs.
g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,It was beautiful beach but vendors for Everything but expected!! Rented chairs and umbrellas. Next time we will go further away from the crowds. Food and drinks are expensive. But it was beautiful!!
g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,Very nice beach. It was quite hyped up to me so I was a bit disappointed in the quality of the beach. It is definitely a beautiful beach but I have been to better. My first visit to Grand Cayman and this beach was very nice probably won't be back anytime soon but overall nice place to visit.
g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,This is one the nicest beaches I have visited. There is no grit to the sand--it's like a very fine powder. The water is warm and clear. Snorkeling off the beach right in front of the Marriot we saw so many fish and even a turtle!
g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,The most beautiful beach and water I have ever seen. My husband is super particular about beaches as he wants white sand and clear water and this is one of the very few beaches he likes. This beach needs to be on everyone's Bucket List!
g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,Beautiful clear water. Soft white sand beach. You can snorkel right off the beach as they have a man made reef
g147367,d2385044,February 23 2016,An excellent beach for lounging snorkeling and swimming. The place is exceptionally great when the cruise ship crowd is light. You can also go to several public beaches that are less crowded and very accessible. Cemetery Beach was a place we stopped at a couple of times.
g147367,d2385044,February 22 2016,Seven Mile Beach is the main reason to go to Grand Cayman. Pure white sand - pleasant current - and many areas to access public beach locations. The water is spotlessly clean as is the sand.
g147367,d2385044,February 22 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 22 2016,Enjoyed our trip to Grand Cayman. Second time there and we will be back. Beach is clean and family friendly.
g147367,d2385044,February 22 2016,Beautiful beach. Grand Cayman Beach Suites is the perfect busy-ness level. Not dead not too crowded
g147367,d2385044,February 22 2016,You can't go wrong here. The Water is beautiful there are plenty of activities or you can do nothing at all. Very relaxing.
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,Seven Mile Beach is a nice Caribbean beach. However when cruise ships coming into port it can be very crowded. And over the years it seems to be coming worse. It is a great beach to watch the sunset. However if you are looking for a quiet secluded photo-worthy Caribbean beach this is NOT it.
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,Great beach although I wish it were a bit wider so that there would be more space for kids to play and to build sand castles etc
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,A great beach...one of the best ever...great to walk along and then stop and have a drink along the way ! a must for a visit to Grand Cayman
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,Crystal clear warm water and a very enjoyable time just floating around in the ocean. We spent a week on the Cayman's mostly diving but would relax at the beach in the evening.
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,I have never been anywhere in the world where the water has been so calm and clear. The closes might be Costa Smeralda Sardegna Italy. We saw Stingray's and Sea Turtles during our swimming. Jet skis Ocean Kayak Para-sail Paddle Boards floats etc... All available from the hotel fronts.
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,We went on a friday with no cruise ships anchored (minus 11000 tourists!). The water is crystal clear and the sand was the finest and easy to walk
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,My favorite beach in the Caribbean. Snorkeling is awesome. You can relax and get away from any crowds or you can hang out in the thick of things. Great bars and restaurants along the beach.
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,Beautiful white sand beach and sparkling clear water. There are plenty of activities available as well as plenty of places to just relax.
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,White soft sand and a sea turtles kept me company all day! Spent a few hours swimming in the clear water with my buddy the baby sea turtle. Great day.
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,Love this area. Beautiful friendly and fun. Loved everything about this island. The people are the nicest.
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,Prestine water. Lots of sun. Quiet beach. White sand. Water sports. We saw and experienced it all on Seven-Mile Beach. Plus off the beach about 200 yards we snorkled around a vibrant reef. Hundreds of fish...and a lobter! Shop around for water sports rentals. Some of the larger ones tend to be far more expensive than others on the beach.
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,I go to the beach on a regular basis. Love my island. The beach is always clean many cabanas for shade and restrooms for showers. No hassle of vendor.
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,Great beach good selection of water sport and activities. I didn't participate in any as we were travelling on the Ruby Princess and had enough of the sea and surf by this stage of our holiday ..
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,Clean Clear water great beach. Don't stay anywhere else on the Island or you will be disappointed.Close to many fine hotels and restaurants.
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,We stayed at the Westin on Seven Mile Beach - I would say it has the best beach on the Island. The beach is so beautiful and the water is crystal clear. It was like being in heaven. I would love to return in the near future
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,Here's a beach that lives up to its reputation. Just fantastic for walking and bar-hopping snorkeling and beautiful sunsets. Loved every minute of our time there!
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,Gorgeous clean beach with no one bothering you to buy anything. Soft white sand and plenty of activities.
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,One of the best beaches I've seen in my travels. Snorkeling right from the shore sand is very soft and clean.
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,Very expensive incredibly crowded and the snorkling is mediocre at best. Grab a tour right off of the pier They are cheaper than the Cruise ships tours and roughly go to the same places. The Seven Mile beach is just that a beach nothing special and not worth your day
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,7 Mile Beach is the absolute best beach I've ever been on. Crystal clear water 40 yards away (probably more). Even if your not staying at one of the resorts you can walk the whole beach.
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,This beach is beautiful much better then the hotel. Very peaceful and relaxing not to many beach goers which was perfect for me.
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,None of us had fun. It was boring. Everything was pricey other than the food and drinks if u get the all inclusive package. So I would not suggest going here.
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,This is such a beautiful beach. The water is crystal clear and it is a beautiful swim or walk. The snorkeling is not very impressive although there are a couple of decent spots.
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,Just beautiful. Clean clear green waters. Felt so very safe. Would go back in a heart beat.... Seem like a lot of people yet never felt crowded.
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,The warm clear water. The soft sand that doesn't heat up in the sun. Miles of beach...what's not to love about this beach. Understandable why this is ranked as one of the world's best.
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,Have been to many Caribbean beaches. All of them were great  but Seven Mile beach was the best . The clearest blue water and soft sand.
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,Excellent beach - as good as any you will find on the globe. Clear warm water gentle waves sand is white and powdery.
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,This was a place where all the amenities where just like home. The island is beautiful with plenty of things to see. We spent the day on seven mile beach and had a marvelous time. I will definately go back and will recommend other to visit as well. WOW
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,Best Beach Ever! Lots of activities right on the beach however if you call other places they will pick you up and the prices are cheaper ex. scuba diving etc... The water is amazing the sand is so soft.
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,This is a beautiful safe place that has a hotel to suit everyone. Some are big lots of chairs people etc. Others are small and quiet. One end of the beach is qieter then other. Water is beautiful.
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,Beautiful beach and nice way to spend the day. Limited on food and drink so plan ahead and bring your own.

g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,We came here while on a Carnival Cruise and spent the whole day on this beach. There are many water sports available including jetski kayak volleyball etc. Also there were bars on the beach with fair prices. We recommend coming to this beach if passing by the Caymans. Definitely a MUST!
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,We were staying on the East End but spent an afternoon on 7MB. For those looking to do the beach without a hotel just head to Governor's Area right next to the Westin. There is public parking access to the beach and shade! Perfect way to spend an afternoon!

g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,Sand like powder and crystal clear water. This was the best beach I have visited. There were abundant water sports vendors right on the beach.
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,Beautiful Beach! Pristine sand aquamarine water very little to no wave action at all crystal clear water.
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,Very nice beach. We went there as part of an excursion and weren't there to long but it was clean and roomy. We then went to Stingray City and spent time in the water with the Stingrays.
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,Soft sand clear warm turquoise water gorgeous sunsets...can't help loving this beach! It is great for swimming water sports or just a lovely walk.
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,Long beautiful beach which is clean with white sand. You feel safe with plenty of room on the beach if you stay in one of the condos. The water is clear and in most areas you can snorkel. Wouldn't think of staying anywhere else.
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,This is beautiful but watch out if you trek it alone and not from the ship. They charge for chairs ($10-20 per day). We walked back instead of taking a taxi. It was long but fun.
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,

g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,Nice walking on the beach. Lots of things the sea landward and seaward. Sea turtles too. A nice place to walk and see all the sights..
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,Best beach for swimming and water sports!! Its got everything anyone could want/need for a good beach day!!
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,Gorgeous beach with calm and shallow water. We went to several other beaches to snorkel but liked seven mile the best. Since the water is so calm you can do lots of water sports: paddle boarding kayaking sailing water cycle etc. I strongly recommend booking a hotel on seven mile beach.
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,I have only been on the beach of 2 resorts here but both are incredibly beautiful with clear blue water and white sand.
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,We stayed at The Anchorage at the north end of Seven Mile Beach. It was quiet; beautiful white sand; gorgeous green and blue water; good for snorkeling; could see huge turtles swim by. Some areas have large rocks & other areas sand. Great to walk.
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,Nice sandy beach. Beautiful scenery. Plenty of activities to do we just decided to relax and enjoy the warm weather.
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,A very quick visit many years ago but my main recollection is of the pastel coloured buildings behind the beach. Beautiful and idyllic
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,The water is warm and crystal clear. The waves were mi I always making paddle boarding a breeze. The water is fairly shallow for a long way. It is a. Great family beach.
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,Loved 7 Mile Beach! We found a parking spot down a side street and walked over. Crystal clear water and a wonderful spot to watch the sunset!
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,This is a breathtaking beach with lots of fun and excitement! We enjoyed staying at the quieter end towards Governor's beach. It was fun to watch families jump aboard jet ski's banana boat rides jet skis etc. Couldn't help but enjoy the calm waters of SMB while soaking in the sun in the sugary sand.
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,Seven Mile Beach was beautiful! However if you are not staying directly on the Beach is was difficult to find a place to hang. The resorts had security and they would as you to move. They had many activities so you would be able to do anything you would like. Scuba snorkel parasailing boat rides etc.
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,Beach is nice but not very wide. They put lots of chairs out. They also have free rafts in ocean but first come.
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,Seven Mile Beach is one of the most beautiful beaches you will ever see. The sand  crystal clear water and the gentle breezes make this beach a perfect place for a walk water activities sunbathing or just hanging out. The weather is perfect all year round- it is simply paradise!
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,Amazing sand and crystal clear water. My friends and I visited the beach areas in West Bay and can't say enough wonderful things!
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,Clean long beach. Exactly what you'd imagine from a Caribbean beach though a little crowded. Dotted with several restaurants bars and resorts. Not a hint of authentic or "secret spot" feel. More touristy but nice none-the-less.
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,The beach had beautiful white sand and clean blue water! The water was shallow and fairly calm. The Ritz-Carlton staff was awesome!
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,This is absolutely perfect. The cleanest sand and blue blue water this is the most beautiful setting on a stunning island. There are shops and restaurants just behind the beach too. You must try the coconut rum cake in. Grand Cayman. So good! I'd also recommend going to see the turtles. All in a great experience.
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,I loved my experience on Seven Mile Beach through the Ritz Carlton. I was able to lay in sun while having incredible experience on a kayak sailing as well as snorkeling. The water was crystal clear.
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,Clean beach clear water no peddlers. Our favorite beach! Snorkeling available right off the beach cemetery beach was our favorite.
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,Best beach on the planet - as long as you stay away from the giant hotels like the Ritz with their congested beaches.
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,seven mile beach is beautiful and filled with things to do so grab a towel and get wet!! float or para sail it truly is serene
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,This beach is just amazing super clean and super clear water.. Stood i was on the island for 7 days and it was a must everyday for me and my family
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,Diving snorkeling beautiful beaches so you can choose water fun or relaxing. So its the best of both worlds. The location is wonderful with great dining and shopping all along 7 mile.
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,Water was beautiful. We rented a couple of chairs and an umbrella. Not too crowded. The kids rode the banana boat and had a great time.
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,Beautiful beach and views! We rented snorkel equipment and had a blast. We saw so many beautiful fish and sea creatures. It's some of the best snorkeling we have done. Just be mindful of the current it's pretty strong.
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,You will not find a more beautiful stretch of perfect white sand and crystal clear blue water. It is Caribbean calm and a super gentle slope so very kid friendly. You can snorkel out past the seagrass to find some corals. Our first day a sea turtle swam next to my son and I for 30 minutes checking us out.
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,This was a pretty great beach visit! We chanced it and took public transit to and from. We almost missed our tender back to the ship but it was a pretty amazing time all round !! Gorgeous sand great snorkeling spot!
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,Only reason I gave it a 4 star is that it is very salty and when you first get in it irrated my kids eyes. But we went in July and it was like bath water could see the bottom stunning.
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,I have visited beaches in St Thomas St Martin Jaimaica and many others. Seven Mile Beach is the best I've visited! Clean sand beautiful blue water tropical fish! Loved it!
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,

g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,Water is the Bluest ever seen. So clean and no one asks for money or begs!! Public beaches are beautiful.
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,This beach is beautiful water is clear and the waves were calm. The entry had minimal rocks. It can get crowded though. The beach area in front of the Marriott is great for snorkeling. I went to the beaches on the north end and the waves were strong and the entrance was rocky.
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,7 miles of white sand and clear green ocean. Doesn't get better than that. Friendly people and tons of activities to fill your days
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,We went to the Seven Mile Beach Beautiful nice soft sand Warm water one free Drink when you arrive. Love it!
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,Blue ocean and white sand. It's great and easy to get to by bus. Plenty of places to eat nearby and volleyball and soccer nets to use.
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,Beautiful beach. It gets pretty crowded. The governors mansion is also along the beach and you walk right past it. Water is the most beautiful color.
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,Pristine clean soft sand no big waves adult chest high for quite a distance from shore. Some dive companies will meet you offshore at your hotel or condo depending on time of year
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,The beach is clean and the ocean is just beautiful. This is our 2nd trip and it was just as wonderful as the first time we went
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,Great beach with warm blue water. Marriott resort has a bar on the beach that's available to beach goers. One of the best beaches we've ever been too.
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,This was my 2nd trip to Grand Cayman and Seven Mile beach is one of the reasons I come back. White sand that is clean very fine and expansive. Waters are clean warm and sparkling. No question - this beach is busy but I never found it difficult to find a quiet corner.
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,We enjoyed our stay on 7 mile beach. Every evening we watch the sunset. Some areas can be crowded especially the days when the cruise ships are in but totally worth the visit.
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,We stayed at comfort Suites and it was just a little walk to the most beautiful beach I have ever seen! We didn't want to leave!
g147367,d2385044,February 21 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 20 2016,Fantastic beaches great boat rides and snorkeling. Stingray city a must see. Sandy beaches and great hotels
g147367,d2385044,February 20 2016,Spent a few hours here during our cruise excursion. Beautiful sand beach and crystal clear water. The coral reef comes very close to shore at parts so had to walk down the beach to find good entry point with sand bottom. Water was warm and welcoming.
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,The water is perfectly clear and so warm. There are many hotels but there is public access so you need not stay at a beachfront resort to be able to use one of the worlds most beautiful beaches. Plenty to do or not if that is what you prefer.
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,Was off of the cruise ship. Wish I could have stayed longer. Best beach I have ever visited. Great food. They even accept USD cash. Great music and not too loud.
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,I love Seven Mile Beach...that is what keeps bringing us back to the Island. The soft white sand the clear waters of the Caribbean all add up to a beautiful location!
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,OK not Jones Beach or Jersey Shore crowded but bust for the Islands. Come at sundown; cooler then too.
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,Gorgeous beach. Soft sand clear and clean water. Lots of properties on the beach to choose from. We stayed at the marriott and loved every minute of it
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,Beautiful Beach. The water is crystal clear you can even see fish swim around your feet. The sand is wonderful and soft and my feet were baby soft after walking around in it for a week. Not crowded. Could see the cruise ships come in to port.
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,Seven mile beach is clean the water is pretty and warm. The sand is clean no trash on the beach but it was nothing to rave about. It is the cleanest beach of all the beaches on 7 mile. Free of rocks and dibris. All in all enjoyable for families with children.
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,Simply beautiful! The snorkeling is great! It is just a wonderful nice place to relax and soak up the sun. Bonus: no chickens on the beach.
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,The sand is just amazing. The waterbis so clear and there is alwsys a nice breeze. We keep coming because it's so much fun. The snorkeling could be better if they put a few artificial reefs out there. There are other good spots on the island for snorkeling.
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,The beach is gorgeous but you can expect LOTS of people and drinking etc. not a quiet relaxing beach
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,Beautiful powdery sand gorgeous water and an easy swim to Governor's Reef where fish are plentiful. Quiet and clean.
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,Beautiful clear water. Warm and clam. Snorkeling was close by at Governor's Reef. Easily walkable and not much rocks but the water is full of coral. Not as quite picturesque as Grace Bay in Turks and not as large as Eagle Beach in Aruba but what you's expect for a Caribbean vacation.
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,The beach is so clean! The water is so clear and calm. The sand is so soft. So relaxing. So many activities to do.
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,this beach is truly wonderful it really is the paradise beach you see in the movies. the bars along it are friendly and warm and have shade if you want to get out of the sun. it is brilliant for walking along safe and clean.
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,Seven Mile beach is massive with white powdery sand clear aqua blue ocean. Seven Mile Beach is very special.
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,We were on several stretches of Seven Mile Beach and found them all to be enjoyable. Some resorts will ask you to move if you are not staying at their property but there is still plenty of public beach area.
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,We stopped here as part of a day tour and I want to come back to Cayman just to stay on this part of the island!! That beach is just gorgeous. Beautiful clean white sand beaches and amazingly clear waters. Wish we could have spent more time there!
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,Clear blue water with excellent visibility and big wide beach with beautiful white sand. There were no seashells this time of year if you are into sea shells but everything else was perfect.
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,This is one of the most beautiful beaches I've ever been to. The water was calm and crystal clear we rented jet skis and rode on the banana boat. There was a mobile truck food vendor selling everything including ice cream. A cab from the Carnival Pier only cost $5 pp and access to the beach was included
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,Was a fun time at the beach. Nice cool clean water. Went to the free part had a pavilion to be under to leave our stuff. Felt very safe. Was a shower and changing room very close by.
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,Long beach with lots of condos and hotels. There are a few beach clubs but they get really crowded. If you access the beach just south or north of the beach clubs then you get whole beach to yourselves. There is a little snorkeling you can do along the short so make sure to bring your snorkel.
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,The beach is gorgeous and all public. Extremely clean clear blue water. We went in the summer and it was quiet.
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,The water is so warm and calm. I love the beach and enjoyed walking along seven mile beach. The beach can get crowded so we always went around 3:00pm and spent the morning hours at the pool while everyone else was at the beach. It's the best spot to hang out and relax. Great sports being played and music.
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,Stayed at a hotel right on seven mile beach  amazing sand and water  one of the best snorkeling I have ever done lots of life not very far from shore  if you like beach and water cant miss this.
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,I have been to this beach 3 to 4 times and it's amazing every time. It's my favorite beach in the world. The sand and perfect and like powder. The water is the clearest bluest most perfect water in the Caribbean! You absolutely must make this beach a part of your trip to Grand Cayman.
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,We just spent 5 days at the Marriott in seven mile beach. Beautiful blue water just be prepared to see lots of people if you chose to stay on it. I still was able to enjoy it but not the place I'd go for a relaxing vacation
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,Beautiful sand beaches with clear water but packed with lots of people. The properties were packed and most chairs were taken.
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,Beautiful beach! The sand is so clean and white and the water is perfectly clear! Been many times and it is always wonderful!
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,Enjoyed the day on the beach. Beautiful water. Arguing over the price for a chair and umbrella was definitely a bummer.
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,Sun  sand and best waters in the area. You can rent chairs at some of the public areas. Not a lot of people and we were there mid week.
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,Beautiful white sandy beaches. Clean. Perfect. Safe. Well lit at night. Always enjoy Seven Mile Beach.
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,Our absolute #1 vacation destination. Pristine beaches crystal clear water. Fantastic restaurants. It's the whole package.
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,I have stayed at various properties on 7 mile beach . Long and rambling beach . Great for walks. Quintessential Caribbean blue water . Soft gentle sand under the feet. Wonderful sealife right at waist deep water and beyond . I remain torn between grace bay Turks and 7 mile beach . Both exquisite
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,7 Mile Beach is simply gorgeous. The sand is smooth and white and the water is as clear as a swimming pool. The blue colors the phenomenal sunsets and the easy to get to restaurants and bars make 7 Mile our favorite!
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,We stayed at a resort on Seven Mile Beach and it was Beautiful! We walked up and down the beach and loved the views the sand and the beautiful water! The water temperature was perfect! So relaxing to lay by the beach and listen to the waves roll in.
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,Seven Mile is beautiful! It can be a bit crazy with the cruise ships in port but you can find a secluded spot fairly easily. If you want chairs you will pay $10.00 for two and an umbrella is an additional $5.00.
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,Beautiful white sand and turquoise water characterize the section of Seven Mile Beach in front of the Marriott. The reef is near the shore so snokeling is easy.
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,With the exception of the areas in front of the hotels the beach is wide open with room to spread out. Swim from anywhere on shore out about 150 feet and there will most likely be reef and fish to see.
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,One of the world's best beaches. Gets very crowded when cruis ships are in port. Plan travel on days when no ships are in port.
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,Beautiful beach one of the cleanest and most beautiful I've ever seen. Crystal clear waters undersea wildlife abound and beautiful white sand.
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,What a fantastic Beach. There is lots to do on the beach but you just sit and relax and people watch is the best.
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,White sand beaches the way you think the Caribbean should look like! The water is warm and shallow enough to enjoy. Really a special place!
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,Love this island! This was one of the best trips we have ever taken! Everyone was very friendly and knew us by name. The employees at the hotel were great and the beach was beautiful! It was very clean and not very crowded. They had everything we could possibly want to do and were very helpful!
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,Perfectly smooth and white sand mixed with crystal clear water and amazing reefs to snorkel and explore.
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,The beaches in Grand Cayman are just beautiful...every one of them. The water is so blue and this beach goes on forever. This whole island is amazing. A little pricey but so beautiful. I'd move there in a minute if I could. Such a well kept island. No signs of poverty anywhere. The people are so friendly. Love it!
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,Loved Seven Mile Beach! The water was so blue and clear. I've never seen anything like it before. We will definitely be returning.
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,white sands beautiful calm blue sea and can walk all the way along it. Beautiful. If you go to Cayman you have to go to the beach!!
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,Beautiful beach! The biggest highlight for me was the clear blue water and the amazing snorkeling and just walking along the beach for miles (it's not a very wide beach but it certainly goes on for miles)
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,The only area of 7 mile beach that we were at was Governor's Beach. It was beautiful clear blue water. There was great snorkeling if you swam out towards the buoys. We rented paddleboards from the Red Sail company located at the Westin Hotel. The teenage girls played pick up games of volleyball. Wonderful!!!
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,What a beautiful beach. We have been to many islands in the Caribbean and this is one of the most beautiful. You can walk for hours. The sand is so soft and the water crystal clear. Saw lots of fish and even sting rays while swimming (they didnt bother you).
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,Seven Mile Beach covers obviously a lot of territory. At the northern end make sure to check out the Turtle farm. The best place to stay easily is the Marriott.
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,We loved our 2 week vacation in Grand Cayman. We visited 7 mile beach often because the beach was beautiful and there were a few great reefs off the beach if you don't mind swimming a few hundred yards. Enjoy!
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,The beach is beautiful and the snorkeling is fantastic. Lots of restaurants and bars to fuel your day. Traffic is very hectic so stay at a nice resort and let the concierge help schedule any offsite activities you want to do. AVOID the city of Georgetown like the plague: it is a cruise ship infested tourist trap!
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,If you want a lovely beach with icing sugar sand and azure sea look no further than here the only downside is the volume of people
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,Even when the beach is packed it doesn't feel packed. The water is crystal clear and you always have a great view for people watching.
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,Cannot say enough about Seven Mile Beach! Absolutely gorgeous. Every time I looked at the water it was like seeing it for the first time. We've been home for two days and I wish that we were back there again.
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,clear waters wonderful entry-level snorkeling opportunities some shells (you really have to look) and gentle waves wonderful place to watch sunsets
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,If you want waves this is not your beach otherwise it is beautiful. Also some nice reef not far off shore so some really nice snorkeling. Very clean and great to walk on.
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,West facing so there are sunsets to die for. What is there not to like swimming walking and opportunities for numerous activities. Difficult to leave!
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,The most beautiful beach in the Caribbean. There is a coral reef off the Governor's summer house. You'll recognize it by the long white picket fence. Perf ft snorkeling for the whole family.
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,Nice wide beach (in most sections) warm water snorkeling off of some parts of the beach. The beaches can be crowded in front of the major hotels.
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,Very clean and beautiful beach area. Short walk from the hotel and great location. Water and sand were perfect.
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,Beautiful beach! Water was crystal clear. Quiet beach white sand. On a scale of 1 to 10 this was at least a 12!
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,so beautiful. powdery white sand stunning blue water. not crowded and no beach vendors. lots of good snorkeling places.
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,Fabulous beach. Have stayed at the Marriott and the beach there is awesome. There is nothing that is not awesome about Seven Mile Beach.
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,Super Clear water calm and plenty of fish to look at. Also a man made reef for snorkeling..Awesome
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,Soft white sand lapping water...best place to relax. While the beach is not technically 7 miles it is long enough that you can enjoy a peaceful walk along the sand and if it gets too hot you can dip into the amazing blue water.
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,the beach is beautiful if you like to be on the beach this is the one I have enjoyed in many years. The water the beach the people the sites are outstanding.
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,Water is all colors of blue and sand is white and fine just like you'd imagine a Caribbean beach. With as many hotels on the beach I would think it would be more crowded but it is not. Water was warm and you could snorkel right off the beach.
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,Soft sand turquoise waters and endless sunshine... need I say more?! Wonderufl beach to just relax and chill out on... but if you fancy a bit more adventure there are plenty of activities to choose from. And if you want some peace a lot of quite spots you can laze on.
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,This has to be the most beautiful beach that I have seen. The water is so very calm and the setting soooo relaxing. It's a great time.
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,A stay on 7 mile beach is the best of all! Great accommodations walkable dining a retail options and calm sea to swim in before work and after! Don't forget your goggles!
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,Unfortunately 7 mile beach was replaced by mega high rises and condos. This should be renamed 7 mile condo. There is a resemblance to downtown Houston or LA and void of the personality that 7 mile had years ago.
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,Better than Bavaro in Punta Cana. Better than Playa Mujeres in Mexico. Decent sized waves on Seven Mile Beach. Powder sand. Very enjoyable beach experience.
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,WOW what a great beach hot sunny and tons of beautiful blue/white water.. Clear sand and great for walking early in the mornings.
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,Clear blue water white sand light breeze great for long walks been to MANY beaches and this is in my top five. Grew up on the Florida panhandle and this one competes with the sugar white sands there.
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,Best beach in the Caribbean... not too crowded great beach service provided by the hotel. Beach towels sun loungers and beach toys all included.
g147367,d2385044,February 19 2016,This beach is the most beautiful beach I have ever seen. We stayed about mid way of the stretch of beach. The sand was soft and white. The water crystal clear with a beautiful blue color
g147367,d2385044,February 18 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 18 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 18 2016,One of the nicest beaches in the Caribbean! Beautiful white sand and turquoise water. Lots of snorkeling and water sports opportunities.
g147367,d2385044,February 18 2016,This visit was one of my 3rd visits and it is always fun  great miles of beach and soft sand and perfect ocean
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,Wife and I took a taxi van from the port (carnival cruise) to get to the beach. It took us 15mim aprox. The beach was extremely crowded. There was no spot to chill out. Not the best beach for a nice walk o for a nice scenery.
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,Beautiful sandy beach - and a wonderful place to stroll and relax. All the stories you hear about this beautiful place are true!
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,This is one of the most beautiful beaches. The water is so clear and green. It is a great place to go for Spring Break
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,Loved this beach I snorkeled everyday. The water is very clear and very peaceful. Driving can be a bit difficult we took the bus and taxi's.
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,Not a very wide beach but beautiful none the less. Amazing white sand and tranquil blue waters and tons of water sports to enjoy
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,We stayed in a condo on the North end of Seven Mile Beach. It was perfect - the water is amazing and the sand is great. What a relaxing vacation.
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,Long soft & smooth sandy beach - perfect for walking along. Grab a mask & fins and you can easily snorkel right off the beach.
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,Like the sand and the hotels along the beach. Like that you can snorkel with some fish right in the "swimming-designated" water. Didn't like the $75 bill for four drinks one appetizer and one salad at Marriott on beach but wow their service all around that hotel is beyond outstanding.
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,Loves this beach. Walked for miles on it. You can see the fish in the water with out snorkeling! Bring some bread!
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,Soft cream sand and blue  blue water. Serene and family orientated when you want. Plenty of water sports everywhere.
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,Stayed at Ritz Carlton. Other hotels and rentals dot this long stretch of a clean beach areas for swimming snorkeling kayaks and relaxation. Swimming areas are clear and you can see the bottom easily. Snorkel further out and bring your GO PRO camera!
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,The Marriott Grand Cayman Beach Resort is within walking distance to so many restaurants entertainment and shopping. Public transportation is always readily available as well.
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,Snorkeling and swimming. Nice calm water. Love it. Easy access from wherever you happen to be. Sometimes the beach and sand is narrow but great sunsets and blue water.
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,The water is so clear and beautiful. The sand feels amazing like walking on clouds. It's one of the best places I been to. I would love to return.
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,This is one of the best beaches we have been to. Love the white sand and great food in the area. One of our best places to go to.
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,Beautiful beach with nice white sand. Great for morning walk/run. Great color to the water. Man made reef off Marriott for snorkeling with lots of fish. A bit crowded and if you want a front row lounge chair get up early.
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,The 7 mile Island was beautiful from morning to night. The people were really nice everywhere we went. And the fresh fish..... should I say more?
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,We stayed across the street from this beach and we probably spent the least amount of time here. It was nice though. It wasn't crowded and has white sand as far as you can see. Breathtaking view. You can walk up down the beach and there are tons of bars/restaurants.
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,What can be better than Seven Mile Beach? It's amazing it's beautiful it's pretty much the perfect place. Pack your bags book a flight and enjoy!
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,Beautiful sand little surf few people fun snorkeling spectacular sunsets - paradise! Great for walking and people watching
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,Pina Colada's from Bar Jack are delicious! The waiters on the beach are so kind. Chairs and cushions are so comfortable! I wish the beds weren't so expensive to reserve.
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,The sunset was amazing and you were able to walk to several restaurants and bars. It was great.there was absolutely nothing not to like. The weather is perfect and the sand is sparkling white
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,Beautiful water soft sand.......just perfect! We stayed at Meridien and the beach is deeper than in some of the areas on 7 mile beach. Wasn't anything to complain about! We will be back
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,Staff was accommodating and attentive. Beach and pool was peaceful and never over crowded. Food menu is a little pricey but it's vacation. The menu need an addition like salmon and broccoli. More vegetables would be a great addition to the menu.
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,Nice beach with beautiful sand and water. I'm don't think the beach is seven miles long but it's still a good place to go relax. It can get crowded if a lot of cruise ships are in port so go early!
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,Seven Mile Beach has tranquil beautiful water even non-swimmers will have a good time in the clear water.
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,Everything costs...Beach chairs umbrellas...food is outrageous. My suggestion is book an excursion. You'll save money in the long run. Seven mile beach is just like any other beach.
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,Nice beach. Reasonably price shuttle with full access to the beach without paying resort pricing. Local offer foot and body massages on the beach for as little as $5. The food was exceptional at the local eatries.
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,The clean clear blue water and the clean sand with miles to walk and enjoy the scenery. Lots to see with the cruise ships seen out in the ocean places to rest and eat at with clean washrooms and music to enjoy.
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,Beautiful beach. Beautiful sunsets over the water. Water is usually calm as the beach is on the island's west end and is the leeward side. The water is shallow and warm.
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,We stayed at the Grand Cayman Beach Resort located on Seven Mile Beach. The sand is soft and the water is perfect for swimming.
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,Soft white powder sand and you can sink in to your ankles. Perfect for an evening stroll at sunset. Or take your frothy to a beach chair and dream the evening away
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,Beautiful beach clean lots of birds and plenty of space for lots of people to enjoy. Loved the Ritz and its awesome staff.
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,Awesome time stayed at the Westin Saw lots of fish and some sting rays people were very accomodating
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,We have traveled all over the Carribbean- but it is hard to beat Seven Mile Beach- white sand- bluish green clear water- just awesome. So many great restaurants and attractions. And so easy to fly to from USA.
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,its as beautiful as they say it is and there is snorkeling all along the beach. must visit! there are several public access points along this beach with ample parking.
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,what a beautiful place to visit. something for everyone shopping sun dining relaxing diving. you name it they have what you are looking for. a great family experience. everyone is friendly and willing to help make your day better. I never felt safer in another country. we will be returning again! thank you
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,Although I may be biased I have been to many beaches in many other places and our very own Seven Mile Beach is the best beach I have ever seen. Nothing I have seen compares to the fine white sand and the clearest calmest blue water.
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,One of the best beaches I have ever been to..........will definitely go again if not yearly! Clean soft sand and crystal clear turquoise waters.
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,One of the best beaches I've ever been to. The water is calm and nice. The seaweed is at its absolute minimum. It isn't packed with people and the night walks are enjoyable with a nice sea breeze. Powdery sands make for a perfect medium. Just great!
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,We stayed at the Grand Cayman Beach Suites right on Seven Mile Beach. The beach is beautiful---clean and the water pristine. In the morning and at sunset we'd walk along the water. We couldn't stop looking out into the ocean. It was really beautiful.
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,There are better placed on the island to go. Unless you really enjoy beaches choked with people and jet skis it's best to avoid.
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,Sevien mile beach is a awesome location the Crystal Clear water and warmth of the beach and water is fantastic. Very clean and I hope it stays that way. Too often I have found that people destroy a beach by leaving their garbage on the beach after enjoying it for the day.
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,We got there after the stringray city tour and there were not do many people at the beach. Water is so calm and the place is unbelievable beautiful.
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,We have been to SO many beaches and none have enchanted us more than 7 mile. Just amazing. The sand is sugar white and the water the most beautiful aqua you have ever seen. Perfect for a morning beach walk. And amazing sunsets.
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,This is by far one of the most gorgeous beaches in the world. It is pristine white with turquoise water and the sand is as soft as icing sugar. The water is inviting and warm and the beach stretches for as far as your eye can see. Stunning.
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,Beautiful beach with beautiful clear waters. You have to pay a little bit more for the brolly and beds but you're on holiday. No time to be mean. Just enjoy the setting.
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,Seven mile beach is beautiful. It is protected by a reef and the water is crystal clear. There are many water sports available paddle boarding kayaking jet skis and more. You will run out of time before you run out of things to do.
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,Could be one of the prettiest beaches in the world. White sandy beaches with clear blue water. Snorkeling was fun and water was the perfect temperature!
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,Quite rocky and the entrance to the sea is it not nice as it seems. Big rocks in the middle of the sand. From far it looks beautiful but closer you get it is not clean or nice as expected. Also very exensive to have food or drink on the beach.
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,The beach and sand area has been expanded. The hotel lobby and the rooms have had a fabulous makeover.
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,Number one beach in the world by my book. Sand is whiter than sand from Flamenco Beach Culebra Puerto Rico. Both are beautiful but there are no waves at Seven Mile Beach. You can see fish a few yards from shore while snorkeling. We can't wait to return!!!!!
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,This really is an excellent beach for just about anything: watching a sunset relaxing snorkeling scuba etc. Highly recommended
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,Beautiful white sand and crystal clear water not over crowded. You can see the fish swimming near you.
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,One of the best beaches I've ever gone to? Great water and the sand is groomed daily. I liked the cabana boys but disliked the prices of drinks.
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,It is a very nice beach with clear blue water. You could see the fish swimming by. Nice to take a long stroll along the beach and sip a cocktail at sunset. The sunsets were beautiful!
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,We took a cab from the cruise port to Calico Jack's just to get some time on the beach. The beach was absolutely gorgeous not very crowded and very clean. If I were to travel and stay in Grand Cayman I would try to stay on Seven Mile Beach.
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,Since we stayed across the street from 7 Mile beach we were restricted with how we could use the beach. Once you get by about three feet of shell and stone  the water and sand are very good. Beach areas in general are very tight.
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,Seven Miles has everything that is needed to have great time while vacationing at the Caymans! Pristine sand beaches awesome water-sports from long-board to snorkeling. Recommended!
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,Seven Mile has white sandy beaches and crystal clear water. Very clean and well taken care of. The beach in front of the Westin is by far the best. Very wide and lots of things to do.

g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,We stayed at the Westin right on seven mile beach. It is a beautiful white sandy beach with clear blue green water and even some wildlife swimming around your feet. We were in the water everyday. How can you miss it.
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,We took a local tour bus to get us from our Cruise Ship to this beautiful beach. The sand the sun and the beautiful water! Make sure you get off the ship and take a dip in the clear water. And if the sun gets too much you should try a local brew to cool down.
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,Seven Mile Beach literally took my breath away. It is so beautiful that pictures didn't even do it justice. 100% must take a walk down the whole thing at some point! If you get lucky a cruise ship won't have docked and you'll have the beach to yourself like we did.
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,Miles of peaceful beach! Loved it. Great place to walk in the morning. Many hotels and places to stay right on the beach. Wish we could have spent more time there. Can't wait to go back.
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,I have been to beaches all over the world and Seven Mile Beach is right up there. Great sand beautiful water what more can you ask for? Snorkeling is OK in front of the Marriott. Otherwise you may have to travel over by Stingray City.
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,7 Mile beach is 7 miles of glory. With the choice of shorelines so varied all over the world. 7 Mile beach is claarly a great choice. The Cayman island is a wonderful place to bring your family and loved ones. Maybe not to meet any now people but great to vacation with those you care for
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,For the beginner snorkeler this is the way to go. You can walk off the beach and into the water and find a reef instantly! It wont take you long to be swimming alongside some sea life but be on the lookout for barracudas!
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,This beach was amazing! We rented wave runners and played in the Caribbean Sea what a day! The white sands and crystal clear water were awesome. We are definitely making an effort to come back!
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,Clean beach...we went in the evenings so we never had an issue securing a beach chair. The sunsets were beautiful. Walk with a lot of sunscreen because I got sunburned
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,It lives up the the hype gorgeous in every direction you look! You can walk the whole beach and see all the different hotels.
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,It's a beach but with crystal clear water great for snorkeling and clean sand! Head to the top end of it to a part called cemetery beach it has the nicest snorkeling spots.
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,The 7 miles beach is one of the best i have been to . I have travelled thru the whole Caribbean and know most of the 27 islands and this one of the most beautiful beaches i have seen
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,there is nothing to not like here... white sand beach... gentle waves... great for a beach walk... you can stop along the way and pick up a drink and some food... i think all the hotel on seven mile beach offer chairs and shade... diving is awesome
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,Loved being able to walk forever. Gentle waves beautiful colors. Not over-crowded many hotels are laid-back 2-3 story style. Some stretches of beach have tall pines for very laid back feel.
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,We just loved this beautiful beach water was crystal clear and sand powdery white. There is nothing like it and you can walk for miles. Truly my favorite beach .
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,Many beautiful beaches to explore. Lots of activities to enjoy. Stay out of town when cruise ships are in. Condo we rented was not exactly as advertised but on a beautiful stretch of Seven Mile Beach. Overal we had a nice time
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,to me Seven Mile Beach in Cayman was the best section of the beach area to relax - swin and even snorkel
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,Most beautiful water I have ever seen…snorkeling amazing! Calm waters and wide beaches. Great for a run or just relaxing on the sand.
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,Gorgeous beach. Beautiful water white sand great snorkeling. Best beach I have ever visited. Great for long walks.
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,people are very friendly on the beach..felt very safe. water temps were perfect and lots of fish right in front of the hotel.
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,It was a beautiful beach. It was wonderful to just relax in the sun snorkel or walk the beach. We also liked the water with many sandbars...it seemed to go for miles! It was a $4.00 each cab ride from the port to the beach each way and a $2.00 each fee to enter the Beach. Worthwhile afternoon!
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,Colorful and crystal clear water was breathtaking. Beautiful homes & resorts. Nice golf courses. Lovely resorts. There were some great restaurants. Locals very friendly and nice. WE really enjoyed our stay here.
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,If you like the nightlife of shopping in the p.m. stores close here at 7 p.m. This is not the place for you. Bars/restaurants stay open later.
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,If you're coming to Cayman for the beach this is the one you want to be on. While the rest of the island has smaller public beaches this is by far the most impressive and with the most dining and hotel options.
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 17 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 16 2016,Great Beach for walking and people watching. Multiple places to stop for food and drink. Felt safe the entire trip in this lovely island
g147367,d2385044,February 16 2016,Great location so much beach to walk on makes no difference where you stay on 7 mile. The Westlin was our entry to the beach has beach ambassadors to help with loungers and beach towels available.
g147367,d2385044,February 15 2016,Beautiful beach lots of water activities that you can do - even if you are not staying at one of the hotels.
g147367,d2385044,February 14 2016,No activities due to the wind but its a beautiful stretch of beach we saw kite surfing and the waves added to the fun of your usual Caribbean vacation
g147367,d2385044,February 13 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 11 2016,Absolutely beautiful! A true getaway to another world of relaxation! May the beaches stay as clean as they are for many years to come... a Caribbean oasis!
g147367,d2385044,February 11 2016,This beach goes on and on and you could find your own spot and never feel overcrowded! There are some lovely hotels so you don't have to walk far. It's only a short way from George Town so plenty to do!
g147367,d2385044,February 10 2016,first time on the island crystal clear water soft sand beach what was really great was all the hotel staff cling te seaweed off the beach everyday very nice place will return all the locals were very friendly also !
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,This beach was beautiful the water was clear and fairly shallow. There are bathrooms and restaurants and bars close by which made it nice when you have little ones. The only drawback was there was a ton of people but it didn't really seem to get in our way. Loved it.
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,perfect crystal clear water. Coral sand white and thin. Safe and with plenty of places to get a drink. Very very close to perfection.
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,The sand is creamy and the water is crystal clear. Was snorkeling and saw a wild sea turtle just about 300 feet from the shore. On a calm day it is lovely but watch out for the stormy windy days as the current is wicked and the visibility is nil.
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,Second year in a row at Villas of the Galleons on Seven Mile Beach. One diver one golfer in our group. Close to everything - dive shop (Red Sail Sports) golf groceries airport. Saw a juvenile eagle ray snorkeling off the beach last year. No pool at VoG but quiet beach in between the Westin and the Ritz.
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,Loved staying here. Everything you needed was within walking distance or a low bus fare. Great people beautiful sand clear water and amazing views.
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,the seven mile beach was so beautiful. i went to the turtle farm which was an awesome experience. i also would recommend not leaving until you visit the distillery where you can drink all day for the 10 US dollars !! Have a great time.
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,The beach side we went was in an area were is not easy to swim specially if you have little kids. On top of that the area is short and there is a lot beach seats that is not easy to move without disturbing other visitors. There ara lots of rocks on shore so be careful .
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,A long white sandy beach combined with turquoise sea - bliss. Great for walking along and also snorkelling close to the shore. You will be amazed at how close the fish come to you.
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,Its a beach. Can't go wrong. Beautiful blue water that you can see through and clean beach. Lots of water sports. Pretty expensive to pay for jet skis etc.
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,While the snorkeling our last two trips here has seemed to have dropped off in terms of the quantity of fish SMB is still a wonderful place to be and stay. You can walk for a long distance and swim in the beautiful sea. It's clean and safe and has lots of shops restaurants and bars within walking distance.
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,Waves are mild. Sand is very fine. Beach is clean. Water is bath-water warm. The water is turquoise/blue. There are coral close enough to the surf so you don't need to go far to snorkel and enjoy the underwater view. The fish that swim around close to surf are quite big beautiful and not shy.
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,The beach perfect white sand blue turquoise sealoungers galore. Service impeccable people friendly drinks cool and long. Would love to live here but Tipton pulls me back ha ha. Anyone who wants to go to Caribbean then this is a place not to miss. Will definitely do this again.
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,There is no disputing that the water is beautiful and the sand is great along Seven Mile Beach. Highly developed this beach has sections where it's far more crowded than my ideal.
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,We stayed on Seven Mile Beach at Villas of the Galleon and it was beautiful. We really enjoyed our stay. The staff are fantastic very helpful and friendly. The guests are very friendly we met some great people there.
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,beautiful soft sand lovely for long morning walks mosquitos stay off the beach some ok snorkeling around and about...
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,The beaches were amazing! The water was so warm clear and beautiful. Even at night and early morning the water was very comfortable. For more privacy head north past the Governor's residence. Don't swim in front of the Ritz Carlton as there were numerous rocks.
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,If you are a shell seeker you will be disappointed as we saw more rocks than shells but Seven Mike beach is one of the most beautiful beaches in the world. And the water is crystal clear to make snorkeling great
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,Wow!! The beaches were amazing! The water was so warm clear and beautiful. I am not sure but I believe you can rent chairs and/or umbrellas. Obviously if you're in Grand Cayman you are at the beach..
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,This long stretch of white sugary sand is unbelievable. The waters are the most gorgeous shade of blue and warm. Reefs are nearby for those who enjoy snorkelling and compared to other beaches I've seen it was relatively uncrowded. Not to be missed if in Grand Cayman!
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,A spectacular beach with lots of great accommodations. I recommend the condos over hotel rooms. Lots of great choices!
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,Excellent beach with warm clear water soft white sand. Surrounded by top quality hotels and condos. Very classy - no vendors to hassle you. Only complaint too many people allow their dogs to run around and swim unattended.
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,The beach was very clean there are so many types of activities. The water was crystal clear and full of life
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,Soft white sand. Snorkeling fun for kids. Peary walk to shops and restaurants. Can get loud in front of resorts or bars.
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,Walk up and down since the tide changes where the fish are day to day. Buy a snorkel kit in the gift shop
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,nice sandy beach but not alot of shade for those who need it. Calm water and great for walking. The snorkling was good and the beach was very clean. We took a cooler bag along filled with ice & beverages. It is a great place to be for a fantasic sunset.
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,The beach was gorgeous - we walked both directions from our resort on multiple days and really enjoyed the beach. We also snorkeled there but the fish were fairly limited except for certain areas. Highly recommend
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,Took a taxi  $4 each way. Really felt it was a waste of time. The beach was nothing special  beach chairs to rent and an entrance fee  no outside food or drinks not even water. We came and went in about an hour
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,The beach and water are stunning. Great snorkeling. For smaller crowds head away from the cruise ships. Governor's Beach and Cemetary Beach are just gorgeous.
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,We stayed at the Ritz Carlton so that was where we were on seven mile beach----it was like no other beach I have been on! Soft sand everywhere and somehow there were no real waves coming in at all!
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,Enticing calm clear warm turquoise water. Good snorkling. Long stretch of beach wonderful for morning and evening walks. Sand so soft and feels like putty.
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,We traveled to seven mile beach recently and had a great time. We loved the sand and water. There are many places to stop and either drink or have dinner. We took nightly strollsswam and snorkeled daily. It truly was a great experience.
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,Clearest water (no seaweed or anything floating in it; can see your toes) whitest soft sand beach great for walking or running for miles. Every water sport option you might like and the sky/water combination is like a painting.
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,Some of the cleanest clearest calmest water anywhere! Great snorkeling and diving as well. Always a pleasant day there.
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,We stayed on 7 mile beach at the Westin beautiful beach front crystal clear water and great sand. The Staff at the Westin were very accommodating and attentive to us. You can order lunch right on the beach from this location as long as you are staying at the Westin
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,Had a great 5 days on 7 mile beach. Sand is soft and fine. The water is to die for! So many colors of blue! Plenty of activities available if that is what you want. Good off shore snorkeling in places.
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,We went to Tiki Beach for the day during our port of call stop in Grand Cayman. This was our first visit to Tiki Beach. The snorkeling just off shore was very good with a lot of fish to see
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,The prettiest beach I have ever seen. So mych to do and see its hard to soak it all in. Basking in the amazing scene is wonderful. The ocean water is crystal clear blue and the sand is soft & white. Everyone should experience this wander.
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,Miles of white sand soft beach. Clean with lots of hotels and water sports available. Enjoyed the kayaks and stand up paddle boards at the Marriott.
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,Seven miles of pristine paradise! Beautiful clean beaches with very friendly people! Such a great place to vacation!
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,Took a taxi here off the Carnival Magic. We arrived very early and the beach was already filled with umbrellas and chairs. No one was hustling are begging you to buy anything. The water & sand was beautiful.
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,We have travelled and I must say that this is one of our favorites. Unlike Jamica or DR you can walk the beach without being harassed. The sand is like sugar no seaweed or hard shells to step on. The water is crystal clear and is like bath water.
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,Beautiful beach with lots to do once you are there... If you come from the ship make sure you get off early and be one of the 1st to the beach. Best chairs and beach spots are normally gone before 10:00am.
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,Beatiful long golden beach with amazing sea. We went at the weekend and had some trouble parking but there was space out on the road with a short walk to access.
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,Gorgeous beach recommend walking along and enjoying the beauty of the location. White pristine sand and mostly smooth. Some rocky parts when you go into the water but just move a couple of yards and you'll find a perfect area for relaxing.
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,Stayed at the Ritz and had the pleasure to look over this beach for 5 night of course it is West facing so you get the beautiful sunset every evening. You must see this beach and enjoy a cold one while looking over the beauty.
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,The beach in front of the Marriott is nice. Additionally there are reef balls sunk just off shore that provide for nice snorkeling. Long walks up and back on Seven Mile beach make for a great start to your day in paradise.
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,Rough weather on this side when we were there. Not crowded at all. Bottom is sandy mixed with lots of coral and rocks - cannot go barefoot. Was Ok but better beaches abound.
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,Beach was clean water was clear and the temperature was perfect! Snorkeling off the beach was very easy to do and enjoyable.
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,Gorgeous beach white sand turquoise blue water perfect for swimming. This is a perfect beach for a long stroll on the beach. Many of the places on it are condos but you can walk through the Ritz Hotel & check it out. We didn't stay there but it's a great-looking hotel. (We did use the facilities ~ very nice restrooms!)
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,Although crowded the water was beautiful. People can paddle board and rent jet skis as well as snorkel.
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,It's actually 5 miles long but a wonderful walk. There are private areas that are marked along the way and the best snorkel places are scattered along the beach. You may want to take you a lunch and drinks. there are no real places to grab food along the beach
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,Great beach with super warm and clear water. Great place to snorkel as well. There is a charge for the chairs but there are also showers and restrooms as well worth the price plus a nice little bar to have a cocktail or two!
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,Water blue sea white sands plenty of water sports good beach bars also boat trips Plenty good restaurants near by AgauMizuKraft Peppers all worth a visit and for a good curry southern spice is a must.Caymana bay in walking distance with shops and water front dining lots of good fish dishes
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,Beautiful views relaxing soft powder sand and clear water. Great for morning walks and relaxing on beach. Lots of shady spots too. Water sports and good places for kids.
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,The sand is kept very clean. Water is clean and refreshing when looking to cool off. Kids playing and making sand castles. Plenty of places for casual beachfront dinning.
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,one of the best as you can walk right into the water no seaweedm surf etc. white sand. choose where you stay carefully as it is full of large hotels and condos that can ruin the experience.
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,One of the nicest beaches I have ever seen in my life which includes Paradise Island Hawaii Cancun highly recommend going there nothing but clear white sand for 7 miles and clear water....
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,Read the title. It's a wonderful and amazing gem of Grand Cayman. The sand is powdery and white and the waters flow with gentle waves on the rocky beach. Easy to float and lots of fish and coral!
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,Warm water no waves absolutely amazingly clear. Lots of fish to see and the Pelicans flying around. Great fun indeed!
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,Seven Mile Beach is our favorite place to visit. Whenever we think of going somewhere else we always come back to our favorite place to visit on vacation!! Many great family and friend memories!!
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,One of the best beaches in the world. The fine white sand literally goes on for miles and miles. There is always lots of parking at the various public lots as well if you aren't staying right on the beach.
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,This gorgeous beach is one of the best in the Caribbean the beautiful white sand and warm blue waters of this beach are a must visit when in Grand Caymen.
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,Perfect white sand that stretches for miles. A quiet beach that does not have the local hocking you to buy services or good like many other Caribbean islands. A terrific island a gorgeous beach and a fantastic destination for couples or families.
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,This beach is mediocre. There is nothing ohh-ahhh about it. It just has tons of hotels on it so this beach is emphasized for that reason. At the south (I believe) end of seven mile where all the tourist shops and cruise ships board there is a neat snorkeling area with awesome reefs and caves for advanced divers.
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,I loved the beaches but over spring break the crowds were crazy. It wasn't what I had expected. More like Miami. One hotel after the other but we did find a public beach. Easy to access beach and had parking as well. Toilet facility not the Ritz but ok.
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,Seven Mile Beach is a TRUE GEM. Not only is it STUNNING but there are several spots where you can swim form shore to some of the best snorkeling around.
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,This beach is the best it all of the places in the Caribbean. The water the sand the sunsets are amazing. We are defiantly going to retire on this beach. I love this place. Easy to walk and you wont get hassled by locals selling you stuff or trying to braid your hair. This beach is safe.
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,Walk the beach and watch the sun set every single night. Look for the green flash which I haven't seen yet (it's rare). The beach sand is very soft in most places and the waves are mild. The water is crystal clear. What a great place to relax.
g147367,d2385044,February 9 2016,What's not to love........fine white sand...cool calm aqua water and the best weather . Safe with just the right amount of people yet a completely exclusive feel.
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,I simply loved it here....the water is crystal clear with small fish swimming between your legs white sand and so peaceful. Everything you would need for rest and relaxation to recharge the batteries. Great sun loungers beautiful weather jet skis paddle boards or just run up and down the long stretch of sand.
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,The sand is so soft wear sunscreen 50 or higher. We wore SPF 30 and still got burnt. The water was so clear. The memories we made were amazing.
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,Sand was white. Water was blue. It was paradise! Chairs had to be rented but we brought a towel from the ship and used it. Very nice time.
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,Beautiful long beach. Great for a long beach walk. Very peaceful and pleasant. Great combination of nature and things do and places to eat and drink.
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,Actually 5.5 miles but so long doesn't get at all crowded. Best bit is around the middle either side of Ritz Carlton. Sea really warm but can slope away quickly - quite safe though. Lots of watersports to hire and boat trips available
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,It just doesn't get any better than this! We were on a free public section where there were just enough vendors to get everything we wanted but were left alone when we wanted to be. It has the softest white sand ever and clearest water. I hated when we had to leave.
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,Little outside of George Town's City Centre so take a taxi or if you have a car there is a large parking space. Seven Mile Beach is public beach with lots of things to do and see. From restaurants to water sports and of course enjoying that beautiful Caribbean Sea. Don't miss this one!
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,GORGEOUS GORGEOUS BEACH!!!!!!!! enjoyed jogging on it & relaxing with my feet in the sand. The water is unbelievably turquoise.
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,Prior reviews summed it up pretty well. It is very clean and pretty. There are many tourists but I didn't find it overcrowded. It is definitely worth the stop.
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,a great way to spend the afternoon! We went and walked the beach and then relaxed by the lounge chairs!!! You can never get enough of the picture perfect background!
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,If you visit grand cayman make time for a visit to seven mile beach soft white sand turquoise blue sea just wonderful watersports are expensive but no more than you might expect for the surroundings
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,Great swimming at Sea Grape Beach along with the Beach Bar "Calico Jacks"-great Pina coladas! Also enjoyed cemetery beach for the snorkeling and our favorite was West Bay Beach by Alfresco restaurant--quite snorkeling swimming white sands sea glass
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,Beautiful beach easy swimming. Only negative is it's pretty crowded with lots of hotels and condos. Well that's what you get on a beautiful safe can-drink-the-water Caribbean island.
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,Everything you could want to do on Seven Mile Beach - lots of places to stay eat and lots of beach to explore and enjoy.
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,If you want to get away from it all and chillax on the perfect beach - go to Seven Mile Beach. After a long winter this is just what we needed. Perfect!
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,Fabulous white sandy beach! Calm clear waters and soft white sand as far as the eye can see. Simply beautiful!
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,puts other Carribean beaches to shame! I would come back here in an instant! You can just walk out and snorkel in front of the Marriott
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,Really great water great snorkeling - travelers need to get control go their kids- but hey - that is not the beaches fault- right.
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,Seven Mile Beach deserves the raves it receives. The water is clear warm and filled with beautiful marine life. The beach can get busy by Royal Palms where many visitors from the cruise ships enjoy the beach. But for the most part you can stroll for miles and dream.
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,Beautiful Crystal clear aqua water. .no waves. .we've been to alot of islands and we have to say this is the clearest water.. this is truly the best island for snorkeling and diving.
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,Crystal clear blue water and soft sand. Great to walk on the 7 mile surface. Warm water close to air temp..85 degrees. Highly recommended!
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,We stayed at the Westin which was located directly on the beach. It was very convenient. The water is clear and calm. Sand is very clean. Minimal debris. Great opportunity to see the ocean bottom and take young ones out further in the water with floatation devices. Cool breeze under an umbrella. Apply sunscreen often.
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,Best accommodation to walk from your room barefooted into the white sand and slip into the clear blue of the 'Mar Caribee'!
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,7 Mile Beach is a nice way to spend the day if you are in port during a cruise. TAke a short taxi ride and you are on your way to a great beach day. We rented lounge chairs from the locals for $10.00 a piece. Calico Jacks is a great place for burgers and beer.
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,What a gorgeous place. With so much beauty and character a post card could not do this beach justice. Clear blue water powder white soft sand stunning coral great ambiance. What more could you ask for?
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,White sands clear water not too deep. Warmer at sunset than at noon. Go Parasailing over 7 Mile Beach....gorgeous!
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,the fish life off Cemetery beach is the best on island that I have seen. You can swim to see the Kittiwake (Sunken boat) from there if you like.
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,We were always in sand as far as I can say there was no coral here just lots of sand and people. We had to walk a good distance to get where we could find an empty spot to sit. The business we went through to get to the beach was busy but had good restrooms and changing rooms...
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,Glorious Beach postcard perfect sand and water. Water actives were great and plentiful. Marriott had a lot of free water activities
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,We've been going to seven mile beach for over 20 years and snorkle and dive regularly it's the best. Clear water sandy beachs and sea glass to pic up it's a blast
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,Stunning beach great views with crystal clear waters. Lots of nice beach bars located on the beach that do sun beds for the day. My favourite was Royal Palms. This is the closest it gets to paradise probably my favourite place in the world to chillax!
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,Loved my early morning walks with the rest of the early morning risers. the water temp was about 80 degrees so quite comfortable and the visibility was just wonderful
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,It was a real treat to leave the kids sleeping in the room(11 and 19) and walk the beach each morning with my husband.
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,If you are in the Cayman Islands yout must make a stop on 7 mile beach. The place was absolutely amazing. The water was warm and crystal cleAr. I can not recommend It enough!
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,clear water fine white sand little or no breakers great to walk and snorkel direct from the beach. Not real crowded except at the 2 or 3 major hotels
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,Loved the man-made reefs that make snorkeling so easy. The fish are beautiful and even my 5-year old could easily access the reefs.
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,Seven Mile Beach is a great location on the island with hotels condos and restaurants of many choices but their are many other restaurants around the whole island well worth the short drive.
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,The clearest water I have ever seen. The beach is crowded by the resorts/hotels. You can snorkel and see fish with little effort.
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,This is by far one of the best beaches I have ever been to. My mom and I took a taxi from the cruise port and we were there in a few minutes. The water is unbelievably clear and the beach itself was perfect. The local Cayman beers were great & the views were amazing.
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,Absolutely gorgeous! This is a must see on the bucket list! The water is crystal clear the sand is like powdered sugar.
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,It has soft white sand and crystal clear water! It's great to walk the beach sunbathe swim or do watersports!
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,We were among the throngs of cruisers coming off of 4 or 5 cruise ships. There was approximately 14 quadrillion people on the beach. Beer was reasonably priced. The chairs and umbrellas were coming at a premium. It was an okay time but would not be a reason for a special trip for us.
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,Beautiful Beach so clean and beautiful. Relaxing environment great for swimming with a young family. Snorkeling is a must. The beach is amazing.
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,Beautiful sand. The best. The tourist areas are sometimes crowded but there are always places away from the popular sites.
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,The beach is nice and the ocean there is very calm since it faces west and is relatively protected. Only complaint is that the hotels and condo block the wind (usually from the east) and it can get pretty warm in the afternoon. Almost never has waves higher than a few inches.
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,Great beach to walk tons of resorts and tiki bars along the way. Beautiful beach and crystal clear waters.
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,This is a beautiful beach...sugar white sand and turquoise blue water. Very calm water with views of the cruise ships moving in and out of Georgetown. Stunning!
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,I have never felt sand so fine it is beautiful! The sand feels so soft and is so golden. The sea is lovely and clear.
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,The water is so calm and clear. I have never been to a beach that was not packed with people. Everyone is so friendly. You can just snorkel around or get on your floaty and relax. Most of the people you meet have been coming here for years and now I can see why! We will be back for sure!
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,This is a great beach for just lounging and people watching. Easy enough to walk in for a swim. There is nothing to see snorkeling. The biggest drawback is on days when multiple cruise ships bring hoards of people there. Time your visit for a quieter weekend or late afternoon when the ships are leaving.
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,White sand turquoise water. Fun in the sun guaranteed ! Great for snorkeling. Beach umbrella's to rent for ten dollars. Not a lot of shade so these are a must. Restaurant is pricey unless you get the excursion through your cruise.
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,During this time of the year the beach was not too crowded. As you walked out further from the hotels it was very clean and silky to the touch. You must check it out for yourself!!!
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,We loved 7 mile beach. The water is so clear and safe to swim in(no under toe). The sand is soft! The beach is totally safe unlike Cabo.
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,Beautiful beach with soft sand and crystal clear blue ocean. Lots of loungers for rent at $5 each and umbrellas for same. Food and beverages available at Cailico Jacks; beers $6 each.
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,I loved the clear blue water and the friendly people. We took a taxi from our ship and then just spent the day at the beach. Inexpensive and relaxing!
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,the water is salty so watch out for your eyes but you can float easily. long walks- but there really are no spots to eat and drink along the beach- except for the resorts. all restaurants are on the street side.
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,I have only seen pictures where the water has been so blue and beautiful until I visited this beach You have to see it to believe it!
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,Perfect crystal clear water. Clean white sand. Blue sky and blue water and perfect weather . One word....Perfect
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,No better place to run than on this beach! Miles of pristine packed powder. Best run is before 10 or after 5 when the beach is not crowded.
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,A beautiful long beach but you have to find an entrance through a hotel or beach club. Royal Palms was too crowded. Would look around Buckingham's the next time.
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,Seven Mile Beach is very crowded due to the many high rise hotels and cruise ships coming into Grand Cayman. If you like the crowds stay on Seven Mile Beach; however the East End is the best to avoid the crowds.
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,Nothing to dislike plenty to like. Seven miles of sand with great snorkeling just off shore. Beautiful sunsets and pleasant breezes.
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,The sand is white and not full of rocks. The water is crystal clear. Fish swim right up to you. It was really fun.
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,If you're down with the Las Vegas strip you'll probably like 7 mile beach. Not my style. Nothing but shops tourists hawkers of local goods that have no appeal for me.
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,Enjoyed 7 mile beach at Tiki Beach Grand Cayman. A great place and great food. Only wish I could have stayed longer but it was exciting to be at one of the world's famous beaches.
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,Bus ride costs $1.50 a person each way. Bus comes by every 15-30 minutes. Rental chairs & umbrellas very reasonably priced.
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,We absolutely loved our day at this beach! There are many options to rent chairs eat and drink all along the beach. The sand is well groomed and the water is crystal clear and a beautiful turquoise. It's a great area for snorkeling  as well. We enjoyed it so much we plan on returning to spend another week here.
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,Loved the famous waterfalls people are friendly. We enjoyed Riu Hotels with in room liquor dispenser
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,The sand is just beautiful. When the sun shines on the water you can look out and see so many different colors of blue. It was just something to behold and so was the sunset
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,Wow we had so much fun at Seven Mile Beach. The water is cristal blue! The beach is beautiful not crowded plenty of space.
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,It is like true paradise with white sand and turoquise water... It is absolutely stunning and one of the best beaches in the caribbeans.
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,beach was clean and safe. we snorkeled everyday. chairs were easy to come by. pool is just steps away.
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,Although Mother Nature has not been kind the beach is still beautiful. Not as wide or as flat as it used to be it is still beautiful and the water is perfect! Fortunately they keep jet skis and motor boats away from the beach swimming areas.
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,I run every morning at the beachI love running on the sand it feel great! The beach is heavenly good pure white sand and the water is the most beautiful clean water
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,Perfect place to spend the day....paradise. Sand was really pink and the water was a beautiful turquoise blue.
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,The beach is beautiful too much traffic congested crowded. Not a snorkel spot. Limited by the hotel properties and poor parking options.
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,One of the prettiest clearest and cleanest beaches we have been on. Great for snorkeling. White sand turquoise water.
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,great beach for walking and several good snorkeling spots. Lots of resorts and apartment buildings along the beach . Warm water
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,i dont know...but i think this is the best beach in the world...everything is magic when you are here...try before die
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,
g147367,d2385044,February 8 2016,This is definitely one of the most beautiful beaches I've been to. Competes with eagle beach in Aruba. Warm turqoise water white sand.... No peddles either!) Got to go there to see it!!

g317146,d149676,March 3 2016,
g317146,d149676,March 2 2016,Visited three times in the week so we could go out fishing. When we went out fishing the morning view was absolutely stunning. A lot of people were swimming at the beach and snorkeling
g317146,d149676,March 2 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 29 2016,We are staying in Cabarete and decided to spend a few hours in Sosua. Different from Cabarete more people hawking products and restaurants and friendly people in general. Prefer Cabarete by far but a fun change of pace.
g317146,d149676,February 25 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,There is alot of prostitution on this beach but it does not trump the good quality drinks at the bars and the beautiful view
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,The high waves stopped us from going in most days. The beach was nice but you have to pay for an umbrella $3.00 us.
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,Well kept clean beach cliff jumping fishing and swimming. Good local deep sea fishing business sweet baby kittens some kind local dogs loaded with fleas cold beer bars umbrellas for rent all in all a good experience. Lots of "shops" and vendors but I didn't feel hounded.
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,Great spot for a swim. Leave your valuables with a friendly bar owner and return later for a cold beer.
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,This beach has some of the best snorkeling in the area. Very very clear and amazing coral. The beach is widely known for its scuba diving as well with many close dive sites that are terrific. Highly recommend spending a day here at least.
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,I relax with some friends at sosua beach and the water was just amazingly clear and warm. We don't nearly 7 hours at the beach where we did some shopping with local shops on the beach. I would really negotiate better prices than what are posted or offered. It was great relaxing atmosphere for young children and adults.
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,The beach is lined up with great vendors and shopping. They will provide chairs and umbrellas for only a few dollars. Best of all the water is so clear you can swim and snorkel right from the shoreline.
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,Nice scenery. This beach is better than Boca Chica. At Boca Chica the tours are very annoying. Here a no gracias is sufficient to have a tout move on. You can get cold drinks and decent food at any of the small restaurants along the beach.
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,I have been going to this beach for the past 5 years it s very nice and you can snorckel 200 feet from beach all the catamaran come here there is also all kind of vendors restaurant and mini bars expect to pay between 2 and 5 $ for a chair and umbrella for the day
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,This beach combines the locals what the tourist. A very clean beach with great food and great souvenir shopping.
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,Great beach and swimming. Lots of selection in bars and eats. A must go. Just realize its not South beach. Just have fun.
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,Something everyone should do visit the beach go to the disco. Walk the lands of Sousa it seems like it gets better and better
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,The best beach in the world amazing quite nice people always calm and near to everything you could need...
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,Great experience skuba diving. Guides are not over protective and provide you with the ability to experience the beauty that is Sosua. Beach boys can be a little bothersome but you get that in a lot of places in DR. The beach was amazing and water very clear.
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,Beautiful blue clear water  very busy with locals peddling items the food at the local Cantinas that line the beach is excellent with fresh caught seafood being grilled and served along the beach
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,I loved this beach!!! The water is crystal clear the weather is great and the local cafes provided the best local cuisine!!!
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,Very clean. Highly recommended. Took a day tour around this city with a rental car from Puerto Plato (only a 30 min drive.) worth it.
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,Probably one of the few beaches in the Dominican republic that has a sort of cultural authentic view and visitors area.
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,i love this beach the water is quite and clean. you can relax the whole day without getting harassed. a lot of drink and bar possibilities wihich offer all the same food. very nice public beach
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,Nice Beach. Sometimes the walking vendors can be a little bit pushy. Find a good spot with a nice lounge chair and good service and you really can't beat it. Avoid Sundays and Mondays. Sundays because it is 'family day' and the beach will be packed beyond all reason.......and Mondays because the beach is mostly still trashed from family day.
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,There are a few beaches in Sosua to visit this is probably more frequently visited by some of the locals as opposed to the tourists. Clear waters nice beach what else is there to say...
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,I highly recommend Playa Alicia as a place you must visit. It is very quiet spot no vendors trying to sell you things and crystalline water that you can where you are steppin' in.
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,Beautiful beach with amazing clear calm waters! We loved all of the wonderful restaurants and the fact that the water was so incredibly calm and serene. We took a glass bottom boat out a little ways and did some snorkeling as well. This is a terrific beach!
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,beautiful blue water calm good snorkeling Sundays are locals day so if you want quiet do not go on a Sunday! Or local holiday. if you want to see locals having a lot of fun no problem only may not have too much room Vendors a bit aggressive but if you are kind and FIRM there is no problem
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,Amazing view just needed a renovations to rooms and pool. And the maintenance people was very helpful. We definitely enjoyed the beach and jacuzzi in front of the ocean. Overall amazing resort and well recommended
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,The beach is just beautiful. Long nice beach.Lots of restaurants bars and lot's of people. Multi cultural. You can politely ask people NO thank you and they will leave you alone
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,There is lot of small shop and restaurant behind  they don' t disburb you...you can learn to dive see also with a botto glass boat etc...
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,nice clean long sandy beaches.. not over crowded.. they do charge 300 pesos for a umbrella even on the resort tho.
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,Nice beach maybe in the weekend too much crowdy It's full of small restaurants and bars to relax a bit!!!
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,Beautiful beach lots of market stools and things to see it is a long beach and very much fun the far end tends to be cheaper for chairs but not as nice. Watch some of the bar prices on drinks as they can be a lot higher.
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,Beautiful beach great place to visit with family and friends. Would recommend the waters are so clear and blue.
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,Been there several times since I was a little kid. This beach is so beautiful and and calm that you'll enjoy every moment you are there. There different establishments along the beach. Is not too far from Santiago or even samana. Enjoy a coconut under the shade or an iced cold beer
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,Los charamicos is sort of semi- public semi-private beach it offers some aquatic activities ( crazy banana boat snorkeling& Glass bottom boats) the sand & water are absolutely gorgeous nice place to get a tan food is very decent.
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,With the clearwater friendly people many activities and great food you can not good wrong here. The vendors are very polite and the beach is clean with clear blue. There are a few scam artists but not an overwhelming amount and it is expected in a public area. All in alll good fun for everyone.
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,Beach is shallow up to a certain distance from shore. The water is clear no seaweeds and some ordinary fish swimming. The waves are not strong and the beach has a sandy bottom.
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,Very friendly people relaxed in the sun for the day swam to the coral reef. shopping and food available
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,Went Snorkeling with My wife it was great Best service restaurant on beach is Big Mama and Best Restaurant off the beach is Caribbean Hot Spot
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,Oh my!! How delightful to enjoy warm breezes and cool clear water. If you visit one beach this year make it this one! It is very close to restaurants if you want to leave you chair. Otherwise somebody will bring your heart's desire to you everything from fresh shrimp to cold beer! Enjoy!
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,Beautiful beach close to dive sites. Lots of free lounges and parasols and with little hassle from vendors etc
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,It's one of my favourite...it doesn't look like paradise on earth ( who knows how paradise on earth looks like ?? ) but it's quiet not busy at all ( when we were there ) and yes you have palm trees and clear warm water if these are the signs you're looking about...and don't forget your snorkel gear !
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,Sosua beach keeps getting better each time we visit the water so clear and the beach so clean it seems the vendors are getting organized. There are new restaurants adding to the already good ones. Highly recommend it no wonder why we chose to stay in Sosua for a long time and never looked back :)
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,Beautiful beach!!!!! My biggest issue is vendors!!! Felt like a cow going in for the slaughter! To pushy! It got pretty annoying! You shouldnt feel stressed when going to the beach!!!
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,I have seen better beaches in spain!! Women fighting over who was braiding your hair. Find another beach elsewhere unless you like to be hassled.
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,Hanging with locals make this the World's best beach in my opinion Beach restaurants I recommend Rene's French for crepes find Tony Macaroni & he will keeps your drinks full and you out of the sun all day area 69 I think with free WiFi
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,Beautiful beach. Clean and well kept. Can see the new beautiful condos being built and some of the very nice hotels. There are always plenty of ventures to take from this beach
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,The beach is quiet but can be busy. There are places to eat and shop. The vendors are friendly and helpful. Prices are good.
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,Great beach. Lots of vendors and restaurants to choose from. Many watersport available. Love coming here to people watch. If you don't want to be bothered by the vendors simply walk on the side furthest from the stores and you seem to not get hassled so much.
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,beautiful blue water...massages available on the beach...very relaxing...plenty of "staff" to bring drinks or give information...
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,Nice swimming and snorkeling beach. Bring a banana and feed the fish. If you swim out to where the catamaran goes you can find some amazing fish and feed them. This was great...
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,

g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,The beach itself was beautiful. There was lots of food and shopping to be done right there along the beach. It wasn't overcrowded with people just enough to make the vibe a little more fun.
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,Nice beach easy to walk and swim. But not close to us at our hotel. Just cannot find 100 words for the beach. It was not easy for us to get back and forth and had to pay a taxi. The beach at our hotel was better
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,this beach is a must go! The water is clear. There are many restaurants by the beach. Food is super cheap and fresh. Drinks are cheap as well and delicious. everybody is super nice. the lobby can call a cab for you. locals and tourists are on the strip
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,the beach is beautiful. lots of white sand and blue water. but it is quite dirty and can be pretty crowded. lots of local food and drinks to enjoy but beware of vendors trying to sell touristy gifts on the beach.
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,One of the most beautiful beaches anywhere! You will find tons of food drinks and vendors with paintings and sculptures for sale. May be the best beach on the island to mingle!
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,The best way I can describe Sosua beach is to say it's the Coney Island of the D.R. It's everything you can think of. Lot's of people so therefore there are lot's of people trying to sell you something or have you come into their shop.
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,It was a 35 min drive from Lifestyle Resort but worth it. Get there early and bring pesos...you will purchase chairs & umbrella eat well get a massage mani/pedi and if you are adventurous they have snorkeling...Johnny took good care of us please go see him at the restaurant pictured below
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,Great Beach locals trying to sell you stuff but you can say no thanks. All excursions are cheaper and they will negotiate just ask
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,Great very nice clean beautiful place nice restaurant you will be back relaxing nice sunset you don't want to leave
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,We went snorkeling at this beach & it was amazing the beach is beautiful & the Chukka guides were very well prepared & safe and a lot of fun!
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,This is the most beautiful beach I have ever seen! Was only about 45 mins drive away from our resort in Puerto Plata. Sand was like gold and the sea was 95% visability. There is a large coral reef just off the shore!
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,If you are a single man Sasua will not dissapoint! Well worth the trip! The weather is perfect the seafood is fresh the nightlife is thriving and the women are gorgous!
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,It was awesome to walk to the beach and see all of the shops restaurants and bars. The locals were friendly and it was well worth the walk.
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,beautiful beach. was not very crowded had a lot of boats and water activities to do. The businesses on beach are pretty aggressive with getting you to purchase something or go out on boats but still enjoy the beach.
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,Some vendors are aggressively selling you but if you attach to a restaurant you can minimize the interactions. Take some extra pesos to help out some and understand that life is tough here- show respect and you will love every moment and be treated wonderfully!
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,Great time with great friends! Loved everything about Dominican Republic can't wait to go back. Fresh fish cook on beach. Foot massage from Teresa! Ice cold Presidente....Lolo
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,While the bay/beach/snorkeling are lovely the hot crowded dirty beach is gross. All of the hawkers trying to sell you a space to sit and eat...loud music. Really a miss other than the snorkeling. Best to take a boat excursion there and snorkel that way.
g317146,d149676,February 24 2016,Had a great time on the beautiful sosua beach. Water was nice and clear did a bit of snorkeling and enjoyed the heat as we are from northern Ontario Canada where the winters are long and cold.
g317146,d149676,February 22 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 22 2016,Great beach. Good for lunch tourism and families. Lots of shops and restaurants close to downtown. Pretty decent prices lotsa locals. Fun fun fun! Enjoy good drinks and good food.
g317146,d149676,February 21 2016,Great way to experience local culture on a beautiful beach! Vendors will rent you chairs and then serve food and drinks (for a fee!)
g317146,d149676,February 21 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 17 2016,Vendors and markets and not too sure about safety of your belongings. Great snorkeling.This is the calmest of all the beaches in the area there is lots of coral and fish to see.
g317146,d149676,February 16 2016,Beautiful beach a few nice little restaurants tons of pushy vendors that are all selling the same stuff...😝
g317146,d149676,February 16 2016,Sunday is the best day if you want to see a lot of people. All other days are good not a lot of traffic. Hecklers will heckle you to come into their stores but just keep moving. They are nice people. Clean and friendly folks.
g317146,d149676,February 15 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 13 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,Cold beer served right to your chair (for a small rental fee). Check out the Reggae Lounge for authentic Jamaican food. It will be the highlight of your beach trip to Sosua.
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,Great shops food water activities. Scuba boat tours and tube rides. Seat rental available. You will always meet interesting people here ha
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,The Sosua beach was beautiful.It has alot of shops to buy souvieners and you can bargain with them.For the most part they are not overly pushy but obviously they all want you to buy something.There was alot of people there because it was easter.
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,Snorkelling near the reef was absolutely amazing. We saw many different types of fish and plant growth.
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,clubs were crowded and exciting. Hotels were very convenient and cheap.Food was all right.Everything in this town is within walking distance so it is not necessary to rent a car.
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,Got my hair braided and a massage! Prepare to be hustled but once you buy an umbrella and chair you can just relax and enjoy a day on a nice beach.
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,

g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,The undertow was strong. Not a good swimming beach in our area. But an absolutely beautiful setting for a destination wedding. The kids of beach you would love to stroll down in the evening.
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,We enjoyed the beautiful beaches food and so many beautiful places to see that Dominican has to offer non of which we would have know existed with out our tour guide Angelo Zamparutti from SpeedyRodriguez Taxi Tours
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,Nice beach but everything is a shakedown. The cigar guy the lounge chair guys the kiosk guys. Know your prices before and then negotiate hard. Never take the first offers. But it does pay to have your lounge guy help you keep the others away and he can get you drinks and food too.
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,Beautiful beach if you want a chair and umbrella you have to pay for them. Lots of shopping bars and food along the beach.
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,love beach great stores and always great place to relax. Love going there listening music and watching girls walk by.
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,We didn't actually go to the beach but we took a catamaran ride out from Playa Dorada. The water was very clear and the coral reefs were full of fish...the boat experience was great as well. Captain put up the sails for the ride back. A fun day!
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,Beautiful coral reef. Lots of little shops lining the beach area selling trinkets. The vendors are persistent so every few shops I would stop and have a look.
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,Not great for small children as the waves were crashing near the shore . The week we were there the flag was mainly yellow to red. Which indicated swim at you own risk or undertows . No lifeguard on the beach .
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,Sosua beach is paradise the water the people the service from restaurants all were great and even found a side of beach where I could just relax and not be disturb by people trying to give massage on the beach
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,this beach is beautiful. we walked from the condo we were staying in. the people were very friendly and always willing to bargain. the beach was beautiful. soft sand and clear blue waters.
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,Loved the beds on the beach and had the best shrimp dish ever at restaurant on beach. Beware of the friendly locals they will haggle you for a sale. If interested you can get deals on souvenirs.
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,Beautiful ocean views shops rist with local items and tourist goodies places to eat. Great foods at a great price. Places to relax in the shade.
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,This is where all the vendors sell their wares. It is worth the trip if you are looking for souvenirs. Everything for you is "almost free"...lol...There are also some restaurants along the route - worth stopping for a drink.
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,We made the mistake of visiting the beach at about 4:00 and it was definitely transitioning to a sketchy atmosphere. I had one cuba libre that had too much rum in it to even finish and we left. Having said that it is in a protected cove with nice water so it might be lovely earlier in the day.
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,Great Place daytime. Daytime - enjoy various restaurants the beach and people watching! Avoid at night time! at night time the Sosua Beach completely changes character into a seedy "back street" with prostitution and overconsumption of alcohol and such. Avoid!
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,This is a great spot to have lunch and a few drinks but unfortunately the bill came double what it should have been - a lot of add on costs for tourists
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,Beach was nice but the area behind the beach is all pushy vendors and a lot of prostitutes with older men
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,One of my favoirte beach hangouts....best for those that like to interact woth locals. Not for families or isolationists.
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,Sosua beach is a very nice place to sit and enjoy a cool libation and enjoy the fantastic views. The sunsets are very nice. It is a vibrant place with lot's of activity
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,The public beach is quite beautiful with lots to do and a public market that will keep you busy as well.
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,You can swim or snorkel around. Then have a coco loco and the all over again. Trees give a perfect shade.
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,Food is cheap night life is good beaches are ok. Beaches get crowded cars and motor bikes driven by locals pretty dangerous
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,It was clean and the water was calm. A bit cooler than I personally like. The only shade were the chair with umbrellas. No natural shade on the beach.
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,This is the beach to enjoy a calm day reading swimming a snorkeling if you wish. Walk straight down to the shore from the parking lot to avoid the vendors. Toms Scandinavian Bar ribs are a must. Pass on the Mojitos. The Presidentes are more refreshing.
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,Great place to meet people without getting hassled too much. I have been ther 10 times in the last 11 years.
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,The beach was very nice till it rained the shops were plentiful the women were sexy just wish it didn't rain
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,The food is varied and great. The beaches filled with beautiful women. The water always warm and clean. Relaxing and very little hustling of the tourist.
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,get ready to be swarmed by market people beautiful scenery get a message a table and a beer and relax
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,Sosua Beach is a neat little beach shopping strip but oh my lord one gets tired of repeating "No gracias" to every vendor along the strip.
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,great beach many of the locals come here so you see a really nice part of the local life and diversity aswell many of the restaurants are local food eats some bbq some pure dominican aswell alot of neat local gift shops.AMAZING VIEW OF THE CITY
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,I love the beach the water was very mild and warmDid not like all the vendor up from the beach so if go to Sosua Beach just stay walking on the beach. and don't sit down on a chair if you do you have to pay for it.
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,Busy pretty crystal waters activities on beach small area bars on ledge gave nice view of beach
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,Visited the beach again on my latest visit to sosua and it was just as good as always ...stopped at the sons of anachy bar and had a few drinks ...we were made to feel extremely welcome and relaxed for a few hours before moving on this beach is defo worth taking your time to visit
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,Sosua Beach used to be fantastic. It has lost sand looks dirty and is bordered by an abandoned hotel. Desperately needs TLC. Not recommended unless you only want to drink beer and pick up hookers.
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,If you want the hustle massagers shops hawkers go to Sosua playa. If not playa Alicia is more quit and more beautiful.
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,I love this beach it is amazing the water is so clear. I highly recommend scuba diving to see the reef (scuba is enough as water is very shallow).
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,We stayed at Puerto Plata and the beach wasnn't really nice! So we went to Sosua Beach! There you can get really carribean feeling! The beach is very nice and you can see a very beautiful sunset! There are nice shopping possibilities and comfortable bars and restaurants! So you can spend a nice day at beach!
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,Loved the shopping and the restaurants and the staff was great It was close to the resort so we were able to take our time during the day
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,Plenty of loungers and interesting array of beach sellers who moved on as soon as you said no didn't get consistently harassed. Good selection of beach cafes and shops would recommend an afternoon here to everyone.
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,Really not kidding - every step you take on this beach you are being targeted as a buyer. It got very annoying FAST. The beach is beautiful but the food stands on the strip did not look clean. We found a spot owned by an Italian gentleman with great pasta - wish I could remember the name.
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,Lots of shade and a stunning beach. My favorite stop on the beach is the Tropicana ran by Josh about 1/2 down the beach. He makes award winning spaghetti and perfect drinks for excellent prices.
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,Took my family SCUBA diving. My daughter and I are certified. We have been diving there for many years However the reef is dyeing. It isn't as colorful
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,Sosua beach is the jewel of the North Coast set in a golden sand bay rimmed by green trees and blessed by crystal clear waters and good snorkeling spots. There are many restaurants bars and gift shops there many run by Europeans and Canadians. A must visit if traveling to the North Coast.
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,Beautiful white sand beach. Good for snorkeling and swimming. You can swim out to a coral reef and feet bananas to the fish. Some nice souvenir stands on the beach. Most stands sell the same items (wood carved statues) and the touts can be rather annoying.
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,Stay away from the back and walk along the beach by the water- beautiful sun sea and sand! Also buy some fruit from the locals- very yummy!!!
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,this was a great beach with fun food and activitiesgreat little shops line the beach....................... so much fun
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,I loved it!!! I had a great time in the beach area. Would recommend it to anyone!!! Nice time to spend alone and with company!!!!
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,The beach is very beautiful in Sosua. This was my third time visiting. There is a lot of unsavory activity going on in front of the many small shops as night falls.
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,Sosua is stricktlyfor singles many activities food resturants nice people pleasant able to get transport to attracttions.Weather very nice Beach o.k. as well
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,Beaches were clean water was warm and Diving was great wonderful Dive Master. First dive 52 feet and second 37 feet visability 75 percent. Plenty of fish to see and swim with boat ride was very relaxing water was calm.
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,the view was spectacular and the drive around town you get to see the poor and the rich lots of photos and people trying to sell you stuff.
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,We stayed in Cabarete it was hard to get to without taking a taxi everyday. We stayed at Ocean Resort which had no activities or amenities.
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,just dont bother its really not worth the time and effort I would deffinately not recommend. bit seedy and full of money grabbers
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 12 2016,Sosua is one of the most popular beaches in Puerto Plata and with good reason. But sometimes it is too overcrowded for my liking.
g317146,d149676,February 10 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 11 2016,The beach itself is nice. The locals that hang around and harass you to buy stuff non stop put a damper on things. I would spend my time in Cabarete far sooner than I would go back to Sosua.
g317146,d149676,February 10 2016,definitely one of the prettiest beaches i have been to in the Caribbean. there are beach side bars and restaurants nestled back in the trees along with typical junk shops
g317146,d149676,February 10 2016,A gorgeous beach in the Dominican Republic as like most others the water is blue the sands are soft . Is not a very large beach so its recommended to go out early to get yourself a lounging chair if you intend on tanning
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Very nice and clean  always a chair and friendly people. please check it out when you are there. Very nice.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,This is my favorite spot in Sosua. With the reef a little ways out in the bay the waves are not overly strong and the water is clear and warm. Beautiful!
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Sosua beach is a nice place to unwind and relax. The only negative is that there are a lot of pushy hustlers trying to sell garbage at high prices. Ignore them and you'll be fine.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Gentle waves no undercurrent. Clear water soft beige sand. Lots of beach huts: bars souvenirs clothes art etc Very colorful!
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Beach is pretty with many shopsrestaurants and bars. Some water sports fishing scuba snorkelling banana boats etc. Great people watching
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,very nice beach a lot of restaurant of different countrysouvenirs bar and of course a lot of tourist mix with the local sunday is the best day familiesfriend best spot for fish and rhum
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Very enjoyable and once seated in a chair very peaceful! The water and ambiance was just perfectly Caribbean!
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Excellent safe trustworthy clean close to downtown. Resort excellent we will go again. We went walking downtown day and evening. Listed as 3.5* I give it 5*. I can't wait to take my kids and friends Thx Jan Medeiros
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Beautiful water but filthy looking low life people all over Sosua. More hookers than you could ever imagine
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,the beaches are beautiful beware of pickpockets and prostutes.Food at the beaches was fantasticand it is always fun to negotiate with the vendors
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Liked the restaurants on the beach and the food I ate. The beach is nice. Nicer than Orchard Beach in the Bronx
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,been to the DR for many years and if you want a fun day trip go to sosua. Great beaches nice restaurants and shopping without the hassles in Puerto Plata
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,This beach is stunning with plenty of his or quiet and relaxing well worth a visit. The sand was very hot.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,The snokeling was really good and the catamaran trip to and from had just the right amount of water splashes. A good breakup from beach and golf
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Well worth a visit nice beach and lots of shops to visit bars and restaurants lots of vendors too but there are OK every one understand a friendly but firm no.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Did not actually go on the beach but people told us it was nice. Only viewed it from a distance. Not many shops. We only found approx 4. Lots of bars. Needs an update.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,they will send you up a wall and then over it lol but then you gotta realize they're just trying to make a living. i barely saw beach for 2 days because vendors kept following me but i figured it out. beach was nice not enough chairs though hardly any!
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Went to Sasua Beach to go Scuba Diving in 2003 an brilliant day but watch out for the braking waves when you get out of the boat. The beach gets quit deep close to the shore. Be ready to haggle at the market stalls on your way down to the beach.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,We took a day trip here to get away from our resort beach and had a pretty good time. There were a lot of locals trying to sell you crap on the beach or rent you chairs but overall it was a pretty good experience. Don't bring anything valuable with you here. It felt a little shady.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Hotel was beautiful and so was the swim up bar. The beach is gorgeous white sand and plenty of it! Take a tour guide downtown at night....guaranteed some excitement!
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,If you travel to north dominican you cannot go home without seeig Sosua Bay its absolutely beautiful the waters are so clear and warm and the diving is amazing.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,great swimming fun encounter and snorkeling with Beta great service and just beautiful scene. You have to experience it to appreciate it.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Amazing beach. We went during the week so it was not packed with tourists. Clean area and gorgeous surroundings. Great full body massage for 500 pesos!
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,It's like being in a jungle rows and rows of funky markets and restaurants and bars and great people great beach
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Near by Reef and other resort there the beach is public and kinda huge for the area. IF you are looking for a place to relax and enjoy some time.. I think that's a good place to start
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,This beach was amazing when you go to the dominican you have to check this place out! The water was crystal clear lots of places to buy gifts food drink etc. loads of water sport activities. Great place!!
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Went to this beach to scuba dive for the first time and was not disappointed it was a great experience and started my love of snorkeling in other holiday resorts.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,I went 7 years ago when it was alive... this year we took the boat to paradise Island there but the place is dead. Not much to do or see anymore
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,We went to Sosua Beach to get on catamaran. The water is clear and great for snorkeling. Lots of pretty fish.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Beautiful beach with a flea market. Beautiful white sand and a clear blue sea. Good for swimming and snorkelling. Very clean.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,I really liked this beach. I enjoyed all of the vendors that came up with fresh foods and drinks. The Banana Boat was great! We tried this Pina Colada inside of a pineapple OMG! So Strong and SO good.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,like everythingexcept the vendors coming to you so you can buy stuff from their store all over you  i don' like that.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Great beach crystal clear sea great day out. Highly recommendedfor boyhood couples and families. The beach is clean.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,We went snorkeling here and it's the optimal site for this activity. The clearest waters we've ever seen! It's also very peaceful there.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Crystal clear water. Great for the beginner snorkeler because you can literally swim 10 yards into the water and find small reefs.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Fish & Tostones on the beach! Then get a body massage and get a tarot reading and take a banana adventure ride on the water...Ahhh so good!
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Crystal clear waters and white sand! Worth a visit!! Beach vendors a little annoying! We went as part of an excursion but would go back as a day out!
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Gorgeous beach! CleAn! Had lunch here too and was delicious! Fresh crab also had fresh prawns on the beach lovely! Would recommend a day out here'
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,The main beach of Sosua is so beautiful. Great also for snorkeling and diving. The beach area also offers plenty of bars restaurants and gift shops. I came here in summer 1985 the first time and till today I love i there.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,The beach and people are BEAUITFUL! Everyone was so helpful and friendly! The beach vendors weren’t pushy and they gave great deals. The restaurants on the beach were delightful and tasteful! All the food was fresh and cooked as ordered! A great first time experience!
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,I visited this place for the first time and I can say I like the view of the beach and the enviromment around.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Beautiful beach and pretty good snorkling and diving for the area. I wish I would have spent a little more time there checking out the restaurants and shops in the area but I was there for diving so I didn't have a chance to do that much
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,We paid 600 pesos for a cab from Puerto Plata and 100 pesos for a beach chair. The beach was clean pretty and lots of loals were there. It is less crowded on weekdays. Good place to buy souvenirs also.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,The stops we made were incredibly beautiful unlike anything I have ever seen before! You get breakfast then lunch at the second stop and drinks throughout the hole excursion.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,this is a great beach to visit i loved it it like a pool on the sea i would definitely go back and the drinks and food here is good too
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Sosua Beach is great for the whole family. It has a lot of restaurants shopping areas and bars. The beach is clean clear water and you can do some water activities if you are looking to try extreme stuff.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Beautiful resort and beaches for diving. We used the Aqua Dive Centre which were excellent. We sailed along the coast and viewed all the beautiful properties and hotels. A peaceful day out.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Beautiful white sandy beach with the clearest of water small fish swimming around your ankles; fantastic day out. Be careful of the shops there though as they are very pushy!
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Beautiful white sand and clear water perfect for snorkelling. Lots of local shops and restaurants. Well worth a visit
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,AMAZING experience with Free Style Catamaran Tours!! Highly HIGLY recommend! We were in DR for one week and it was the BEST DAY by FAR!
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,The water is beautiful and protected for some amazing snorkeling. The smells from the restaurants are intoxicating. Unfortunately while I was in the water for maybe 20 minutes my waterproof wallet was broken into and all my US dollars were stolen. Luckily they left my driver's license and credit card and my iPhone.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Sosua is a great local beach to go to. Expect to pay for your chair and umbrella. A lot of beach vendors. Great market for bargaining and souvenirs. Good place to hang with locals enjoy a reall dring in a Coconut or Pinapple and enjoy the beautiful water.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,I went to Sosua for a weekend. In this little island beach town you'll enjoy the food and the warm friendly atmosphere...and love the gorgeous beaches .
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Snorkeling over rocks right off the beach further out in the bay there are large rocks and cliffs with coral. Coral and fish are not too colorful and not too plentiful compared to other places we have dove/snorkeled but the visibility and warm water are amazing in Sosua Bay!
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Snorkelling and scuba diving is fantastic! Take plenty of bread a fruit to feed the fish! Take a waterproof disposable camera with you!
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Not as bad as Boca Chica but you WILL be hustled for food lounge chairs umbrellas and drinks unless you bring your own. On the other hand come prepared and it can be quite pleasant. Great variety of food and other items for purchase no waves to speak of.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,The snorkeling was great. The vendors on the beach were pests and the bathroom was more than sketchy and you had to pay a lady to let you use the sketchy bathroom!
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Beautiful relaxing water. If you're a beach lover you will love coming here. Did snorkeling here and the fishes were marvelous to see.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Visited Sousa as part of a VIP outback safari it was lovely sea was warm and clear with fishes swimming around your feet. The beach is like a proper Caribbean beach lovely and white sand.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Best beach at the dominican republic. Great service at the scandinavian bar on the beach. Good food and great drinks. Much better than the hotels.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,We took a catamaran tour over to Sosua Beach. It was picture perfect white sands crystal clear warm water & plenty of fish to see while snorkeling. Definitely worth the visit!
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,If your on the north coast Sosua beach is a decent beach well protected and good for snorkelling but has way to many vendors . If you want a decent beach day skip Sosua and get to Cabarete beach way nicer  lots of restaurants and all though has vendors who bug you too. Not as many as sosua.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Awesome beach crystal clear calm waters with friendly locals. The scuba tours are very affordable and if you are traveling with kids there are a few water activities such as the banana boat ride and being pulled on a float by a small boat. Great few days at the beach.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,My trip to Sosua beach was amazing as always and great atmosphere. Gorgeous calm blue sea. Had a rum n coke in the ocean and caught some sun!!! Perfect. Ate amazing food on beach front too. Perfect day out
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,An above average beach in a quaint town that isn't fully infected with tourism...yet. If you're in Puerto Plata this beach should be a must-visit especially because it's merely a 20-minute drive away.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,I got an apartment in Sosua because the beach town and people are second to none - what of the most amazing places in the country!!
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Went to this beach twice during my 13 day Dominican retreat. Sosua hosts some of the most beautiful waters in the Dominican Republic. You can relax in the water grab a bite to eat or drink here. I would definitely recommend a pineapple filled with rum punch after you've gotten a chance to take a dip.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,The colour's of the fish are unreal and such vivid in colour. Take a banana or bread with you and you will have them eating out your hand. Waters warm and calm for snorkelling even for me a a novice
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Nice place beatifull and clean beach excelent food yo can get there the best sunset ever! Yo can have relax come with friends or family
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Took a trip here via catamaran to snorkel! Amazing place to snorkel with interesting fish coral and clear water! Had a great day!
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Wonderful beach good snorkeling barter with the boat captains and they will take you out for a tour lots of great people to meet and good food to eat.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,This beach is located in a cove and has snorkelling paddle boarding banana boat and glass bottom boat rides....or do nothing at all and browse the more then 200 beach vendor shops and lounge with a cool one on the beach.....life is good in Sosua!
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,you must try Big D's (chicken & ribs) and Moshy's (Jamican food & smooties) on the beach they both serve great food I would eat there again I truly enjoyed the food the atmosphere and the staff
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,a beautiful clean white sand with crystal turquoise water!! Beach was breathtaking!!! Didn't want to leave!!!
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,The beach is 1km long and full of bars and places to eat not to be missed but gets crowded on Sundays with bus loads of locals. Good for swimming snorkeling and a great place to chill on a sun lounger with a cold beer.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,The snorkeling was okay. We did buy our best priced tourist souvenirs there on the beach. Do negotiate! They get a better exchange than you so you might do best in dollars. Bring way more ones and fives than you think you will ever need.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,I went to Sosua Beach to do some snorkeling. The beach is amazing snorkeling was great and there are lots of little shops where one can shop.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Vendors harras you up and down . theres prostitutes walking up and down. there is a rib place here that i had and has the best ribs I've ever had i recommend it its one of the last stores on the strip and features a signature homade jack daniels BBQ sauce.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,This was amazing the fish we saw truly breathtaking. My daughter with the guides assistance swam between the coral reef. She told me it was wonderful!
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Sosua is a beach like non other. Tropical trees grow out of the sand. Vendors stroll the beach offering fresh shrimp to handmade bracelets but respect when you say no. Locals play dominoes guitars strum lots of 'regulars' and the bay is beautiful.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,T.he many different options that Sosua beach offers from swimming snorkeling fishing or just plain relaxing with many food options
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Great beach. Lots of people & things to buy. If you like bbq check out Big D . Be aware prostitution is rampant so there are many lounging & hanging around. They don't bother you but for kids I wouldn't bring mine there. For adults it's all fun!
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,It is a nice beach to walk but beware of the vendors they are very pushy and do not leave you alone. They do not know what NO means. Water is clear and nice for swimming just beware
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,There are over 100 vendors and restaurants featuring all kinds of cuisines. Prices are reasonable and you can get wifi. Go early to get a good seat.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Living here I do go occasionally to the Beach...many small restaurants and bars on the beach. I love to go with my husband and just sit watch the water and have a drink
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,the beachb had a lot of people on it a lot of dogs just wandering around.the beach and the venders. we looked at some of the outside resturaunts they looked good a couple we met said sinatras was very good and also captain jacks
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Was clean hot fun lots off people good chairs the beach attendees were very helpful there lots of place to put garbage.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,I was there on Wednesday and the beach i first visited has changed no longer family friendly the beach is eroded and loaded with venders and prostitutes not worth the trip to the beach.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Have been to the Dominican Republic so many times as we love the place. Sousa is not a brilliant resort. We stopped here for a couple of hours on a day trip. Would not book here for a full holiday.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Worth the drive to go there beautiful beach and scuba area. Vendors were pretty aggressive to try to sell stuff.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,beautiful beach and ocean  quiet and chilled. locals are helpfull not too pushy if your firm. the sun hits this beach all day so no need to chase the sun
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,I liked the calmness of the water but there were dirty diapers floating and water had alot of garbage in it and no one there to clean it up.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Went with Tip Top Catamaran Excursion. Spent a nice day saling and snokelling. Lunch and drinks included
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,went scuba diving there two days which was wonderful took the Freestyle catermeran out there to snorkel another day and spent another day there walking the shops and bars. Something for everyone!
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Sosua Beach was beautiful -- like a postcard. Lots to do -- parasailing waveriding canoeing volleyball shops cafes etc. The sand was powdery and the water was warm. The waves were a little choppy from all of the activity and wind. Probably not the quietest beach but beautiful nonetheless.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,The beach was very nice but the SCUBA diving left a lot to be desired. The shop keepers were not pushy at all.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Sosua Beach is tranquil yet exciting place to visit! Beautiful rock formations set the scene off to the distance with beautiful sandy beach..and crystal clear water!
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,I compare beaches to Waikiki and others on Oahu so this one is ok but nothing special. Of course the beach is cleaned every morning by staff otherwise the coconuts and palm leaves would be right beside you.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Great place to purchase souvenirs on the beach enjoy a meal at Jorge's Restaurant about midway down the beach Great for Snorkeling and Scuba Diving
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,I came here for a 3 hour snorkeling adventure and it was a fascinating experience. The water was so warm (compared to that of NY) and incredibly clear. To actually swim with these fish and feed them was an experience I would never forget.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,This is a beautiful beach with lots of shops to purchase almost anything you want. Plenty of little food places and drinks. There are lots of loungers on the beach for when you want to lay out in the sun - boat rides etc.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,instead of a cab adventure and take the bus they have small restaurants there and shops take a swim to the riffs that's were the boats take you to see the colorful fish that is so abundant in this particular area
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Sosua is like a poor man's Pattaya in Thailand. A ton of women dressed in very tight clothes procuring all manner of services and a bunch of old fat men looking to buy. The beach is nice but has been over-toured -- so the coral is pretty much dead and the fish are well trained.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,The beach was really clean and the water was crystal clear. We drank from a pineapple and had some cashews on the beach.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,This beach has many shops with all the souvenirs you could want. The sales people are very pushy to the point of being offensive. The beach is sheltered and calm great place for the kids if not for the for women selling themselves. I would not go back.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,A picture-perfect beach with great off-the-beach snorkeling (ignore offers of boat trips - just swim out about 50m and you are in the midst of spectacular live coral). Had lunch in a small beach restaurant - spectacular bbq red snapper in wine sauce.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,We went on a "booze cruise" snorkeling trip to Sosua. The snorkeling was ok but not up to the standards that I have learned to expect. Not much coral some interesting fish but not an abundance. The highlight of the day was on the surface when a group of about 50 flying fish came flying by.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Fishing and snorkeling can be had inexpensively in this town. Hotels that I've seen were low end. Lots of bars and hookers running around.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,This is a dark sanded beach not the best looking. Also alot of coral and reef unsafe to swim in some parts. Water was not clear either.. a little scary because very busy w/ locals and businesses. Will get hasseled
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,The beach was clean and the food vendors took care of us all day brought out tables and chairs and actually put linen cloths on the tables for our deliciously fresh seafood lunch. Look for Johnathan.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Be careful. There are huge rocks under water that you may get hurt on if you are not aware of them.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Great Place for diving even if you are not a diver. Fun to fead the fishes With banana. A very Nice little town.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,if you r ok to go total immersion. with the flavors attached to it its a must go for an afternoonwith a great cheap lunch and cold presidente
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Vendors on beach won't stop. We just walked the length of the beach stopped every minute. The town was nice and no one approached us. Perhaps in the busy season you wouldn't be the whole focus of attention
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Loved Sosua a small fishing village with a beautiful beach! Was awesome to see the fishing boats coming in with lots of fish caught. Had a delicious Dominican lunch right on the beach. Nice town to walk thru with shops and cafes.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Beautiful waters and views. Once you come to an understanding with the somewhat aggressive vendors/restauranteurs it is a fabulous place to hang all day. The sand is super soft and the water very calming.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,The beach at Sosúa is very beautiful with clean water. Many tiny waterside restaurants eager to supply you with beach chairs drinks and food. Friendly people; spoke to a lot of locals in water and on beach. Vendors not pushy. Had great fish for lunch.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,This is one of the wildest beaches on earth. I would call it The Thailand of the Carribean. Vendors hookers beach bums etc
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,The water was very clear and blue here. There wasn't a lot of space for seating. but we had a wonderful time scuba driving and snorkeling here.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Way busier than when we visited twenty years ago but still a pleasant place to hang out eat some grilled fish and have a dip.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Good snorkeling beach. You can get food and be served while you kick back in lounge chairs. There is also a long row of shops right on the beach where you can pick up local items to take home. Everything will be over priced you can always get them to lower the prices considerably.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Beach was absolutely beautiful! Played in the waves for hours. Ate at a Scandinavian place with flags outside the hut. Food was fantastic. Even had a pineapple drink in the pineapple. Not expensive at all. Cool tourist shopping area as well. Liked everything about it.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,I liked the beach and the snorkelling is great. Lots of street vendors. A few hotels are closed and I think the economic situation is not very good. Definetly worth a visit.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Beautifully bay we went diving from with seapro divers there on the Internet  the sea was flat calm at this bay and nice sandy beachthere's a few places to get drinks and a couple of shops . The wreck is a 10 min boat ride out from here which was a great dive .
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,If you are looking for solitude beach at PuertoPlata is for you. If you are looking for numerous beach bars vendors fabulous food and atmosphere beyond belief SosuaBeach is your place. Words cannot describe take a deep breath and walk down the steps to the beach. A true Kerouac or Hemingway experience awaits!
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,It is a very pretty beach. Decent-sized waves. There is an open-air market on the hill above. When we visited though there were an awful lot of sea urchins. The spines are quite painful. Bring water shoes.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Sosua Beach is a small crescent shaped beach well protected with calm water. There are lots of restaurants to choose from and you can eat at tables on the beach. The banana boat ride is lots of fun for children and adults. Usually there will be musicians walking along the tables to serenade you.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,We came here after an all-inclusive on Playa Dorada. GORGEOUS waters but the prices are definitely tourist prices (high for Peruvians)! Still very calm and enjoyable. Warning that prostitution is common here older foreign men seem to come for that. If you can ignore it no problem but maybe not great for kids.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Took a snorkeling tour off Sosua Beach and it was spectacular. The fish come right up and eat out of your hands (bananas and bread from a bottle). I have snorkeled before but nothing like this experience! Loved it!
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,I took a snorkeling trip and our last stop was this beach. It toally lives up to its reputation and it has a beautiful coral reef not 50 ft from shore. We swam to shore when we were done for our ride back to our resort.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,the beach was very nice local folks were great food there as very good at night  the place comes alive
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Try the local shops in the area to buy your gifts for your friends and family cheaper then the hotels.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,A paradise either for surfer windsurf bodyboard or kitesurf. There are also enough places to eat and chill out having a nice cocktail.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,A great place to be with the locals. Lots of shops and places to eat. Really fun and shady! Music water and just fun. Sort of hard to find. But right off the main drag in Sosua. Must do if you visit Sosua.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,The beach was stunning sand was extremely hot take suitable shoes. We had lunch in a local bar food was great and great service very friendly people.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,This beach was a great place to land. Beautiful setting. This was our most traveled beach only because of the clear water and pristine shore. Sooo many pictures.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,we bought a package from Cofresi Palm to snorkle for half a day and the beach and reef we went to was off Sosua. Great beach!
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,The water is the perfect temperature and crystal blue! Make sure you bring your goggles because the aquatic life is amazing and you can see it all so well! We even found living sand dollars when we swam out far enough. Most restaurants will rent you a beach chair with purchase of food. Don't forget the sunscreen!
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,This beach had great sand no merchants on the beach and had great service from boats restaurants and tours. The night life was filled with Dominican and Haiti girls. It was really a great get away from the busy city of Puerto Plata and the load craziness of my hotel resort.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,well worth a visit very small beach with white sand and amazing clear water. Lots of shops near by where you can buy local artists work and jewellery loved it here!
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Snorkling was great. Beach ambience not to my liking. Too many hawkers and people jostling around even during the day time.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,the beach is great  rent chairs and they watch your stuff get pinapple drinks food all on the beach  the waves are so high it is loved by all......going back
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Enjoyed the blue crystal waters of Sosua beach and enjoy eating fresh Fish on the beach or beach front while having a cold prsidente Beer.........
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Nelson was our dive master and our family of six enjoyed two terrific dives. He and Eddie took us out in a boat for just a short distance. Visibility was very good probably about 50 feet and we saw lots of fish on the coral reefs. Bring bread to feed the fish.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Fab place for snorkelling and diving. Can feed the vast quantity of fish here too. Water clarity is excellent and a great safe place to snorkel. Most of the hotels have trips available for snorkelling or via catamarran.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,I loved the beach and water but got tired of the constant vendor harassment -- after awhile I just stopped responding. They DO seem to back off if you just give a quick "no gracias. adios"
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,This place was awesome. Great clear water for snorkeling. It was my first time and was able to share it with 2 of my best friends. So nice.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Its ok the wave are strong certain time of the year they have food and bathroom available $$ also beers they are a lot of prostitution. The way on top of the beach has souvenir store and its a nice walk.my day there was nice only down thing was someone stole my skirt.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Loves the clearness of the water the lounge chairs and tables were not free they charge 100 pesos or $2.50 For the rental there's a guy named Super Mario who takes your drink and food order and there are vendors along the beach that sell everything from souvenirs to sugar cane! Loved it
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,This is the best beach in my opinion its very beautiful white sand clear water it gets very crowded with locals on sundays or holidays but the rest of the days are very calm and enjoyable!
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,it is much like grand bend or sauble beach here in ontario. except way more prostitutes!!!! I have never seen so many or been propositioned so much in my life!!! good prices off the resort and lots of crafts ect. good shopping.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Very quaint beach popular with German tourists and lots of snorkelling and diving available here. Plenty of beachside stalls full of everything you don't need and sellers aren't too pushy if you say no politely.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,if your resort has its own beach there is no need to go to this one. this is a smaller beach enjoyed by the local community. limited shopping - flea market style
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Disliked the beach sellershad to pay to rent a lounger and then harassed to buy odd things. Liked seeing something outside of the resort so the break was nice. The coral reef was fun to snorkel but nowhere near as good as Paradise Island.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,I've been going to Sosua for as long as I can remember. I believe its one of the best beaches around the Puerto Plata area. Clean waters nice sand and pretty safe overall. Would definitely if one is looking to spend a afternoon is paradise.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,It was beautiful! & Not too expensive. You could rent chairs tables umbrellas they brought drinks to us on the beach We had fries beer rum rented all equiptment above. The total was only around 800 pesos. I cant wait to go back.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Many of the Dominicans prefer this beach as it is one of the first and everyone is very pleasant to deal with. Many little restaurants on the water and plenty of umbrellas and chairs to rent at a very reasonable rate.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,dirty beach and big waves most have the time its a locals beach lots have vanders you have to pay for your chair
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Overrated crazy busy alot of store fronts and little restaurants. Beach was calmer however. You have to pay for chairs and umbrellas and beach itself was quite short.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,The views are fantastic the shops and vendors are great the multitude and diversity of the restaurants and food is unbelievable....the water is crystal clear and warm!!

g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Beautiful water not so crowded beach plenty of activities (swim snorkel dive banana boat fish...) and good food and drinks... What not to love?
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,The title says it all! Enjoy and get yourself ready for some big waves! Be careful of vendors who do not tell you about a beach chair use "cost".... they stuck it on our bill after we ordered some food.... not expensive - but annoying to have that happen... Take your snorkelling gear... :)
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,What a gorgeous still off-the-beaten-track carribean beach. Love the beauty lack of crowds gorgeous blue water and wonderful white sand.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,The beach was average size somewhat busy...yet appreciated. The true beauty is the fact that it backs onto tourist kiosks with shaded areas. You could purchase clothing sculptures foods etc.

g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Loved it  good food. lots to see and do or just lay in the sun on the beach. can do shopping also.Walk along the beach or just sit to have a drink and mingle with the people
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,We just wanted to walk down the beach but we asked by about 40 men if we needed beach chairs for the day. "Cheapy Cheapy" yea ok. The tide was really high and the waves would go all the way to the seawall so you'd need a chair. We left & went back to Cabarate.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Great fishing village. Good snorkeling nice beach. This is the launching point for the snorkeling and catamaran excursions. Nice protected port we saw lots of fish and recommend the Tip Top group for this activity.

g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Went to this beach for scuba diving - and I feel in love with this place it's beautiful! And the sealife is amazing! A lot of the coral is dead but you can see a lot of different kind of fish bring a banan then you experience the fish really close!
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,like glass bottom boat cheap entertainment. Dislike people constantly trying to sell you things. Liked "steady Eddie" who didn't push and gave free gifts for the ladies.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,We stopped here as part of our Catamaran tour. This is a provincial protected beach as their corals are considered national treasure. Beautiful corals and fish of all kinds. Would love to go back.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Landscape is lovely but merchants irritate a bit. Prices are too high in the shops and restaurants.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Lots of irritating vendors if you want to relax use your own resort beach. The beach itself though was really nice soft sand.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,This is a long but narrow beach with palmtrees and simple restaurants in the back. Nice coral reef for snorkeling. Nicer sand than in Playa dorada so if you live there a day trip here is recommended.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Clean beach and able to swim in the sea not rough waves nice shops near by locals very friendly and trust worthy will get you what ever you want if you cant see it straight away
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Vendors are pushy but just ignore them and smile. Some fun reefs to snorkle. Calm waters. Very pretty.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,the water is beautiful. Great for snorkelling. The locals can be somewhat pushy with their shops but they are very nice and mean no harm. Always a great day at Sosua.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,This beach is great to walk around on swim do tours shop and sit and have drinks! After the sun goes down go to the street area and enjoy a great selection of restaurants for dinner.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,a popular place withthe locals...tends to be pretty crowded good to be watchful with your belongings when on the beach....
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,It was kind of small no waves and a lot of random shops. Cabarete beach is definitely a better beach option.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Snorkeling in Sosua was beautiful.... I highly recommend it. The water is a little murky so make sure you bring a good quality underwate camera. Bring bread in water bottles the fish love it.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,While celebrating my milestone birthday vacation we were fortunate to attend The Jazz Festival on Sosua Beach & Cabarete. Beautiful beach great food great people another slice of paradise! Worth a second third and forth visit.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,The prositutes are taking over this town...really sad and not a place to bring your kids. The vendors are aggressive and relentless.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,It is a very nice beach but the business there need a little tidying up and painting. It detracts from the beauty and made us feel uncomfortable
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,great snorkling --sousa beach is beautiful  coral is wonderful to see  plus you can see how the locals live from the boat tour staff on the boat are fun  friendly

g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,The sales people at Sosua Beach are very pushy and have a hard time taking no for an answer. Beach was beautiful.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Just lie there and take in the rays great sandy beach and plenty of attractions near by. The only thing that can be a bit of a pain is the constant stream of people selling stuff but they have to make a living got some great ornaments home.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Food and drinks are a bit pricey but overall fun lots to do... Never buy ANYTHING from the souvenir shops they are junk. Been a native for 24 years and worked on the beach on summer as a teen I personally know this.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,sosua beach is beautifull excellent for snorkelling fish are out of this world and the market is good too this has to be the best beach in the north of dominicun republic by far.

g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,This beach is beautiful and was a lot more calm than Cabarete where our resort was located. We also ordered fresh fish and had it prepared for our lunch and we were served a fantastic meal by the locals!
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Not a bad beach but too much begging from the vendors. I understand they are very poor but everytime you turned around someone was trying to put a guilt trip on you.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,As long as you don't mind people trying to sell you stuff you will have a great time. All you have to say is no gracias.. and they will leave you alone.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,They see you & they see dollar signs. Just be firm and say "no!" Otherwise the beach is beautiful and clean.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Brilliant beach very clean and ancient buildings are a bliss. the beach is crystal clear calm waters and ideal for snorkling and scuba diving
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Snorkelling was fab just don't get back on the wrong boat like I did haha lovely crew who made our day enjoyable with jumping/diving competitions be careful tho they go all out to get you drunk...great fun
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,If you wanted to enjoy the beach you had to go out there between 6&7 AM so you're not disturbed by anyone selling stuff
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Had a great time at this beach. Excellent service great place to relax and enjoy vacation. Great Acommodations.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Sosua is a very beautiful beach. If you are walk further down the beach it is much more tranquil on that side. There is also a lot of activites from the just lounging eating drinking the banana glass bottom boats catamarans etc. There is something for everyone and it is all very affordable. I had a great time.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Well worth the drive from Gran Ventana Puerto Plata. About 30 minutes down the road. Bring peso for the food! It's very good.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Very family and swim friendly as the ocean is very calm here and the beach gently slopes out. There is always a nice breeze. This is also a great place to have lunch or a few drinks.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,day trip here and went scuba diving. Amazing beach and clear water went on a catamaran from Playa Dorada and had a remarkable day
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,looks gorgeous. we took a boat trip there to snorkel the reefs. you lucky peolple that are staying in that resort. the reef are amazing.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,We met our dive instructor here for dive and had to pay for parking..not a good start to the day. It's a bit run down and touristy - but nice enough to hang out for the day. Only bathrooms are 10 pesos but they are clean - only closed later in the evening so don't drink a bunch of Presidentes!
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,The beach was busy on the weekend but dead during the week. Sea Pro Divers were so professionial & showed us so many great dive sites...can't wait to go back!!
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,30 mins from Puerto Plata you'll find this popular cove. The beach is lined with palm trees and small restaurants. You can lie on the beach and enjoy a genuine pina colada for a few dollars or take a ride on the "banana" boat. Lots of restaurants and bars in town. Nice place to stay or visit
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Great beach warm people. Great food. Beautiful view. Watch for broken glass in the water though. Beach chairs are 3 $ a day. Well worth it as they bring you w.e you need.. Great prices on food and drinks too.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Really enjoyed this beach as I spent it snorkelling in the water from a catamarran. got a good video of my time there
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,We loved our excursion from Cofresi Palm Beach Resort and Spa. This was arranged by Wilson and the guys who took us out on the boat were really friendly helpful and safety conscious. We had a blast!
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,clean white sand amazing clear water..my b/f went scuba diving there and i stayed on the beach just amazing
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Booked a snorkeling trip on the Glass Bottom Boat out of Sosua. Crystal clear water. White sand. The absolute clearest water I've ever been in. High salt content makes it sparkle and makes you float so easily that snorkeling becomes no work at all. Loved the beach.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,This is a great beach to waste the day away on .....however a visit to it is not a waste of time
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,This beach was great. No waves and there are plenty of lounge chairs to sleep/ sit on. Many different places to go eat just beware there will be people asking you for money left and right JUST SAY NO or they will never leave you alone.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,beautiful beach quiet (in Nov)  had a great snorkling trip starting from this beach. ask for Carlos and his crew super friendly. very helpful for a wheelchair person.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,This beach was much better than the Cofresi beach. Water was calmer smaller waves and very very clean water; could see the bottom in 10 ft of water. Nice turquoise water This is a local beach with multiple small local stores/bars food places on the beach. Highly recommended to spend a day here especially for families with small children.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,in thought it was a beautiful beach and the flea market was fun...
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Great snorkelling and a very friendly dive school . it is only a short boat ride out to the reef lots of fish squid and coral to see
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,This beach town is dependent on tourist trade; lots of shops and dining places right on beach. Everyone is so relaxed!
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Sosua Public Beach has a great atmosphere. Lots of little shops and cafes along the beach. You can rent a beach chair and relax on the beach. It is a great place to take the family and spend the day
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,hardly any fish to see though for snorkeling but the water was nice and clear
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,This is an amazing beach the water is a nice blue and clear it's really beautiful. I highly recommend it.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,I always go to Leo banana's bar or caseta on the beach great place Beer is cold and the fish is great.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Take the catamaran cruise to Sousa it's incredible
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,The restaurants and bars in town are diverse and entertaining.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Beautiful beach.. Great for snorkeling you can see a lot of Tropician fishes. We only pay $35 for snorkeling. Miguel from lifestyle beach game us a great price.. It was amazing how beautiful the beach is. Make sure you have 20 Peso to use the bathroom..
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,stayed at the hotel on the beach and it was about 10 feet long until the public beach which went on forever but was never safe to go on to. The market on the beach however is huge and you can get some good deals.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Im not sure if there is more than one beach in Sosua but the one I went to was really great for swimming but have to pay for a beach chair.. did not like that part and the vendors bhind the beach at the shops are too pushy for me. Loved the water and the quiteness of the beach!
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,I loved sosua. We did a snorkel trip here and the fish are great to be around and very bold!
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Nice beach but way too crowded. Didn't like the constant interruption from the locals pushing their products or services or just asking for handouts.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Very nice and relaxing beach with good infra structure. Snorkelling is possible from the shore (you can also get to the small reef by boat). I recommend to buy some tangerines and roasted nuts (delicious).
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,There are a plenty of restaurants on the beach where you can have lunch and enjoy free sunbed thereafter. As everywhere in Dominican Republic local people tray to sell everything just ignore them
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Best place ive ever been in my entire life. I really enjoyed myself here. We had our own private server with chairs and loved every minute of it. This place is a must.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Lovely family friendly beach with crystal clear waters and lots of watersports. There are many bars and restaurants along the beachfront with a great choice of different food available
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,If your swimming and more than 75 feet from beach do not put your feet down without foot protection on. Your feet will be full of coral slivers!
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,If you're going for snorkeling prepare to be disappointed. There is not much sea life or corals.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,The beach is the best I have seen in Cuba Punta Cana Mexico and Peurto Plata. White sands rolling waves great for swimming.Also the shore is lined with little restaraunts and bars easily accessable to and from the beach itself.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,the tour guides were awesome...fun and skilled. Eddy 1 & 2 were funny.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,What a BEACH! With much nicer people than the Barcelo!
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Way better than the beach at our resort. Next time we'll stay in a hotel near to Sosua and not deal with the hassle and lack of customer service at the Cofresi Palm.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Stayed for a week very nice/clean beach Clear water . No space for ball games if that's what ur into Haggle for a deal on sunbeds usually u can get the umbrella for free It's not exactly relaxing as people try and sell u things even though u said no 10 mins ago
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,If you are into snorkeling you will love this place. We loved the Sosua Bay area also. Some of the most colorful fish I have seen.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Excellent snorkeling and beachside relaxation. Lots of restaurants/bars right behind the beach and the beach attendants will bring refreshments right to your chair.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,We traveled by taxi from out Iberostar hotel to Sosua Beach for half the day taxi driver dropped us off & we arranged a pick up point a few hours later. The beach was great to walk along & sun at lots of little hut eatery's & people selling you things.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,too many vendors always trying to sell you some thing
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Sosua Beach was stunning; it reminded me of a beach in europe. Take a cab and head over there it was just amazing next trip to DR i am staying in Sosua
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,great beach beautiful people amazing service! goood food got the drinks brought to us for low price!
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Quaint and beautiful beach. Snorkling and scuba and incredible for beginners; calm beautiful waters with lots to see! Great shops and restuarants along the beach. Great shopping and a fabulous day!
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,To many vendor trying to sell you a chair on the beach or merchandise.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,So many shops! The vendors can be pushy but there's lots of selection. Check out Big Mama's and tell her Tom/Shauna from Canada sent you! Swimming and snorkeling are great here too. Breathtakingly beautiful!
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,This beach has crystal clear water. a little over populated but still great. I consider it the best in the Puerto Plata area of Dominican Republic.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Make sure you step off the resort and check out the beach in Sosua. The sand was better water clearer and people were food was awesome. Do note that everyone will try and sell you everything.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,nice beach; lots of vendors -but friendly - didn't bother us too much
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,best reef to snorkel on this side of the island check out the nuvudu bar
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,The guys take care of you as soon as you get on the beach they bring you beach chairs and menus you order your food and drinks and they bring it to you. Water is nice and you can see an occasional fish swimming by you :)
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,A fun little trip with over a mile of market...the further u go down the market...the cheaper things get! Nice place to stop for a nice cold beer for sure! Lots of vendors but an adventure!!!!
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,We had lunch at the Mufongo King (probably spelled wrong) and had the BEST Mufongo ever. Tons of cracklings in a very tasty plantain/garlic/herb mix - and cheap. We could watch the intense beach scene from our table - kids running around prostitutes and their clients terrified tourists tons of dogs and an unending stream of talking between locals.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,After you have to swim through tsumani-sized waves to get to the boat that takes you to the dive boat ..... it was fine !!!
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,During the day the beach is very nice and lots to do on and off the beach. Evenings the beggers and ladies of the evening come out and one after another pester you. This was our only turn off.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,the best beach with brilliant warm turquoise water was not busy with tourists or locals - amazing to even just look at!!
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,The beach is beautiful and the people are friendly
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,I did my course with baracuda diving school and my first real diving experience was in the waters of Sosua beach very nice- I can not fault it!
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,seeing the Dominican people shopping pinapple drinks beach
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Still a beautiful beach in a pristine setting with the possibility to see living coral and tropical fish.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,The waters can get rough but on most days it's a wonderful clean place to relax and enjoy the sun. The walk to the public area is loaded with shops. A lot of the shops offer paintings of naked women.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,it's fun walking down amonst the market stalls the people are friendly if you just want to look but remember they want a sale so barter hard. walk down to Scandinavian bar and pay it a visit it's worth it!
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Beautiful beach.. just learn the word no! Someone is going to try to sell you something every chance the wind blows....
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,all vendors have the best...according to them....and will sell you all the tourist stuff you can carry
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Love sosua beach for its flea market jolly rogers (best fish and chips on the face of the earth) and the people
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,What a fabulous day out. FOod was great crew were fabulous and looked after everyone making sure you all had drinks. Snorkling was great too which they provided all the gear which was clean. Best part of the holiday
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Nice yellow sand and clear water however the was a lot of current when we were there. Even though there are a lot of people it does not seem busy or touristy but is very chilled out and realxing.
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Been to sosua many times!Sosoa beach and the market a mustfrendly people and great beer.Will recomend to anybody
g317146,d149676,February 8 2016,Sousua was wonderful. The town is quaint and full of charm. Little shops and resturants. The beach was beautiful with nice sand and a touch of class and lots of people watching. Go. You won't regret it.

g317146,d149676,March 13 2016,The beach has a mix of locals beach vendors tourists ex-pats etc. All exist in harmony on this stunningly beautiful beach.
g317146,d149676,March 13 2016,Such gorgeous view great water for swimming. For rockless water walk down further. We also did the banana boat from here was so much fun and a great way to see the coast.
g317146,d149676,March 13 2016,There are a lot of places to eat and you can take in the sun have a drink and swim in the ocean. The people are friendly and the drinks are good a must visit
g317146,d149676,March 13 2016,This is a lovely beach and there are loads of different barsrestaurants and shops. It's not your usual beach woth loads of hotels on.
g317146,d149676,March 13 2016,
g317146,d149676,March 13 2016,Nice place to have a feel of a dynamic mix of cultures nicely represented by the surrounding restaurants with their different themes. A perfect hangout for guys traveling together and looking for some fun; if accompanied by wife and kids Alicia Beach is more adequate.
g317146,d149676,March 13 2016,
g317146,d149676,March 13 2016,We had a private beach at out Resort but since this was a short walk we decided to check it out one afternoon. Lots of fun. Mostly locals lots of places to eat and drink - good water for swimming.
g317146,d149676,March 13 2016,Lots of vendors they need to make a living just keep on walking if your not interested in buying anything if you see something you like then start haggling the price by offering them 1/3 of the price! Also everything is negotiable souvenirs food chairs massages dont be shy and practice your haggling skills :)
g317146,d149676,March 13 2016,Loved the beaches in Sosua. The water is warm and you can even do some water activities here. Many things to do around town but just be careful with your car and belongings. We did not have any issues but its always good to be careful.

g317146,d149676,March 13 2016,
g317146,d149676,March 13 2016,This beach has many stores and restaurants and is very popular with the local residents. Excellent experience overall precisely because it is not designed for tourists. From the beach you can also find excellent food with a five minute walk into "downtown" Sosua. If your kids like Banana boats this is your spot.
g317146,d149676,March 13 2016,We visited this beach as part of an excursion and we thoroughly enjoyed relaxing on the beach. Water was slightly rough but in general a beautiful beach with a few shops surrounding it. You get the usual beach sellers but a polite "No" is enough.
g317146,d149676,March 13 2016,Great value for a beach vacation in the island of hispainola. A Lot to do and relax throughout the day.
g317146,d149676,March 13 2016,They have some very nice restaurants along the beach. I always found the water to be a bit rough. There are a lot water sports.
g317146,d149676,March 13 2016,
g317146,d149676,March 13 2016,
g317146,d149676,March 13 2016,Sosua Beach is the busiest beach in Sosua. It is filled with local shops restaurants and beach vendors. It is walking distance from the centre of downtown Sosua minutes from most hotels. It is a clean beach which also allows to assimilate with the locals. It is a must visit if you are staying in Sosua.
g317146,d149676,March 13 2016,
g317146,d149676,March 13 2016,Crystal-clear water golden sand beautiful view of Mount Isabel de Torres diving centers banana boats and glass bottom boats lots of shade fresh fish from small beach restaurants (COCO RICO recommended right in the middle of the beach also - the best entry into water). The best beach!!!
g317146,d149676,March 13 2016,
g317146,d149676,March 13 2016,So many better beaches around. This place is a bad place with tons of stalls selling their crap. Take out 80% of this it could be nice. Kinda trashy overall. Would bever visit again.
g317146,d149676,March 13 2016,The beach is sooo good warm and so clean and beautiful not here in November the red flag for people not to go in the beach was placed because is too strong but i still enjoyed it
g317146,d149676,March 13 2016,Not great for small children. Waves can be a bit big and beach drops off quickly. Water was very warm. Can be quite fun for adults who can swim.
g317146,d149676,March 13 2016,Busy bustling place.It is a huge bay nearly a mile long coconut palms come right down to a beautiful sandy beach in which all round the bay there interesting little shops the sea is usually very calm .
g317146,d149676,March 13 2016,This beach is the "snorkeling beach". Although I did not participate it doesn't offer a lot in the way of viewing right off the beach. An excursion (that will cost extra) takes you around the bend where I was told the snorkeling was great! Without the snorkeling the beach was superb!
g317146,d149676,March 13 2016,Sosua beach is so beautiful. The sea is clear blue and the sand is white. The sunbeds are like all others sunbeds in DR(awful) but who cares.
g317146,d149676,March 13 2016,Very nice place for having a drink watching people and having a swim There's always action going on.
g317146,d149676,March 13 2016,I stayed here one day with a local friend of mine. You dont have to pay for the sunbeds as long as you buy something from the respective bar/restaurant And you`re in The Dominican Republic its really cheap. Amazing sand clean and clear sea.
g488162,d2513634,February 24 2016,
g488162,d2513634,February 25 2016,The zoo itself seems fairly well run. I just get upset seeing all these animals in cages with little to do purely to titillate a few American tourists. If you have never been to any kind of animal Park perhaps you will find this interesting but for the rest of us it is neither pleasant or particularly impressive.

g488162,d2513634,February 17 2016,We didn't visit with a tour - we went by ourselves. We were given a bag full of carrot slices and food pellets. Not knowing what to do we wandered around the farm feeding the animals and having a good time.
g488162,d2513634,February 17 2016,
g488162,d2513634,February 17 2016,
g488162,d2513634,February 17 2016,The Animal Garden is great-- well worth the 10USD per person admission. We saw camels lamasemus snakes beautiful birds monkeys and many others. Included in the admission charge is a bag of food to feed the animals. Really glad we went there.

g488162,d2513634,February 17 2016,A.B. and Toto are the best tour guides on the island. This was a blast and I highly recommend it. Thanx for a great time today guys.

g488162,d2513634,February 17 2016,
g488162,d2513634,February 17 2016,Cute animals that you can feed an pet. We were told that they didn't have food for the monkey's so we went out to the store and bought peanuts so we could feed them. So much fun! Lots of different animals to see. Even some you don't see in the United States.
g488162,d2513634,February 17 2016,
g488162,d2513634,February 17 2016,When we heard that that our guide was a sixth grader we thought "oh great!" But then we met Quentin and he was awesome!
g488162,d2513634,February 17 2016,
g488162,d2513634,February 17 2016,I visited hear two years ago and was very impressed with the farm and the care the animals receive. It's a great sanctuary for animals that need care or that nobody wants. They are all beautiful creatures! I especially enjoyed the camels!
g488162,d2513634,February 17 2016,great for animal lovers love the charity and resucue the animals all over the caribbean. My kids can't wait to go back. Love the tour.
g488162,d2513634,February 17 2016,Looved the tour guide peeps (AB and TOTO) and the animals were absolutely awesome. This is like an animal shelter for all animals that are not wanted anymore by their owners. Amongst the animals there are Kangaroos Monkeys Goats and Camels. You also get to feed the animals.
g488162,d2513634,February 17 2016,We visited Philip's Animal Garden the morning of our first day (last week) as we were up early and it was a bit cloudy. We really enjoyed the tour especially the baby monkeys! Goats were a lot of fun too. Camels & adult monkeys not so much! Stay away!
g488162,d2513634,February 17 2016,Got a suprise tour of the animal garden when we signed up for a UTV tour with Around Aruba. This place is a hidden gem. Got a tour by Andrew who was a great guide. Wife loved the monkeys!
g488162,d2513634,February 17 2016,Had a good time touring Philip's Animal Garden. The animals looked well fed. I was happy to see that these animals were rescued. My only disappointment was hearing the guide say that they breed some of the animals.
g488162,d2513634,February 17 2016,
g488162,d2513634,February 17 2016,Too much animals in the cages and not enough shade. Although off course my 2 year old only sees the animals do had much fun. I thought could be run better.

g488162,d2513634,February 17 2016,We didn't expect much but were pleasantly surprised. Lots of variety quiet (except for the mule) and fun to feed. Great for the young and old.
g488162,d2513634,February 17 2016,Had the pleasure of seeing the farm and UTV tour with A.B. He was very informative and a wonderful tour guide. They do a wonderful job with the animals. A definite must see tour when in Aruba.
g488162,d2513634,February 17 2016,This an is amazing place! You get to feed and interact with the animals. My kids even got to hold some of them. Freddie our guide was fantastic! He was very knowledgeable and funny. Philip takes in injured or misplaced animals and is run by volunteers. It's must see especially if you have kids!
g488162,d2513634,February 17 2016,It was cute. My wife is an animal lover and she had a large time feeding the animals. It's great what they're doing there - animal rescue and all. It's basically a petting zoo.
g488162,d2513634,February 17 2016,
g488162,d2513634,February 17 2016,
g488162,d2513634,February 17 2016,This is one of the few attractions we had to pay for in Aruba but it was worth it. The staff are excellent and you get to contact many of the animals directly and the kids loved that. The baby goats were a riot. They also give you food so you can feed them along the way.

g488162,d2513634,February 17 2016,Highly recommend if you have kids or love animals. Our guide was Freddy and he was very thorough. The kids got to shake hands with a monkey hold turtles pet and feed many other animals. They have a great non=profit organization!. We had a great time! It was inexpensive and totally worth the taxi fare.
g488162,d2513634,February 17 2016,We did the UTV tour with AroundAruba and this was our first stop because this is where we picked up the vehicles. I liked see the adopted/rescued animals. Only thing I hated were the snakes esp. the anaconda. I hated hearing that the raise ducks to feed them. I know it's life but didn't need to know that! *lol*
g488162,d2513634,February 17 2016,
g488162,d2513634,February 17 2016,My first impression of the garden was that it was very clean. The staff is very knowledgeable and friendly and they show you how to feed the animals and provides the snacks. How they maintain to garden is very impressive....they take really good care of the animals that they rescued. I love the place and would highly recommend it.
g488162,d2513634,February 17 2016,Our kids had so much fun here! Watching the animals and interactively walking around was great for them. Besides that the ground look great and the animals are kept well. And for the entrance fee you don't have to skip this one!
g488162,d2513634,February 17 2016,Great place. Getting to hold the hedgehog was AWESOME! I want one!! The goats were greedy....lol. The camels were intimidating and the piglets were so freaking adorable.

g488162,d2513634,February 17 2016,
g488162,d2513634,February 17 2016,The kids loved feeding the 4-legged animals carrots and other food. There were many goats that fought for the food but it was great to see other animals like a camel and a kangaroo. They also enjoyed chasing a roaming peacock. Be sure to bring cash.
g488162,d2513634,February 17 2016,
g488162,d2513634,February 17 2016,this was a nice place to visit as it was part of our UTV tour of aruba. we weren't expecting it but it was nice to get some info about the island while we took the tour
g488162,d2513634,February 17 2016,
g488162,d2513634,February 17 2016,We found this place while in route to the Lighthouse. It's an animal rescue place. I didn't expect to find a Kangaroo. It's free but they do have a donation box.

g488162,d2513634,February 17 2016,We had an amazing time on the UTV tour! Philip actually picked us up but we didn't realize he owned the company and the rescue farm. AB was an amazing tour guide and our trip to Aruba would not have been complete without this tour. This is a MUST DO Tour!!!!
g488162,d2513634,February 17 2016,Beware of creatures nibbling on your clothes! :) A camel gave me a kiss. My family loved our visit here. The employees were helpful provided insight to the care and well being of the animals and all seemed very proud of their work. That's always a good sign for me.
g488162,d2513634,February 17 2016,We had a BLAST from start to finish! We were picked up on their very cool bus at our hotel. Our tour started with feeding the rescue animals and ended with touring some of Aruba's greatest landmarks on UTV's. Freddy was an amazing tour guide! This is a "must do" while in Aruba!
g488162,d2513634,February 17 2016,
g488162,d2513634,February 17 2016,Heartily recommend. Gillian was an amazing guide. We were lucky and had small group so able to answer all our questions. Spent plenty of time feeding and learning about all their animals. Definitely should be a must do when in Aruba
g488162,d2513634,February 17 2016,This was included in the utv tours with ab. in tours around Aruba a great experience but take the utv tour it was great the best

g488162,d2513634,February 17 2016,We got to see this as addition to our UTV tour and it was very nice. Ludwig our tour guide was excellent. They allow you to feed most of the animals.
g488162,d2513634,February 17 2016,Awesome! Don't miss! We went as a group of four adults and thoroughly enjoyed our visit! Dizzy was a magnificent tour guide and his genuine love of the rescued animals in his care is contagious! Philip's Animal Garden was an unexpected highlight of our trip to Aruba!!!!! Thank you!
g488162,d2513634,February 17 2016,loved it- the animals were awesome and a great cause. a must see if you go to Aruba. I had this as part of the tour that I was doing with Around Aruba with Ludwig Tromp
g488162,d2513634,February 17 2016,
g488162,d2513634,February 17 2016,What great kind work. Wonderful haven for all sorts of birds and animals. This was one of our favorite attractions on the island. Happy to pay the entrance fee for such a good cause!

g488162,d2513634,February 17 2016,What a great place. Thanks Philip your place is so wonderful. Love ahhhh the goat. Also the new spider monkey. Great add to the tour list when Aruba. Use All Around Aruba
g488162,d2513634,February 17 2016,So enjoyable we went twice! The animals will come right on up to you. You get a generous bag of food with your admission but we stayed so long we went back for more. Careful! The monkeys alpacas camels goats and horses know what's in the bag and they'll make a grab for it. Great adventure with or without kids.
g488162,d2513634,February 17 2016,A fun little place to take the family during the day. They ask for a donation which helps feed and take care of the animals. The staff is very friendly and its nice that they take you on a tour. I am obsessed with Monkeys so being able to feed them was huge highlight of the trip.
g488162,d2513634,February 17 2016,Philip is an incredible guy extremely nice and well informed about Aruba. His tour is the best on the whole island and the animal garden is the most amazing part. When vacationing in Aruba i would highly reccomend you do not miss out on this awesome opportunity!
g488162,d2513634,February 17 2016,We had a guided tour. The guide was very informative and friendly. It's great to see people care about the animals no one else wants or takes care of. The animals were sweet and lovable. It way amazing. Phillip you are doing a wonderful job.
g488162,d2513634,February 17 2016,Be sure to go early as it gets hot. We arrived when a field trip was here so it was chaotic but paid on our way out. Everyone that worked here was so nice. Very neat animals. My kids loved the monkeys the most! Feel free to message with any questions!
g488162,d2513634,February 17 2016,it was fun feeding the animals. the admission fee basically provides for the food supplied to feed the animals.
g488162,d2513634,February 17 2016,This place is amazing. The animals are friendly and energetic and really enjoy being hand fed! The employees were welcoming and went out of their way to make our experience unique. I highly recommend a visit here.
g488162,d2513634,February 16 2016,
g488162,d2513634,February 16 2016,We toured the rescue as part of our ATV tour and can't believe how lucky we were to have the two-fer! The animals are fabulous and the staff clearly loves them and what they do. Don't miss this!

g488162,d2513634,February 13 2016,We spotted a purple neck humming-bird (not part of the set up). Kids enjoyed feeding the animals. There are a lot of horses ponies donkeys macaws goats snakes camels kangaroos - essentially something worth visiting specially if you have kids.
g488162,d2513634,February 12 2016,
g488162,d2513634,February 11 2016,I wasn't expecting much at a zoo in Aruba. I was pleasantly surprised. So many different beautiful animals. Some were caged and some were loose. Gorgeous peacocks free roaming was quite a site. Offering nibbles to the animals was awesome and created wonderful photo opportunities. Fun for the whole family. I definitely recommend!
g488162,d2513634,February 11 2016,What a great place to visit and experience. It is a great cause that is run by a great man who truly has a passion for rescuing animals!
g488162,d2513634,February 10 2016,Yes go here. Its short but fulfilling feed the animals listen to their story. Monkeys camels emus horses goats donkeys reptiles and so much more. Plus its for a great cause!

g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,My daughter and I loved every second of the tour with AB. He was knowledgeable about the island and so patient and friendly. He swam with my daughter in the natural pool and helped her jump off the cliff. I highly recommend the tour of Aruba and i hope you're lucky enough to have AB as your guide.
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,The tour guide made this trip very nice and interactive! I loved getting to feed all of the animals with the food bag that you get as you enter the park. Be sure to request a guided tour! We tipped him because he did such a great job. The animals are very fun to pet and feed.

g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,This is a very nicely maintained property with some pines horses camels cows monkeys and lots of VERY adorable goats. It's technically free but you can purchase a small bag to feed the animals with for just $5. You can also make a donation to help them keep the sanctuary going. The animals are very gentle and sweet.

g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,I've gone to Aruba several times and my only regret is not taking the All Around Aruba Tour sooner! We saw such beautiful places and met some great people around the island and I would do it again in a heart beat! It was an amazing experience with our tour guide that I will never forget.
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,

g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,Our guide thru the animal gardens was an 11 year old kid named Quinten. He was awesome. So knowledgeable about the animals and so personable. He volunteers there every weekend. My husband and I were very impressed. The animals are cared for nicely. Need to work on spay and neutering though.
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,The animal garden was alot of fun. We have a guide and were able to feed and interact with the animals. Love those capuchin monkeys. Great fun!

g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,We started our UTV tour at Phillips Gardens and were very impressed with this Rescue zoo. AB shared a lot about the rescued animals of Aruba and the history of the island. We thoroughly enjoyed interacting with the animals feeding them and getting to know their history! A must visit on Aruba.

g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,We took our son there an he had a great time. He was able to interact with the kangaroos a bit. He had a really good time. It is nice to see that there is a place on the island that will take exotic animals in. It is worth going to.
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,These were all rescued animals from closed zoos or confiscated from poachers etc... Here they have their new forever home. Clean and large enclosures. We could feed them carrots and kibble too! Thanks for the information Ludwig!

g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,It was great to see Phillip's animal rescue project and to get to meet the animals up close and personal. They provide you with a bag of treats and the animals loved to eat from our hands. I have to say the monkeys were probably my favorite but I truly enjoyed all.
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,AB showed us around and introduced us to all the animals. We even got to play with the baby monkeys. The mission of Philip's Animal Garden is wonderful - it takes in abandoned animals and cares for them for the rest of their lives. A great place to visit and support!
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,Lots of different "rescued" animals ... Were lucky enough to have an educated volunteer "guide" ... For $10 "donation" you get bag of carrots and kibbles to enter & feed animals inside. Very close to high rise area.

g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,So nice to see the variety of animals saved by this group. We were able to feed a good number of different species and view many others.
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,Rambo did a fantastic job on our UTV tour! He made the whole trip very enjoyable and fun! Defiantly would do it again! The natural pool was the best part of the whole trip!

g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,Great place to visit they have many more animals than we thought and some we didn't know existed. Everyone learned a ton about them the native species and the island in general. Quinton is a fantastic guide very friendly and incredibly knowledgable. Highly recommend. Great for the whole family.
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,We love animals and we love to feed animals. Fun place to go and feed animals such as deer ewe goats alpacas horses pigs. Fun to watch monkeys and birds. Would spend maybe 1 hour there.

g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,Definitely go check this place out and have Quinton (a ~10 year old) guide you around! A ton of fun for kids and adults. The Garden is built around a local residence and is a home for rescued animals. All of the animals are treated very well.

g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,Well maintained and carefully thought out animal rescue. Self-sustainable on many levels ie they grow some of their own food. They exist strictly on donations and volunteers. What a wonderful concept. This a lovely farm and very hands on for visitors. Phillip and his guys are lovely lovely people.

g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,We were on an a UTV tour which started here. Great place and great people doing a wonderful thing for these animals. Drop by and take a look and have some fun feeding some of the animals.
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,Informative and for a good cause! We had a wonderful tour guide (I don't remember his name). Guests can feed and hold many of the animals. Kids will love.
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,We checked out Philip's Animal Garden this time around visiting Aruba. It was only $10 to get in and you get a large bag of food to feed the animals. You get a personal tour. All the animals were rescued and very mild. It was very clean and well maintained. Loved this place!

g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,We are repeat visitors to Philips since we are part time residents of Aruba with a 3 year old. The animals are so well taken care of and the staff is so knowledgeable and friendly. Our latest tour guide was Abie and he was entertaining and fun and was great with our little girl.

g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,All the animals were rescued when they were abandoned by their owners. A lot of different species including ostriches snakes and a mixed breed horse/donkey . We had a 14 yr old guide (sorry forgot his name) that was very informative and had a great sense of humor.
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,Beautiful layout saw animals that I have never seen before tour guide was fun knowledgeable and easy going. Learned a lot and had a great experience plus the feeding of the animals is fun. Highly recommended for family outing. Thank you Phillip's for rescuing the animals!

g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,Definitely worth seeing nice people and animals. A. B. was a nice tour guide. Get some fainting goats for next time :).
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,Very nicely run very good tour. Lots of animals. Lovely morning for the kids. Make sure u go early gets very hot.
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,This place was much larger than we'd expected. Our tour guide was great he had a story for every animal and was great at answering questions. We got to see all sorts of animals and even feed some of them. Great for couples kids and individuals. They could really charge more than $10 entry.
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,Had a nice time at the zoo. I'm an aninal lover and visit local zoos where ever I go. AB showed us around. He was very nice and shared a lot of information. They do need money to improve habitats and acquire more animals. Please go visit and leave a donation. Every little bit helps!
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,Highly recommend - many upclose encounters for kids and adults. Spend a few extra minutes near parrots - they talk and enjoy the company;-)
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,I come here every time I come to Aruba. I love the way the animals are taken care of. Also the tour guides are very nice and in formative. Just a great place to go see for a couple of hrs.
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,AB was our great guide - funny and knowledgeable. Phillip takes in illegally imported animals no questions asked as well as less exotic rescue animals. Lots of information chance to hand feed hoofed species including 2 cute camels. Well worth the drive and your support
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,First off...ask for AB the tour guide. Very educating experience. The animals are rescues. They are mostly friendly animals. You can feed them. Def. worth going and listening to what he says.
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,This is a little "zoo" type place that houses displaced animals of all types. The staff is very nice the animals are very social and happy this is a really fun excursion.
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,Don't expect a zoo expect an exotic children's zoo. Absolutely worth the trip if you enjoy interacting with animals. The entrance fee is extremely cheap (AFL 5.00/USD 3.00) and you will thoroughly enjoy the visit within two hours. You get a bag of food to feed the animals as well - always fun! As locals we will definitely go back.
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,AB was an awesome tour guide. He taught us a lot about the animals! It was a blast feeding all the different animals. My 5 & 4 yr old loved the experience. Skip the ostrich farm and donkey sanctuary and come here! You get it all! Just a tip: bring water on your tour. It is HOT!!!
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,This is a must see for all animal lovers and children! This was a great stop during our vacation in Aruba. Our children enjoyed a very educational tour to meet the wide variety of animals not only farm animals but exotic animals as well. Please come visit and support these animals as this is nonprofit organization.
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,We took our 3-year-old daughter with us here and were very happy. Not only was the guide engaging and knowledgeable we were encouraged to take our time afterwards to feed the animals etc. We visited after having seen the Ostrich Farm which was a big disappointment. Do not miss Philip's!

g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,What a pleasant surprise. had a wonderful tour by a guy who just loved the animals to bits and loved talking to us and them. You get a bag of food as part of the entrance fee and you feed the animals as well as hearing about them Great job guys as these are all rescued anilams

If you go don't forget to tip him ( we noticed most people didn't but his knowledge was worth an extra $5 to us) and donate to this great nonprofit.
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,This was an unexpectedly great part of our vacation. The kid who took us on our tour knew all of the animals by name and was very knowledgeable about the animals. We really enjoyed our time with him.

g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,Our kids (ages 7 and 9) loved this place. We all loved feeding the animals. Fed the ponies horses monkeys goats cows camels etc. It was a great break from just going to the beach and pool.
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,We enjoyed visiting the animal garden during our July 2014 visit to Aruba. The tour guide and animal food really made it perfect!!
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,If you are an animal lover you will injoy Philip's Animal Garden. This is a kids friendly place. For $10 you will gain entrance and a bag of feed to feed the animals. Kids will love this interaction up close and personal experience with animals. Goats donkeys horses camels wild cats monkeys ducks swans and more.
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,Spent several hours here got to feed the animals and had a wonderful guide who seemed to love the animals and shared a lot of information with us. The animals were mostly rescues. Wonderful cause and a fun place to visit while in Aruba! Highly recommended.

g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,If you like feeding donkeys horses and goats then you'll like this place. The have other animals - camels boa constrictors and a rather sad kangaroo who's mate died a few years ago. Apparently they are waiting for "Jack" to die before they get another pair. At $10 each the price is not bad.
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,DeAngelo the tour guide was EXCELLENT! I expected it to be more geared for the kids but my husband and I truly enjoyed it and learned a lot through the guided tour.
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,Near Alto Vista Chapel. $5 for children & $10 for adults which goes towards taking care of the animals. Dizi was our guide and he was great. Funny knowledgeable and superb with the children. Facility is unique - on the property of the owner. Very much worth the trip.
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,Philip's Animal Garden was amazing! I was truly inspired by this experience. Nicole was our guide and she was incredible...she took the time to give us 1-1 special attention and made it truly magical. This is a must see!!
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,We spent several hours here one afternoon with our 6 and 10 year olds. Our guide was good and the kids enjoyed feeding the animals and really interacting with the animals.

g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,When we first arrived we were a little unsure but this is definitely a must see. It's a Sanctuary for animals! Just by going you are supporting the welfare and lives of the animals. GREAT staff too. Tour guides are the best. Watch out for the Mule- he is a purse thief. :)
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,If you love animals taking a tour of this animal rescue farm is a must. You can feed them and interact with them. And by going you're helping maintain the facility. We've been coming to Aruba for 14 years and just found out about it. Highly recommend it.

g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,At first I was a little hesitant to visit the animal garden as I've been to a number of petting zoos. This one was different. Yes we got to pet and feed goats and horses but where else can you pet camels monkeys donkeys and even bulls? I truly enjoyed this place.

g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,My family and I had a great educational trip to Phillips Garden. I encourage everyone to go and visit. Your $10.00 will get you entrance plus food for the animals. Our tour guide was very helpful and passionate about her job. We loved the monkeys in the back cage.

g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,It's a lot of fun to be able to feed the animals directly from your hand. Watch out for the red Shetland pony he bites if you stand too close and don't give him food.
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,Kids loved it. We brought extra carrots with us the 3 times we went. Phillip cuts the carrots for you and the goats horses and camels become your best friends. Very neat place.

g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,This is a great little zoo especially for younger children. Admission is 10 dollars and that includes a large bag of food to feed the animals. There is a nice variety of animals to see from peacocks to kangaroos. Many of the animals you can pet. There is also an area with baby animals. A fun two hours.
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,What a great way to support their efforts by visiting. Lots of different animals. They even give you food to feed the animals as well
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,The was a fun stop in the beginning of our UTV tour with Around Aruba :) I held a baby goat and the dog was trying to bite its foot. It was soooo cute!
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,I love this place and he is doing such a good thing for these and all the animals of Aruba. This is a must see for all ages! It was great to see all the animals that were babies last year all grown-up this year.
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,We Recieved a guided tour by a gentleman that was very knowledgeable. The animals were well cared for and interesting to visit. Would go back again.

g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,Don't be afraid to spend your $ at the entrance of this farm. Well worth the time and money. The animals are well taken care of and the ground are beautiful and still a work in progress.
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,Great little spot to stop. We had so much fun feeding the animals as well as holding the little baby goat "buttercup". The monkeys were a blast and surprisingly a lot of different interesting animals. Nicole gave a very informative and interactive tour of the sanctuary. Would definitely recommend this to all animal lovers and decently priced for the cause.
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,The animal garden was great. Enjoyed seeing and feeding the animals. My 3 yr old daughter had the best time feeding the goats.

g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,We took a tour led by Dizzy. The place and tour both significantly exceeded our expectations. Took Three kids: 23 and 4 and each had a blast. More impressive than the tour was the mission of the Garden for animals in need. Highly recommended.
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,I found this place by coincidence. It's a beautiful and clean place and the animals are in pretty good condition; and you are able to feed the animals and get contact with them. It was a very nice finding.
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,We had a blast seeing all the exotic animals in this sanctuary as well as feeding some of them. We were amazed at the number and variety of animals from wild cats exotic birds snakes monkeys camels & llamas to domesticated farm animals to feed.
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,We never thought we would go to a "zoo" without our son but this place was special. They've rescued these animals and are providing them with a wonderful life. The pigmy goats were the best.
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,A fun time with friendly animals in a caring environment. Our tour guide was Dizzy and he was friendly and informative. Definitely worth checking out if you need a break from margaritas and tanning. And watch out for the monkey--he tried to steal my hat.

We parked paid the $10 per person and went in to the run down petting zoo/rescue/animal hospital. They did have some exotic animals to see and if you are an animal lover it was a fun inexpensive diversion from the beach for 1-2 hours

g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,Philip has been saving animals for a while and his "animal garden" has been open for 2 yrs. It is nice that he is rescuing animals and giving them a nice place to roam. This is a very family friendly stop.

g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,We took our toddler here and she loved it. There are many different kinds of animals and they give you food to carrots and other snacks to feed the animals. Beautiful views also and a chance to see the interior of Aruba. It would be fun for just adults too if you like animals. $10 each.
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,Philip's Animal Garden is an animal lovers dream come true! This man has helped so many animals and has opened his doors to show his passion and dreams. It's a must see in Aruba!!!

g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,even if you are not a fan of zoos or animals (like me)-- you can't help but be marveled by this place. philip the owner knows the history of all the animals in his care...and there are ALOT! So worth the trip.

g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,While cruising the island we stopped at the animal garden. We had a great time with the animals and our friendly and fun guide 'Jlo' (Deangelo). The animals are very well taken care of. Just don't give away all the carrots at the beginning of the tour there're lot's of animals you can feed. Great project and fun!
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,A nice couple of hours in this private zoo is great!Nice zoo on a beautiful property! A repeat visit with my daughter is a thing to do on Aruba.
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,This is an "animal rescue" farm that apparently has gradually grown into a full-blown zoo. For a fee of $10 US you get a personal guide to take you around the entire premises and tell you the history of each and every animal. Well worth it; one of the best values in Aruba!
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,I had a great time visiting the animal garden! Not only are the people working their a pleasure to speak with and very knowledgeable. The property is beautiful and all of the animals are well cared for. The work they are doing over there is purely inspirational! Go check it out!

g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,You will see some animals which are taken care of. If you (pretend to ..) live already for a longer time on Aruba you will pay local instead of tourist (double) tarif. Combine this visit with a sightseeing of the small church nearbye.
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,We had a great tour. Worth the money. I'm glad they are taking care of these animals. They are clearly doing the best they can out of passion for the animals.
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,My wife and I had a great experience today visiting the Animal Garden. It's more of an animal sanctuary than a zoo and it's great how the staff and the owner take care of these animals. Highly recommended!! It's also really cheap ($10) and you can give donations to help them take care of the animals.
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,It was like a mini-zoo. Not fancy at all but there were a variety of animals and all for a good cause.. It's off the beaten path a bit but I feel it is worth a visit!!
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,This place is awesome! Phillip is doing God's work taking care of abandoned and abused animals. This was the least expensive thing we did on the island and my kid's loved!

g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,This is not a zoo but an animal sanctuary. Philip the owner of the Garden rescued animals from closed zoo and from people who decided not to keep. Bubu the manager on duty gave us a guided tour and shared with us stories of each animal. A great place to spend 1-2 hours.
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,Fun place to visit. Enjoyed the different animals. Best bargain on the Island! I especially liked the horses and the peacock.

g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,Had 10 of us plus an 8 month old. Toured the animal garden where there are rescued animals followed by an UTV tour of the coast. Also took a jeep with my granddaughter. Toto was our tour guide. He picked us up at the Hyatt. Outstanding day. Highly recommended. Thanks Toto.

g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,This was a nice way to see the animals habitat in Aruba. The grounds were well kept. However reading the previous reviews I personally expected more. I guess it's just a matter of personal taste.
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,Philip's Animal Garden was a big hit with our kids (8-12 yrs). They loved feeding carrots and kibble to the goats donkeys camels and bunnies. My favorite were the baby capuchin monkeys who just love holding your hands and licking the fingers! This is not a zoo; it's a rescue center so please support their efforts by visiting them.
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,Very pretty entrance. Great value. Our 5 year old is already asking to go back. Thanks again Philip!

g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,We have been to Aruba annually since 2005. We learned about Philips from trip advisor. When we got there with our 6 and 3 year old we had no cash. Philip let us all in and Geno gave us a great tour. Our children loved it! The check is on its way! The Plechers
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,Great family outing what nice people both Phillip and Gino! My son who is seven had a blast! Our camera battery died and they were so nice they took a special picture and sent it to our email! I wish them continued success!

Enjoyable for all ages. Just watch out for the hairless bunnies ! Will be sure to visit Phillip with each visit to Aruba.
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,Philip rescues a wide variety of animals. Great cause and enjoyable family experience! We enjoyed every minute of our stay. We will return there on our next trip to Aruba!

g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,I visited the farm last week with my husband and 11 month old son. We had a personal tour by Philip and were very impressed. We were able to feed the various animals who were very friendly. One of the goats jumped into my son's stroller about 20 times- it was very cute. We had so much fun!

g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,It's so cool how many animals they have rescued and take care of! Loved it. There are many animals that you wouldn't expect to see there but they take excellent care of all of them.
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,Did three tours.. ATV UTV and jeep tour. Amazing knowledge of Aruba. Fantastic evening petting zoo. Visited cave natural bridge natural pool.. Everything was top shelve!!

g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,This place has taken in all the animals from the two defunct zoos that were in Aruba. You get a bag of food to feed the animals when you go in. The grounds are well kept and the animals well cared for. I would have liked to see some of the water changed but overall everything was great!
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,Cool place the people are very nice and they give you a bag of feed for the animals which is fun probably even better if you are with kids
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,Signed up for the ATV tour and visited the Animal Garden before setting out. The animals were very interesting and fun to feed. A.B. Was our tour leader and did an excellent job. The scenery was spectacular and the Natural Pool is a great finishing spot.

g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,We really enjoyed this place! For $10 each you get admission and a bag of treats to feed the animals. We enjoyed seeing all the animals and especially feeding the kangaroocamels goats bunnies and turtles. Worth the visit.
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,Nice little side trip during our stay in Aruba. Small enough that it didn't take up an entire afternoon. Monkeys were the best! Just a few minutes from our hotel.
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,This animal rescue center on Aruba is the best we have seen ever and you can clearly see and witness that the animals are definitely being taken care of.
g488162,d2513634,February 9 2016,We really enjoyed our quick tour of the animal garden as part of our UTV tour with Around Aruba Tours. This was a nice was of starting out our trip and it was good to know that the profits from the UTV tour were going to help this animal rescue.
g666621,d4053401,March 7 2016,
g666621,d4053401,March 7 2016,It's great for relaxing in the rental chairs or walking along the shore. Just beautiful to see white sand crystal blue waters..picture perfect
g666621,d4053401,March 7 2016,Beautiful clean fabulous sandy beach. Not overcrowded. No people selling. Our hotel was on the beach and most people if they want parasols go around the pool or under the palm trees so not jammed packed with people. Lovely to walk along this beach at eight in the morning when the temperature is around 28 degrees.
g666621,d4053401,March 6 2016,This has got to be the best 1000' stretch of beach in Barbados. The sand is white and is the texture of flour. The waves can be big on one side and swimmable on the other. The water is turquoise and warm and very clean and seethrough.
g666621,d4053401,March 4 2016,This beach is not a perfect swimming beach. The sea can be quite rough and the current very strong but it is more useable than you would first think. Because of the strong wind water sports can be limited and snorkelling is poor. However it is a beautiful beach with a nice cooling breeze and fabulous white sand.
g666621,d4053401,March 3 2016,
g666621,d4053401,March 2 2016,Take a walk and relax at this beach. It is marvelous! smooth sand and just a little surf. It is close to the Gap and has good access to restaurants and markets too
g666621,d4053401,March 2 2016,Fantastic beach - quiet and really surfy at the same time. Not a high rollers place but terrific little strip all the same. Love breakfast at happy days - they be great people as well as cooks. Good jerk available on the strip
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,We have spent many hours lounging in the sand and "bobbing" in the clear waters of Dover Beach. If there is a paradise on earth then it is on Dover Beach.
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,Lovely sandy beach with huge waves at times. Sea great for swimming in. Busy but peaceful . Loved it very much
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,It might lack the wow factor of some world class beaches but if you want to spend several days at the beach this is the beach to go to. It has soft sand and gentle surf which puts it ahead of the neighboring beaches at the gap. It's clean. There's plenty of casual food concessions with great local flavor.
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,This beach is so gorgeous great surf white sand and beautiful sunsets. There are food shacks within easy access and a guy selling fresh coconuts. Try out Pure Ocean for a cocktail at their beachfront bar.
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,Busy beach with lots going on such as jet skis catamarans inflatables chairs and sun beds for hire. Shacks serving food and drink. Not the best beach in Barbados.
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,The beach is exquiste. Very long with beautiful white powdery sand. Large hotels alongside small quant ones and an open area where you get to hang with the locals for a great time drink food and history. Truly magical.
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,Everyone is very friendly the beach is beautiful and very clean and the water is amazing. Great for jet-skiing kayaking and wind surfing all of which I believe can be rented at the beach lessons included...also both the sunrise and the sunset views are amazing!! Even if it rains when you are there - stay! - it won't last long!
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,just moments away from our hotel had all the amenities near by watersport facilities near and access to neach chairs at all times only having to pay a daily rate. could leave stuff by chair and your things would still be there after being left for long period of time.
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,A great beach! Very few people on it and feels like your own private beach! Waves were rather big when we were there (Dec). The sunrise is spectacular!
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,What a loverly beach with white sand and sea so blue you would not belive ! Only down side is the area at the back of the beach its becoming so what run down and needs a face lift a real shame.
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,Very nice beach sun beds on the beach have seen better days A few bars along the way Timeout hotel is just across the road
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,Stayed across the road from here. Very lovely beach. Reasonably busy but the beach guys always sorted sunbeds and umbrella out. Cost about 40 Barbados dollars for four beds and two umbrellas so about £3.30 each per person. Other beaches on the west coast will be double. Close to bars to drinks and snacks close by.
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,Wonderful beach loved the waves the young men providing the umbrellas and loungers were polite and helpful
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,Just a great beach to swim and relax or to walk along the waterfront. Soft white sand and a place for refreshments at the entrance to the beach.
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,We have been at this beach on vacations for the past 35 years.(1980) Always friendly staff at the snack bars and drinks are easily available There are folks that you can rent a sun chair from if you wish and the prices are reasonable
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,We actually got to see 2 turtles swimming in the sea. We watched them for ages on the last morning. Absolutely amazing.
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,A great beach but unfortunately the red flags were flying all week so we couldn't swim at all. Great for sunbathing but the nearest swimming was further up the coast.
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,This is a lovely beach on the South Coast which is rarely busy (except for the odd couple of hours once a week when cruise ship travellers visit) and even then there is still plenty of room to relax or hire a jet-ski
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,Situated on the west (caribbean side) of the island at the end of the St Lawrence Gap Dover Beach is great for families. Plenty of space amenities soft sand no rocks or pebbles and is also lifeguard attended (and attentive they are too). A good and worthwhile day out location
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,We have been to dover beach 12 times now and in the past apart from April this year with the sea weed which was awful  when we came in November the beach was very dirty needs a lot of attention around the little bar area this I thought let it down first impression not that good.
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,nice beach not pestered by vendors and well looked after in terms of cleanliness. sun loungers were in good condition and not overly expensive - plenty of food and drink available nearby
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,Very relaxing getaway for week. Will visit this location again. Room are adequately sized air conditioning worked well was close to beach across the street.
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,I walked over to Dover Beach from where I was staying. Mostly hotel guests inhabited the sands. It's a long beach so there's plenty of space. There are shops and food shops steps away. The beach is gorgeous as is every other beach on the west of the island.
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,White sand blue sea. My wife does not usually enjoy the beach but she loved this one. Attentive guys will sort you out with loungers umbrellas. Shacks are great for food and drinks.
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,Too windy and seas too rough to swim Better go Carlisle bay as truly beautiful seas and calm and not windy Carlisle bay nicest sea I've ever seen
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,Beautiful sandy beach protected by corals. Many places to have snack and a drink so you do not have to leave the beach. Weekly chair rentals are a good deal. Pay cash and the boys will remember you.
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,The beach is free but the best deal is to pay the lifeguards $10. They set up beach umbrellas and lounge chairs and watch your things when you are in the water. They are also quick to spot when someone might be having trouble. There are several food stands and souvenir stalls adjacent.
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,The colours of waters fishing boats that pass crabs and trilobites on the rocks an early morning fisherman great beach glass fabulous sunsets a sense of quiet and peace pure white sand and when the water is calm bathing in the sea makes this ideal for a restful holiday.
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,Probably the most commercial beach on the south coast lots of local vendors sunbeds water sports etc lovely swimming beach with a small shelf on entry nice powder white sand lots of places to eat would recommend Daddy's on the front nearest the road.
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,This beach has lots to offer. There are food and drinks vendors and the price of a parasol and chairs is very reasonable. The water is beautiful. The only downside is that the sand here is not as soft as elsewhere due to many small shells and the beach itself is not very large so can feel a little crowded.
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,The beaches are a golden white sand with a turquoise sea some parts are for surfing lifeguards are on duty. The beaches are all child friendly some wate sports are availale. All the beaches are public.
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,Lovely beach and the guys with the sun beds not too in your face if you say no thanks you do not get any hassle but take water and plenty of sun lotion. current can be a bit strong and can have big waves but is not too deep.. great!
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,Activities to choose from plenty of places to eat drink and socialise. safe environment. Nice gift shops with friendly staff.
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,When with  (wasnt me ) . Captained by big Ron . By far the best day of my holiday. Big Ron runs a tight ship . Crew couldnt do enough for u. Plenty of food and drink. Food was excellent ! Tunes were excellent and very appropriate ....here comes the sun ! ....
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,Safe swimming with water sports available. Loungers and umbrellas available affordable. Hatch-lings in November on beach.Easy access to food and drinks.
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,Best time to enjoy the beach is in the morning. We came at 8:00 which was perfect not too hot and the beach was vacant (bar the runners). We spent some time learning how to fish with some fishermen which was a great way to meet the locals. There are no private beaches in Barbados so enjoy!
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,Spent 10 days in the Dover beach area. Beautiful area lovely beach warm water and fantastic people. What surprised myself and my girlfriend so much about Barbados was how friendly every1 was! Very welcoming. Lots of places to eat and drink. Will definitely return someday
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,You can see turtle hatchings frequently and earlier in season laying them. Extensive lovely Caribbean beach watersports available at one end quiet at other end.
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,One of the islands most beautiful beaches. South facing means the sun rises on the left of the beach and sets on the right. Stunning every day.
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,We stayed on this beach during our stay- was beautiful however now suitable for swimming due to rough waters and the red flag was up for the entire duration of our stay.
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,Dover beach is just beatiful. The sea is clear and warm and lovely to swim in. Lots of places for food and drink. People are lovely....just visit ots soooo nice!!
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,Considering while we were there the island was having a terrible time with seaweed it was a great beach.
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,Been going there for 30 years. Lots of changes. Some good. Some not. Lots of shade or plenty of sun. You chose.. Good place to swim. Nice selection of food huts.
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,This has to be my favourite beach on Barbados. Others are more open but this one from the point of a non-swimmer is lovely to splash around on rock free sand in clear waters and just relax! Nice and close to facilities to get a drink this is suitable for all and very safe. Perfect.
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,The beach is beautiful the restaurants are good but be aware of the locals. To many little boys think there are big gangsters. And way too much sex-tourism. If you travel alone as a women don't think they would do anything for free with no other agenda in mind.
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,Similar to the South of France the beaches are relatively short and fall into the sea fairly steeply. The winds blow quite strong there so it helps you keep cool but you must remember to reapply sun tan lotion as can be deceiving. Lots of water sports opportunities and not too far away from beaches where baby turtles are born.
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,The water is very nice. Grab a lounge and relax in the sun. Barbados beaches are the best. Nothing bad to say.
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,Good Beach. Friendly people Great Location for family and friends to plan vacation spot. Close to Capital. Hottest chill spot in Barbados
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,Good beach close to St Lawrence gap you can rent sun beds etc there are some beach bars which are used by the locals who get quite drunk they try to sell you stuff if you say no thanks they leave you alone and not much hassle all in all a nice beach to relax or swim in the sea
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,We don't have tons of beach experience but we had a great time on this sunny patch of white sand. Sand goes out a long way. Good waves to splash around in. Nice and quiet in October... and places to rent chairs surfboards etc.
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,Lovely beach. Although this was a public beach it was used mainly by the guests at the hotel. We couldn't swim in the sea as it was too choppy.
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,Shallow sandy beach where 2 sunbeds and parasol will cost you 20 Barbados dollars (just short of £7). Food and drink available at this location.
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,Beach is OK but the waves and under current were strong. So many nicer beaches close by. Take the Regge but and go to The Boatyard. The beach there is amazing!
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,Lovely soft sand to walk on with watersports and beach bars available head to Sea Fans at Infinity for lunchtime rum punch happy hour. Lovely views and would recommend this beach to all
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,Waters murky and pretty strong current. Go to Rockley or better yet the Boatyard. Cold beers and good food from the beach shacks.
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,Picturesque beach but can be a bit rough at times and I have indeed seen surfers here from time to time. Lovely if you want to catch some sun have a great view or sit under a shady tree and just relax. Water sports equipment can be rented along this stretch such as jet ski hobbie cats etc.
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,Beautiful Beach With Turtles! Water warm & idylic. Whilst your in the water enjoying a bathe don't be surprised to see a turtle or two swimming by. Don't go paying through the nose for some of the trips "Swimming with turtles" when you can swim for free. Early morning is good. This beach isn't over busy either. Stunning!
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,Nice beach but like other South Coast beaches attracts the Seaweed. Also slightly rough. For a stunning beach with azure tranquil waters - I suggest Carlisle Bay which is a 10 minute drive from here.
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,Enjoyed the hotel it was clean and safe nice lookout over the beach Staff was excellent. Location was great for nightlife and places to eat
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,Had a holiday on this beach 6years ago and had a day there this year it's fabulous good for swimming and not too big.
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,Stayed at Sunbay Hotel and I was unimpressed with the hotel and the beach area with had seaweed and an awful smell. Didn't get in the water around this area. I went to Brown's beach.
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,Surf can be a tad rough and high at times but the beach is beautiful with lovely white sand plenty of shade and nearby bars and restaurants
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,would not really recommend this beach for children don't find the environment safe for children to go swimming
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,
g666621,d4053401,March 1 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 27 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 27 2016,Absolute paradise! Beautiful white sand and clear blue sea just like the pictures! Lovely beach bar and lots of other lovely bars nearby highly recommend xx
g666621,d4053401,February 27 2016,Use access via alley next to Walkers World quieter part of beach. Parasols and loungers available...at no cost when swimming at 4.00pm.
g666621,d4053401,February 27 2016,A wide clean beach occasionally a little breezy but shallow. Good for turtle spotting. Wind surfing & jet skis for hire but not a nuisance.
g666621,d4053401,February 26 2016,Everything was soooooo Beautiful! TAKE ME BACK. From the clear blue skies to blue beach chairs to blue waters I was totally left blutified......I will truly be back the next time I go to Barbados
g666621,d4053401,February 26 2016,Most people prefer to Bob up and down with the waves. Strong current in places. Most prefer to roast on loungers well sprayed with lotions.
g666621,d4053401,February 25 2016,Condo was located on Dover beach and it is the biggest and nicest beach I saw on the island.. Highly recommend a day trip or entire trip on this beach!
g666621,d4053401,February 25 2016,Nice beach with chairs to rent and plenty of places to eat but too crowded for me. Rather set at a bar and watch the waves.
g666621,d4053401,February 25 2016,The reason I say this is because the seas are very rough here and the white sand is gritty. Best beach is Caryle.
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,Stayed on Dover beach at southern palms A real nice beach white sand quite wide although water a bit rough plent of people swimming beach shacks for cheap eats and drinks
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,Great beach with a couple of rum shacks for cold rum punch or Banks Beer. Wonderful sand calm waters and free sun beds and parasols. Close to St Lawrence Gap and all the fun that gives
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,A great beach and lovely calm sea. Better served than most by a lovely bar that has happy hour and numerous activities like sailing etc. Speak nice to one of the local beach dudes and they'll take you into Bridge town!
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,Dover beach is about 1/2 mile down from The "Gap"....enjoyed a freshly prepared flying-fish BBQ wings (both a Barbados staple) with several cold Banks beer.
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,one of the best beaches on the island and if you ask the chair attendants they will drag your chair up to the southern palms were you can have a snake and a drink while you sunbathe under a coconut tree. regards picktech
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,Lovely sandy beach that stretches a fair way and has a number of reasonable cafes and restaurants to visit when the heat becomes too much!
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,not the best beach around bit windy would travel further to carlile beach. this was the beach of sandals was nice but there are better beaches.
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,dover beach is a very clean beach. but 19-25 MPH eastern winds made leisurely swimming difficult. however there were many folks who were in the water but the surf was too much for me. was told by locals that the high winds was unusual.
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,We stayed at Turtle Beach Hotel and there was seaweed in the sea that made it dirty and mucky also the neighbouring Hotel was digging up the sea bed and made the whole beach smelly
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,Food was great and it was cheap and cheerful a great way to lime on a Saturday's afternoon. Not normally my kind of thing but I did enjoy watching the tourist and local mingle.
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,Dover beach is a beautiful long beach with white sands and calm waters excellent for swimming. Great location for restaurants and bars.
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,Beautiful blue sea! What more could you ask for? There are sun loungers you can rent for the day or just sit on the sand if you wish. There are plenty of stall/bars for lunch or drinks.
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,The waves are a lot rougher thanon the West Coast. It is where the atlantic meets the caribbean. There is also a lot of see weed on some parts of it.
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,Another awesome beach in Barbados which is a must do very lovely water and nice beach to relax on with the nicest people. they is a number on take out and sit down restaurants as you walk in to the beach also its right by St. Lawrence gap. Good place to get a tan!!!
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,Perfect for swimming and sunbathing. Wasn't affected by the influx of seaweed. Worth the visit and a must see.
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,Nice clean beach in August 2015 was free of the seaweed problem affecting large parts of the east and south coasts Great little beach side kiosk serving snacks Chill out and visit this great beach
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,We have visited here on a number of occasions when we are in Barbados. This beach is quiet and clean. The water a beautiful blue! There are cafés restaurants bars and hotels along the beach
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,Paradise Cool clear waters golden sand fantastic views Quiet no hassle from sellers beach bars not a rip off and the local shops very welcoming
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,The water is great not too rough. The tide comes in at about 4. Not too much seaweed when I was there.
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,this beach is one truly breathtaking paradise you shouldn't miss it is perfect in every way so clean and crystal blue you can swim for miles and still stand up in it its truly what you would dream about
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,I have been visiting this beach on off for the last 10 years. Over the last 5 winters I have spent entire days relaxing here swimming and soaking up the sun. Its a wonderful beach its very clean relatively quiet in comparison to other places I have been and the scenery is spectacular.
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,dover beach is lovely we stayed at the bourgainvillia hotel which is right on the beach it was perfect
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,Lots of seaweed affecting Barbados at the moment and Dover is no exception but still one of my favourite areas on the south coast of the island with plenty of eating and sleeping options suiting all pockets.
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,Great morning stroll and sunset stroll. We walked from the small beach outside Ocean 2 across to Dover beach around 9am. Water was clamer so my 7 yr old can enjoy the ocean.
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,Very nice beach which was not too busy small cafes nearby for drinks etc and larger ones for meals.
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,I love St Lawrence Gap. You get a feel for the island with lots of local eats and entertainment as well as the beautiful Dover Beach
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,Loved this beach - look out for Charlie's watersports and beach club - lovely man! - take a rest at Johnny Cools beach bar for a Banks beer and lovely food
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,Lovely beach with shade from numerous palm trees with plenty of activities including snorkelling sailing and surfing. Beach is patrolled and is safe to swim with clear water close to several hotels and condos. Turtles nest here and are protected.
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,Had a great day at the beach. Stopped by Anne's (lil food shack) and had delicious food and wonderful company! Then off to the St Lawrence gap for some music dancing karaoke etc. So much fun!
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,Dover beach is clean peaceful home-like comfortably festive friendly and safe. I love this beach. No reason to go to any other while on the island.....but I do ;-)
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,Waves can get pretty big sand is clean beach can get pretty busy if you like a lot of privacy this is not the beach for you
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,Local building work in form of jetty being built. Not sure if connected to hotel. Did not bother us. White sands a busy sea that you can swim in. Good for the sporty person amongst you
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,Nice clean beach. Chairs and umbrellas available to rent for reasonable price. Water was a little rough but not overpowering. Drinks and food available
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,A lovely beach with good swimming though the sea could be quite rough some days with some excellent waves. There are lunch shacks near the beach.
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,Lovely golden beach a stones through from our hotel Time Out not a large beach and quite for our time of year we stayed.
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,Great sandy beach. It is shallow quite far out and soft white sand. We had lots of fun body surfing in the waves. You can rent beach loungers for $2.50 US. Great little places to grab a bite to eat.
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,we liked everything people were great there was nothing you could want for very friendly and met great other turists there also.
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,we like this beach; there's a nice restaurant there (forgotten name but looking on to the far left) that has good food and plays jazz music. good atmosphere at this beach. parking is limited though
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,Great beach very pretty and didn't get very busy. Swimming in the sea was great fun. You can even get a foot massage while you sun bathe.
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,i love dover beach cos its totally chilled theres lots of little shops and bars and food stalls close by
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,Loved the Sandals resort but was not happy with the beaches. And June is their rainy season and the shopping in town was closed on Sunday. We rented a car which was fun and we really enjoyed tour the island.
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,The seaweed in the south of barbados has turned the ocean brown and the beaches covered with rotting seaweed. The ocean is not safe to swim in
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,Great beach for the whole family or party groups. Lifeguard on duty. Water sports available some shopping and food & beverage all close.
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,The place to go...everything is right there! You can walk forever! And eat!! Can not wait to go back as soon as possible. Did not know anything about Barbados until this trip and completely enjoyed out time spent there. Great culture sights people and food!
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,Apart from the touts selling you everything.. This is a lovely beach with great amenities. Infinity On The Beach Bar serve great Rum Punch for happy hour 12-1pm and 5-6pm and the staff are fun and friendly.. A great beach for the whole family and couples alike
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,best beach i have seen in barbados sand is great not.much seaweed usual guys trying to sell but not much in way of hassle
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,We love this beach this is our 4th trip to Barbados and we always stay in the Gap Dover beach is a great beach and the chair rentals are very reasonable. Ask for Kenny he is the best and will give you a great deal.
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,it is a long clean white beach just like paradise it has hotels and restaurants on it..loungers for hire. close to all amenities
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,There was just a lot of seaweed everywhere this season but this part of the beach was semi seaweed free. I reccomend beaches in the west coast if traveling this summer.
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,The beach is a public beach however where Oceans Two is located it sits in a small cove not always accessible by the public making it a quiet beach. Always being cleaned by the pool attendants.
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,It was just an ok holiday not worth the money you pay beach was small could not go into the sea red flag flying all the time Lots of sea weed
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,Because it's located on the southwest side of the island it's very windy so it's good for boogie boarding and surfing and Barry's Surf school is always there to offer surf classes
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,White sand like soft powder - perfect exactly as I imagined the Caribbean to be! Sadly a few red flag days when we were there but it didn't spoil the walks along the shallows :)
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,Very nice beach with lots of activities. You can easily rent chairs from people and what's best is that you aren't solicited to purchase stuff all day.
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,Dover Beach is the prettiest beach white sand calm water and if your lucky you will see baby turtles hatch and make their way to the sea its a beautiful area of Barbados
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,small sun beds and umbrellas available. Great lunch cafe playing jazz. Fine soft sand and a life guard. Flags make it clear where to swim.
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,We had the pleasure of staying in a condo right on the beach. The first 3 days were fabulous sunny and relaxing while my daughter played and swam. However for the past 2 days there has been a vast amount of seaweed in the water and washed up on the beach. Very disappointing!
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,I loved it because the sea is quite turbulent and great for body boarding. My partner loved it less because you really can't swim in it. Slightly on the small side.
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,After a day of seeing the perimeter of the island we stopped at Dover beach on the way back to The Crane for a picnic. Got beach chairs for $5 BD each now that is a deal. Enjoyed the calm quiet atmosphere on a perfect Sunday afternoon. There were place to purchase food and drink. I would recommend.
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,Nice to sit and watch the waves crashing down unfortunately too rough for any of our arty to venture in which is a shame as we live snorkelling.
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,Very disappointed with the beach here.... But if your a surfer then you may like it. Didn't look or feel like a typical Caribbean beach
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,Beautiful Warm water blue color lots of things to see in the water Great location Easy parking Didn't dislike anything. Beautiful beach
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,Pristine white sand with that beautiful aquamarine ocean color. Plenty of nightlife and eats nearby too.
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,sitting on dover beach was amazing relaxing listening to the waves and reading our books . only one day you could get into the sea for a swim due to rough waves. when the red flag flies you can not get in.
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,The beach is very clean and quiet. You can walk quite a way along it. The hotel has its own private area of the beach with sunbeds and sun shades. Pure white sand with palm trees along the edge.
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,Great location and friendly people. The water was little choppy. Our hotel was locate directly on Dover Beach in St. Lawrence Gap. We stayed at Infinity On The Beach.
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,Beautiful beach  clean a bit rocky in places excellent crashing waves to jump over or body board on.
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,Great place for watersports. Beautiful blue waves nice sand. A rather short beach so not really much for beach-walkers. The lifeguard when on duty is a bit too conservative for our tastes. We were told to exit the water a few times when it didn't even approach the surf we are regularly in at home.
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,Dover Beach lived up to its reputation as one of the best beaches on Barbados. A pure sandy beach warm water and gently sloping. There are plenty of little bars for food and drink plus sun loungers and shades are easily available.
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,Very cool beach with nice calm waters compared to where our hotel was located. Carlisle Bay is a bigger beach and a bit nicer with calmer waters but considering Dove Beach was just a 5 minute walk from our hotel we enjoyed it.
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,The sea and sand is absolutely perfect - I normally enjoy neither due to temperature and coarseness - here they're both ideal and I really enjoyed a continuous six hours in and out of the sea. Local people so courteous helpful and friendly and not intrusive in any way.
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,I really like the location of this Hotel in relation to Dover Beach. The staff is very friendly and accommodating.
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,Beautiful white sands however sea very rough. Good sea for watersports as long as not red flagged!
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,The sea was rough one day and insisted I go down to meet the bottom of the ocean floor to then be released to enjoy the breezy air above. Be careful and enjoy this wonderful beach.
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,A bit rocky in some parts enjoyed watching the baby turtles making their way down to the sea. We enjoyed just lying on a deck chair watching some artists painting the view and couple of weddings on the beach
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 24 2016,Not an area we visited after dark but when exploring during the day the area seemed pleasant.The shops were full of lovely presents for home and essentials for your holiday with lovely friendly people.
g666621,d4053401,February 23 2016,One of the beautiful beaches of Barbados! White sand transparent water easy to swimm a lttle surfing on one side clean good service of the beach boys.
g666621,d4053401,February 23 2016,Lively and lovely beach plenty of room for everyone whether playing football volleyball or just sunbathing. Nearby there are huts that serve drinks and snacks at a good price($10for 4 bottles of banks). I believe there is a washroom nearby too. Jet skis are also available.
g666621,d4053401,February 23 2016,I love this beach. Most say it's too touristy I disagree. It's full of fun & life! Great views & lots to do. Friendly locals & lots of little cafe's surrounding it. A must do :)
g666621,d4053401,February 22 2016,Just a paradise. Go there 6 AM and enjoy the paradise the smells the cool atmosphere ... It's just great.
g666621,d4053401,February 19 2016,Dover Beach at least in front of Sandals Barbados is quite rough because it is located on the Atlantic side of the island. Water activities are limited.
g666621,d4053401,February 18 2016,A beautiful position and great food had a lovely night there with friends and some red stuff. Try and book the tables nearest the sea on the top level.
g666621,d4053401,February 17 2016,We spent a day at this beach and loved it. The beach is protected in places by a break wall which makes for great swimming. There are a number of hotels located on the beach. We had a couple of drinks at the Lantern's bar and loved it. Now a must stop. we will be back.
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,The water was the right temperature it was okay for a lovers walk under the moon. the surrounding was great
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,Nice and easy I say you could visit throughout the day for a drink walk or even a swim. Open to the public with private locations. As I said before nice and easy.
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,well looked after safe and not too busy great for swimming. Plenty of sun loungers reasonable prices and attendants not pushy ut very friendly and helpfull
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,Due to the weather in the North of USA over winter the effect on sea tides and currents is to bring Sargasso Seaweed from north of Bermuda down the east coast of the Caribbean leaving a blood red sea along the shore which is not appealing. When the winds dropped the waters were somewhat clearer.
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,The new Sandals resort is destroying the beach. This beach was the most beautiful in Barbados but Sandals have added water break walls that are messing with the natural flow of the ocean and the sand. We can no longer enjoy our walk from the Dover House to Bouganvillia
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,The sea is a little rough but still lovely .we had a ground floor room and if I was to go again I would try to get the same room so handy for everything . The staff are so helpful nothing I's to much for them to do for you
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,Great beach with food and drink vendors close by. We paid 20 BDS for 2 sunbeds and umbrella. Beach clean and not rough on days we were there. Not really bothered by vendors if you politely say no
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,good bars nightlife and shops great beaches. Close to bus stops so travelling around is easy. The area is clean and safe great friendly locals. Love it here.
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,Brilliant resort lots of bars music restaurants not far from Bridgetown  always taxis available ..or the reggae reggae bus will get you about (1 dollar)
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,A walk;a stroll;a jog;a quiet moment of reflection you can find it all on Dover Beach...Barbados is gifted with many beautiful beaches and this one is in the top ten
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,Dover beach has always been one of the best and cleanest beaches in the area and nothing has changed !! Saw turtles this time as well.
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,It was a five minute walk from my hotel. Great view of the ocean. Soft sand and clear blue water. I had a pleasant time.
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,beaches are awesome diving going and the boats meeting some nice bajans .but the men in the gap they suck always have something sell u and if u dont buy your the worst tourist
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,The beach was very clean and well kept. Overall and allowed for a nice nap in the sunshine on the lounge chair. However being on the Atlantic Ocean side of the island the water was a bit rough and not your typical Carribean sea calm water.
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,The beach is lovely but unfortunately when we were there the water was rough and there was lots and lots of seaweed rolling in all the time. The guys cleaning up the seaweed should have been given a medal as they worked so hard to keep the beach clean.
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,Lovely little place if you want peace and quiet nothing much to do so its a sun with shade in places so take a book or your iPod and the day will pass blissfully we loved this place it's a must to vist
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,Great beach  plenty of sunbeds jet skis bodyboarding and surfing we saw a large turtle come right on to the beach and lay her eggs in the sand. Places to book trips to go snorkelling and swim with turtles or just a lazy day sailing in a catamaran.
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,Great little beach you can hire 2 beds and a parasol for $10. Ask for a guy called Kenny and he'll sort you out. There is also a couple of stalls to purchase snacks and drinks as well as a beach restaurant. They also clean the seaweed during the day leaving a lovely sandy beach.
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,Charles is a pleasure to work with - has most toys you could want to rent. Fun waves on the beach out front. I would rent from him again.
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,I like the tranquil feel of the surroundings here very peaceful and pretty. Would defo recommend that you go there is you are visiting the country
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,Although the beach is small it is perfectly formed. Lots to do if you are a water sports fan. We just love to walk and watch the world go by. Peacefully set on a narrow stretch but we love it here.
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,Plenty of water sports available on the beach Sandy from Southern Palms is the man. Just a slight seaweed problem this year but its just nature.

g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,Beach is nice but small compared to what I am used to living near Pensacola Beach which is annually reviewed as one of the most beautiful beaches in America. The sand is packed more than I like and the beach is not very wide. Also companies have a unique boundary marking system with large rocks along the beach
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,Loved the soft sand and clear blue sea. Waves perfect for body boarding kept the boys entertained... one day of seaweed invasion (which was quickly removed by JCBs)
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,A nice beach overall but the only snag was that it was too short being restricted further access on each side by rocks.
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,the waves was the BEST!! had such a great time. Very clean water was blue and perfect. Sun was everywhere but there are palm trees where you can hide under them for some shade.
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,No words! My true favorite beach in Barbados. The sands the water the turtle everything is amazing. Nice service on the beach.
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,First class hotel truly all inclusive with excellent service The umbrellas and sunbeds were pressure points but hopefully the hotel will address the dawn patrol issues to get one in the right place.
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,I love the Sea and this is one beach where I rather look at it than try it! Rarely is the water calm enough for me but absolutely wonderful to watch and listen!
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,One of the longer beach areas in Barbados so there are a larger number of people along this area. Easy public access the usual 1 or 2 locals selling wares and asking if you want to use a lounger. Along the southwest coast so waves were still in play but not as large as at Crane or Maxwell Beaches.
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,This is a clean safe beach with no rocks. Loved it. Tried a few others but none matched up to this beach.
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,Dover Beach in the gap is a lovely area with plenty of restaurants and bars. The beach is incredible and it is a lovely place to go for an evening stroll!
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,Imagine yourself on a sun drenched beach with the warm waves lapping onto the soft white sand and the breeze waving the palm trees - this is it!!
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,Just lacked the wow factor. Lack of clean toilet and changing facilities. Just an average beach. Water was rough because oh strong winds but was clear and clean.
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,we stayed next door at Oceans 2 and the beach on our resort was quieter ( fewer people) and a better temperature. Dover beach was so crowded and although a little calmer  I much preferred our beach resort.
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,Bit breezy but plenty of shade from the swaying palms. Always staff on hand to bring drinks and water sports if required.
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,The beach is large with a variety of sandy bottom bathing options from the east end "geriatric" section to surfing and body surfing in the central and western ends.
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,Disliked that everyone seems to come to this beach..lol..but it's good that's why the came. Loved the location and the restaurants or shacks around it
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,One could run into the sea without worrying about any rocks. Beach umbrella and 2 sun loungers were only about USD 10/day. The smaller snack bars near the Gap road were better value than hotel beach bar (except for 5pm Happy Hour). Try the Chicken or Veggie Roti. Very filling !
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,The quality of the beach was great. Food areas could have been better but it did not spoil the enjoyment of the time there.
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,One of the most beautiful beaches I have been on soft sand we played it the warm waters like children
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,Have stayed on Dover Beach for several years. Beautiful water. Kenny (near Sapphire Condos) will set you up with a beach chair & umbrella at a reasonable price. Three laps from one end to the other gives you a mile of exercise.
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,Relaxing bit choppy but just beautiful. A nice romantic beach to walk along and quite secluded from the busy roads and people. Great sun sets here and lovley surroundings.
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,Flights by Virgin and Sandals accommodation first class. All inclusive (no exclusions) and such a high quality of service and dining options.
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,I visited here is 2013 but it won't let me select that option. It was amazing! Brilliant views and very clean
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,Great beach with nice surf and great places to eat right beside. Love this beach! There is nice surf to the left over the reef or right side of the beach.
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,Total Paradise white sands and torquoise seas what more could you ask for would defo recommend it.
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,You have to pay for an old beach chair and umbrella. You need to stay in designated aria in the water because there was only one life guard and we all needed to stay infront of him...
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,Cleanest beach we have ever seen - there was always plenty of room for us to lounge - definitely recommend going at the beginning of September
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,Gorgeous white sand clear blue waters and some nice little beach bars. A gorgeous spot to soak up the sun!
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,Wonderful beaches and great food. I would love to come back to this place. The RIO was a wonderful place to stay.
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,Spent a day or two at this beach :) Lovely for swimming waves aren't as high as others I visited when on this island. We did the banana boat and the jet-ski which was AMAZING! Approached by some vendors but think they realised we weren't interested so they got on their way without hassling us too much
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,Dover is in the middle of the gap. Too busy for my taste. But if has bars and kiosks around if you like all that. Water is calm which is kid friendly.
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,Nice beach with medium waves. Lots of action on the beach... chairs for sale resorts restaurants. We visited once but preferred other beaches on the island that were either calmer (west coast) or more stunning (Crane Bay).
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,We stayed around the corner at Ocean 2 but waded around the corner to swim on this beach lovely sandy beach with a few waves.
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,fantastic ocean for calm swimming kenny who works the beach beds is lovely providing us with sun loungers cushions and even fetching drinks for us. nice local food and bars within a stroll. very relaxing
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,Much calmer than the Sandals and about a 10 minute walk to it. The locals on the beach were very nice and we wern't bothered by people selling things at all.
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,Quiet although publc. No vendors. Couple of other properties share the beach. Sea ofter wavy. Good for surfing
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,The beach is lovely a bit windy the sea a bit choppy not good for swimming unless your a strong swimmer
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,

g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,This beach is beautiful! The water is clean and blue. I totally enjoyed being here and I will return.
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,Perfect beach probably the best I've been to & there are some eating huts nearby where they cook fresh fish daily
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,This Beach was GORGEOUS!!! My favorite location in the St. Lawrence Gap. A must see!! Crystal clear water local cuisine and drinks within walking distance and no struggle to find beach chairs!
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,Great beach when travelling with family or friends. Lots of space and more importantly beautiful white sand and clear blue water. Lots of food stands nearby and a surf shack if your up for some action!
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,Accessability close to main bus route & walking distance to many bars & restraunts. Everybody friendly & greet as you walk along.
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,One of the best stretches of sand on Barbados? Nothing here to dislike. We did notice a fair amount of seaweed this year versus other years.
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,Beautiful sandy beach with great food nearby and room to walk. Several restaurant choices and beach chair rentals available.
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,Spent a few days in Barbados and visited Dover Beach daily. The waves at times are quite high which makes for fun and sometimes a good work out. The turtles are seen around 4:00pm daily. Lots of chair rental guys available snacks are also available on site so you don't have to leave for meals. A must see.
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,lots of chair and umbrella rentals- fair deals. Watersports including surf lessons. Several restaurants on site and nearby. Shopping close and the Gap is close by.
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,grocery store but beware for a bag of coffee and i bad of Fritos Scoops $38 US. Safe area but not late night take a taxi.
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,Large wide beach white sand with turquoise waters with medium size waves which are good for boogie boarding. Fab sunsets. We stayed at Southern palms which is a very good hotel and holds centre stage to enjoy this great location.
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,lovely place clean water and white sand a paradise. Helpful and polite beach stuff. We stay for 2 weeks and when we did not come to the beach were asking if everything was fiine and why we were absent.
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,The lovely blue Caribbean sea combined with silky white soft sand makes Dover beach and ideal location for a holiday. There are hotels apartment and restaurants all nearby and if you will definitely chill out here. Plenty of sunbeds at a reasonable price to be found on the beach.
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,Dover Beach is a total delight. There is just enough going on to keep you people watching all day but it never seems to be overcrowded or too noisy. Beautiful for that early morning walk endless swims and soft sands. Watching the sun go down here is truly wonderful.
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,Fab beach friendly guys working here Lots of places to eat & drink Always life guards present The sea can get a little rough
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,Lovely Beach. Felt a lot safer than other beaches as there are just hotels backing onto it. Other beaches have a main road behind them which means you sometimes get dodgy characters in and out. Free sunbeds available for Rostrevor guests
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,4beds and a brolly worked out €14.00 which I think was good as the beach was great and there were a couple of bars selling local food too. The sea is very shallow so great for families but can become a little rough so beware.
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,Few days where red flags were out so waves were strong but life guards were patrolling the beach during these times. No sharp drop off so easy to walk in to sea just get your timing right so waves don't knock you off balance.
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,Just as you imagined -pure white sand and crystal clear sea.Easy walking distance of the Gap and lots going on. Try eating local food served from the back of a van very tasty and cheap.
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,beautiful beach - turqouis blue sea quite big waves at times - lots of sun loungers and umbrellas for hire - beach bar and cafes
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 16 2016,Great beach very safe and fun. Get chairs from Kenny or Charles and enjoy the beautiful water. Food and drinks at the kiosks are fantastic. All the locals friendly and ready to provide any help. Don't forget to spend an evening in a casual unique environment food is way better than you might expect. Sunday evening karaoke is a blast.
g666621,d4053401,February 15 2016,We toured them all this one is clearly the best. Great sand water sports waves for body surfing clean and pleasant. Great nearby food options as well and not as pretentious as the west coast beaches
g666621,d4053401,February 14 2016,The water is gorgeous color but not as nice as some beaches on the west side. The waves are also a bit stronger which is beautiful but not as good for swimming and children although it's completely safe
g666621,d4053401,February 13 2016,Beach next to our hotel never too crowded and chairs and umbrellas available good swimming see turtles if you are lucky
g666621,d4053401,February 11 2016,loved dover beach soft white sand warm sea good beach bar people watching (which is a must) lounger and umbrella service great and not too expensive all in all an ideal way to sunbathe and spend days
g666621,d4053401,February 10 2016,Fine sand and rolling waves boogie board and wind surfing available. Nice beach for walking and relaxing with family
g666621,d4053401,February 9 2016,Stayed at Sandals Barbados and after reading the reviews before we arrived I was really worried. I needn't have been the beach might not be as good as those on the west coast but was beautiful white sand and a great breeze for the tan.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Love Dover Beach in The St. Lawrence Gap. Soft white sand turquoise water . Perfect. Bars on the beach close by. Can rent chairs and umbrellas if you wish
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,lovely beach lots of water sports and bars great place for holiday. Very safe place to swim and lots of turtles around
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Pleasant beach with white sands wide sand strip and large shaded areas in the right and left corners. Depending on tide you can ride some waves (east side).
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Nothing to dislike it is a fantastic place to be love the people restaurants are good have not got a bad word to say
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,The beach is lovely. The sea can be a little rough but it's beautiful to look at and even if you don't want to swim a paddle is always possible.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Loved this beach. Did lots of people watching. Waves great! Beach lovely and clean. Chairs and shade for sale for $20.00 Barbados.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,This is the beach we always spent the most time at growing up. Still as amazing today as it was when I was young. I visited with my 10 year old daughter and she loved it.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Although its what you have always dreamed of when you actually lie on this beach its very annoying when guys that sell coconuts and girls that sell jewls come up to you. maybe im just nervous but it did spoil it a little bit.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Nicely positioned not too busy so spacious you are not on top of other people having plenty of space. It was kept clean and tidy by the hotel staff The sea was rather rough so swimming was not recommended the red flag was on show most of our stay. The sea was turquoise and just amazing to look at.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Sun and parasols good swimming daddy's burger bar nearby great for a snack lunch four bottles of banks beer only 10 BSD
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,so beautiful picturesque and worth going back too I loved the people who worked on the beach they were very kind and warm spirited and if you rent an umbrella/chair from Kenny and his team they are amazing!!
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,We stayed at the Infinity on the Beach and this beach was outside our hotel. Chairs are included if you stay there and for $5 an umbrella can be rented. Umbrellas are a must since both sun and rain storms pop up through the day.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Laid back friendly place. Some good places to eat and a few small shops. I especially liked Charles water-sports/surf hire right on beach: the left-hand side of the beach is nice for surfing (small reefbreak)  and I have some excellent surf lessons from Chris (based at Charles watersports).
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,The beach is beautiful but some of the vendors stop you and try to rip you off. Just be careful and keep your wits about you
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Soft sand little or no rocks. Fairly shallow and wade out quite a way. Warm clear water. Spend most of my time on this beach.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,

g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Amazing beach with the infamous 'Mr Delicious' food van serving the island's best fish cutters. Glorious sands and pine trees that offer some welcoming shade.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,This is my idea of Paradise. White sands turquoise sea and palm trees. The beach was virtually empty and so clean most people stayed in the hotel grounds. Soooo beautiful.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Fantastic beach one of the best on the island. The sand is so fine there is NO ROCKS OR STONES on the beach or in the water. Lots of cafe/ shacks for snacks. Take a towel the guys on the beach will set up a lounger & an umbrella for $5 ( US ) a person.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Great beach! Very suitable for kids as the water is not deep and has very little waves. Also ther eis lifeguards on duty. Beach chairs and umbrellas can be rented for a small fee. Restaurant located right on the beach. Picture perfect setting.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,This is a lovely beach with jet skis and other water sports. They have food outlets with the usual burgers chicken and rice which is tasty. Make sure to pay the right person when using the sunbeds.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,While it does become busy by early-afternoon the beach is idyllic. This is what Caribbean beaches should look like. Track down Dover Beach - you will not be disappointed.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Beatiful clean. Terrific waves on occasion. Beautiful sunsets. There are even trees that provide much needed shade
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Lovely busy beach. Beds and umberals for two $20 BBD. Sporting activities - wind surfing. Body boards. Banana boats. Jet ski. Nice local huts with local bajin crusine at cheap prices.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,We went all over the island to discover what are the beaches like only to discover the nicest beach was right on our doorstep: fabulous water sand sunset turtles!
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,My ultimate image of what a caribbean beach should be like - white sands clear waters palm trees... lots of hotels offering cocktails and food about...
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Dover beach is everything you would expect on a Caribbean Island. Long and wide with soft white sand and Palm trees littered along the beach.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,We spend our last morning at Dover watching the sun rise; it was beautiful. At that time of day we have the beach to ourselves with the exception of one person lounging on the hotel deck and a professional photographer. At that time of day the waves come up pretty far on the beach.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Restaurants and bars and the friendly beach boys. Toilet facilities available. Good sun loungers and parasols available for rent.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Boogies board heaven without being dragged back into the ocean...the beach is not overly crowded with people so you can enjoy a. It of privacy
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Dover Beach right in the St Lawrence Gap. Lots of beach chairs/loungers with umbrellas to rent. Watersports and hotel bars on the beach. Busy but fun. All white sand and no rocks in the water. Worth a visit.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Great beach - very relaxing with attractions like wind surfing or body boarding. You don't get harassed by sellers much and it isn't too noisy either.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,My sister-in-law got married staying out here and the ceremony took place with Dover Beach as the backdrop and we had photos on the beach. Just beautiful
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Beautiful sandy beach the sea is crystal clear but be ware the waves are quite strong knocked me over a couple of times & I am quite a strong swimmer
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Love this fantastic beach - Dover and Rockley must rate as some of the best on the island - no hassle from vendors just relaxing!
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Nice to wander around and to get to look at everything. Good variety of accomodation and shops. Close by and easy to get to on foot
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Have spent several visits to this idyllic beach stunning sand amazing clear water just a must place to visit
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Location good as close to the bars and restaurants of St Lawrence gap Sea rough and stoney beach not as fine as other places on the island
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Our hotel was right on Dover Beach so it was very convenient. The water was comfortable. Not too many vendors offering us their services-- though we were offered a random foot massage. The sunset was absolutely beautiful. Nice beaches are bountiful in Barbados. Though I must say Brownes Beach is MUCH nicer.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,visited the beach lots whilst here in Barbados and have really enjoyed it every time beds and umbrellas reasonable price too
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Lovely beach with plenty of sunbeds and local bars and food. Only a few minutes walk from our hotel friendly locals and reasonably priced food very close to your sunbed.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Long beautiful and if you're lucky you can get some surf. A lot of little bars and restaurants  so after watching the sunset you can have a drink or a bite.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Lovely friendly beach clean with nice bistro type bar. Sun beds can be negotiated so don't accept first price. We were a party of 6 adults and got looked after by Chris he was friendly and thoughtful and I would highly recommend him for your loungers.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Clean warm water idyllic crystal blue water and white soft sand beach. Not too crowded. Turtle hatchlings! Bar and toilet facilities nearby. (Bar much appreciated when it decided to torrential rain out of the blue! Great fresh fruit daiquiris!).

g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Beautiful white sandy beach with plenty of loungers and umbrellas close to various bars and eateries.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Seas a bit choppy but like a hot tub but still safe to swim the highlight for me was to be swimming with in feet of Turtles
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Beautiful beach sand surf. $10/day for umbrella and two lounge chairs. I stayed 'next door' at Ocean Two Resort which was a fabulous resort but it's beach had too much coral for swimming. Otherwise perfect.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Loved the beach beware of the helpful men who ask to take your order for food and dont come back! They didnt take any money of us but left us hungry for two hours. We later realised they had given us a very expensive menu so it left in our favour
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Beautiful water and plenty of water activities. Beautiful people and very safe. Go early to find parking.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,I love it here! I stayed at the Sapphire Beach Condos. I highly recommend this location if you want the feeling of "living on the ocean" for a week!
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,This beach is beautiful. Not too busy clear blue water and plenty of baby turtles at night to see during the season.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Great beach for wandering bathing and relaxing. Don't be put off by the Aloe Vera plant sellers. Just don't use it in Sun.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Good mix of tourists and locals and amenities and water sports keep it bustling but with quiet spots to relax
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,theres nothing I find to dislike hotel brilliant and great value for money lovely pool beach over the road what more coukld you ask for
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Great beach close to the Gap and Kenny looking after your belongings superbly. Great sandy beach and half-decent waves.

g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Quiet (I was there in October) but very beautiful. Eventhough is close to good bars/restaurants there were sea turtles and fishes in the ocean.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Staying at St Lawrence and Dover Beach is right opposite hotel . Beautiful clean beach . Plenty of sun beds to hire ( off Lenny ) 10bdd for 2 beds and an umbrella . Lots of little snack bars to have lunch or drink in . Water is clear and lifeguards on site .
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,

g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Loved to swim with the locals. They made you feel at home. Excellent hospitality clear water food and drinks. I would love to go again.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Nice & clean-lots of seaweed brought in off the Caribbean sea but this was removed regularly.Never crowded.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Great beach for a nice swim however there are rocks and a coral beach. The waves aren't big so it's a nice beach.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Nice beach without lots of people at the resort we stayed at. Did have some waves breaking but nothing too bad. It was easy to get past the break and enjoy the water.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Brilliant beautiful beach do a deal with Kenny get a discount and your sunbed will wave at you in the morning!
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Liked the ease of access from our hotel and the closeness to food outlets in the day. Also jetskis available everyday for good rates. There's a few beach hustlers about but just say no thank you and they're fine.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,A good little beach with lots of beach facilities and bars close by. Got to go and see graham Hall Swamp.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Sweet beach to chill on. Can get quite crowded in the high season but that's expected in the Caribbean. Learn how to surf or jetski among other activities available. Hop skip and a jump into the gap where there are lots of small shops and restaurants
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Fab beach best ever lovely clean white sands and clear blue sea. South Palme hotel one of the best places for a drink on the beach made everyone welcome.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,It's just like I imagined a paradise beach to be like. With white sand and crystal clear blue waters. It's clean and a great place to spend the day relaxing in the sun and cooling off in the sea.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,A public beach but a large expanse of sand. Beware of the dangerous trees they are marked but are poisonous if it rains. Turtles are often seen along this stretch of beach.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,We loved the beach at Turtle Beach which adjoins Dover. Small and between Maxwell & Dover. Always active seas.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Picture postcard beach soft sand & warm sea. Reasonable rate for hiring sunbeds. Clean close to beach huts and snack bars. All offering good value for money.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,

g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,This beach was lovely clean sunbeds and umberellas to hire at very cheap price we saw many baby turtles hatching and running to the sea. Water lovely and warm no hassle just beautiful.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,What more can I say. You have to be there to see just how beautiful this island is. The people are so friendly you feel like one happy big family. We have stayed at the Turtle Beach hotel. Truly amazing.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,I remember this beach being a frenzy of activity only 2 years ago but I found the small shops quite empty this time and there were not a lot of goods on display. Although fairly clean it seemed to lack the atmosphere that it is noted for.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Clear white sand and a spectacular beach view. There is a variety of water sport activities to experience. The locals are very easy going and if you want to learn how to surf ask for Richard at the beach front. Explore hidden adventures such as exploring the nearby caves.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Beautiful white wide sandy beach with friendly locals & rum punch. Shops bars and place to eat. Easy to get to and very clean.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,This beach stinks of rotten eggs especially after a rough sea that happen quite often in this part of Barbados (Atlantic)
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Walked into St. Lawrence Gap along the ocean from the Barbados Beach Club. Cute tourist area with beautiful beaches but mainly restaurants cater to the evening crowd. Tourist type shops selling souvenirs. Found a nice bar Café Sol to enjoy a wonderful Margarita. An area to visit once!
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Great beach with character that is lacking from other beaches along the island. Good for families and couples.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Just enjoying the surf jumping waves and there swimming next to us is a big ole sea turtle and then a few minutes later two more showed up. It was great.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Large clean beach with lots of loungers and people. I would prefer the quieter more secluded beach. Shops and bars close by.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Absolutely beautiful beach. Some big waves and a calmer area for swimming. White sand and an aqua sea!
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Loved this beach and watching the turtles swim was just fab  always clean and never too busy and near such a lot of bars and restaurants.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,One of the best if not the best beaches in Barbados. Water is turquoise and fairly calm. Great place for sunset pictures as well.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Great Beach clean and safe. It is at the east end of St Lawrence Gap. There are pletnty of place to stay great restaurants lots of night life. There are grocery stores for English Breakfast. I like the steak special for lunch with extra grilled onions
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Love the view the food and beach staff...especially Kenny (he rents out beach chairs and umbrellas)
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,safe to swim - sometimes very calm and sometimes big waves for jumping/boogie boarding a bit seaweedy but it was cleared up as much as possible. Could watch turtles coming up for air in the evening.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,This beach is perfect wonderful soft sand magnificent blue sea. You can catch a bus here really cheaply if you are not staying near.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,A bit rough and rocky but then I'm from Bermuda so I'm a bit spoiled. Pros ... they provide chairs and umbrellas for a fee.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Daiquiris on the beach hot sun blue waters...Jet skies and other activities available. Walking distance from hotel and restaurants.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,The waves were big but the sea was nice and I enjoyed every swim. Salty Salty Salty to say the least however I enjoyed every swim.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,This is a beautiful beach with turquoise water and sand like icing sugar. You get offered loungers and a brolly the moment you arrive. There are also plenty beach bars for drinks and food as well as toilets and souvenir shops. Well worth a trip.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Soft sand and clear water make this beach beautiful. There is also shade under palm trees and umbrellas a lot of beaches don't have this. There are nice rolling waves but not too big. If you want calm snorkeling water go to Carlisle Bay.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Small waves white sand. Not overly crowded in front of hotel but at the end near the public access more people but not unpleasant. There are boats and a hobie cat you can go out in.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Easy walking access from our hotel. Chairs and umbrellas. Lovely water. Very shallow. Shops and restaurants nearby. No one hustles you on the beach. Very calming. Showers to rinse off were nice.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,I am sick of reding negative reviews if you don't like the island and hotels glad I was not there the same time as you!
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Was a lovely beach to sit people watching and have a dip when the heat got too much. $5bd each for a sun lounger.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Beautiful Nice beach. No harassment. There are water activities available you just have to ask around! We wanted a banana boat and we got it within 30 minutes. Will be back soon!
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Lots of sand palm trees and a little more wave than on the west coast. Swim and share the water with turtles and shoals of fish.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Excellent clean beautiful beach with lots of facilities. Shallow water with mini breakers seems to be a good place to learn to surf lovely for kids (big and little!)
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,White sand and cool breeze! It's not at all far from the other hotels. Great for water sports! .....................................
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Staying in The Gap so naturally walked down to Dover Beach. My friend and I had a blast! There's lots of water activities to do there as well.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Gorgeous Beach! Lots to do and it's good for walking on. Plenty hotels on the beach. Can be a bit rough at times but certain areas are quieter than others.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,You will be very shocked and will not want to leave the beach once you get there. We spent most of our days on the beach and topped up our tans very nicely. Sometimes you can also see turtles swimming. Totally amazing.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,the beach that streches a long the south coast is one of the finest in the Caribbean if you go to Bridgetown' this is the centre of the island life we went to Harrisonn' cave which is under ground caverns with spectacular stalacites satlagmites
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,This beach is lovely! However it can get a build up of seaweed and the current is strong here...so exercise some common sense. Otherwise...it is gorgeous.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Easy access to beach and good food.. Taxi cabs are readily available to take you to popular tourist attractions at a reasonable price. Good nightlife within walking distance.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Clear water can be a bit rough but some of the bluest clearest waters I've seen on the island. Definitely worth an early morning snorkel!
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Turquoise blue waters. Sandy bottom on the left side of the beach (if facing water). Beach chairs for rent. Several bars and restaurants nearby on the Gap. If you don't have your own car to visit the many other excellent beaches in Barbados Dover beach is the one to take public transport to that should cover all of your needs.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Great beach was not very busy when we were there. We spent most days on this beach just chilling on the white sand and watching the waves. Very warm tropical water and amazing to swim in!

g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,When you arrive on Dover Beach walk to the right hand side Charles is very accommodating with 2 sunbeds and one brolly at only BDS 20.00! Great value Charles will also provide you with any drinks you require.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Nice beach a little to rough to swim. Plenty of space to stroll along and sun loungers for hire or you could just use towel. Nice place.

g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Lots of Restaurants offering ok food. Nothing memorable. Service in several restaurants was hit and miss. They were all polite but didn't really care.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Love it so much I'm back again after only being here in November 2013 for my first time. We stayed at the Sapphire Condos both times. The beachfront convenience is simply divine. The waves are beautiful. The locals are incredible. If I could own property here I would in a heartbeat.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,good value for money! with nice hotel staff dont be put off by some reviews! a great base to visit beautiful barbados!
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,we saw turtles swimming a few meters away from us. Clean and calm waters. An amazing beach great for swimming and long beach walks
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Dover Beach is a gem - the beach sand is soft (like corn starch!) and the water is wonderful and warm. Chairs available to rent as are water activities ranging from tubing jet skis boogie boards snorkel gear. Relaxing and surprisingly not that busy (even on a Sunday).
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,I love this beach. Quite calm considering its location on the south coast and no end to the beauty. Be sure to rent an umbrella since this beach is not particularly shaded
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,The water here was absolutely phenomenal! There are beach chairs and umbrellas available for rental here as well. With a bar and various food places around all you need to worry about is the sunblock! Perfect picturesque Caribbean water couldn't ask for more.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,We visited many beaches on the island and found that this one was especially great for water activities. We rented seadoos from Charles Water Sports but there was also kayaking sailing snorkeling and paddle boarding all available at this beach. Swimming was good too clear waters and the waives not too big.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,This is a lovely beach with good watersports courtesy of Charles. Lots of places to each and drink and you can get drinks served to you while you sunbathe. What more do you need. See you next year. Chrissie and pete

g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,The beach was clean and tidy you could watch the fishing boats coming in with their catch. The highlight was swimming with the Turtles that were situated in the bay area the water was clear as tap water. The staff in charge of the sun beds was very helpful and a real joy to see each day.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,gorgeous white sand and turquoise sea with maybe a turtle or two if you're lucky Happy Hour available in many beach bars along with snacks windsurfing lessons and jet ski hire if you want extra fun.

g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,It's a nice and mostly clean beach with a swimming area by the reef. The current can be quite strong so swimming is best done near the public area with the life guard tower. Sometimes there are jet skis in the area but it's not a crazy annoyance.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,

g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Smashing bootiful blue sea white golden sands Charles' Watersports where you get beds n brollys 10 bajan dollar for the day is nothing and the food @ the surrounding outlets are to die for.....We ate predominantly 'Streetfood'......stunning
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Like all of the beaches on Barbados this is clean and very family friendly Not great for swimming as the sea is quite rough along the south coast but good for wave jumping. Good facilities locally
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Great Beach clean and the water is beautiful and clear. Choice of lots of beds and umbrellas - see Kenny if you go there his beds are to the left. Watch the turtles swimming in the surf at the right hand side of the beach near the rocks.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Loved the large area of soft white sand and the many trees lining the back of the beach. The sea is really rough and not suitable for swimmingsailingsnorkelling etc.Body boarding can be enjoyed on some days
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,This is a beautiful beautiful beach as everyone kept saying  and just outside the Gap area but can walk to restaurants in the Gap. Never too busy lovely sand beach bar hamburgs fish etc at hand. Stay away from The Gap and Rockley.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Sea quite lively for young children or non swimmers great for surfing we were not bothered by beach sellers at all very relaxing
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,waves perfect for surfing beginners white sand crystal water you can get an umbrella with beds for like 5 US Dollars :) go for it!
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Dover beach has the best calming waters & great location to lime for the island breeze. You can also get the best Margaritas made with fresh Mangoes as well as island delicatessens.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Barbados is nothing but stunning beaches but this is one of the best. Shallow easy swimming and beautiful soft white sand. There are lots of food stands and beers are cheap. You can rent chairs and umbrellas for a very low price. It's also a nice stroll along the long crescent of Dover Beach.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,I didn't swim on this beach because of the strong waves and streams specially if you have kids. The beach itself is nicem with trees and rocks... I prefered west coast beaches with flat water.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,The water is a bit rough but if you walk down the beach there are calmer spots. Not too much shade but the hotels do have beach chairs with umbrellas.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Great beach for swimming with some smallish waves which were fun. No rocks and easy for kids as well.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Dover beach has to be the quintessential Caribbean beach: white sand turquoise sea palm trees. It's superb. The only downside is that at times the only safe swimming area is at the eastern end of the beach because the currents and undertow in front of Southern Palms hotel can make swimming in that area dangerous.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,We stayed at the end of St Lawrence Gap and spent most of our days on Dover Beach. The beach is kept clean and there are always plenty of sunbeds available. The sea is shallow for a long way out and there were plenty of youngsters enjoying the water.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Dover was in a good south central location. Good sized beach bar and restaurant beach chairs and umbrellas available
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,

g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Great beach on south of the island offering shelter from the Atlantic for good safe bathing white sand & palm trees - what more do you want? Plenty of beach hotel bars street bars & all the water sports.

g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,There was once in Barbados one of the finest beach of all Caribbean...nowdays there is a concentrate of beach umbrella in three rows you can hardly see the ocean...terrible!
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Clean turquoise waters white sands  clean environment and right by the GAP...near all the shops restos bars clubs and action. Good snorkeling off this beach...pretty calm waters as well.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,This is one of the best beaches we visited. The beach is amazing the views are spectacular and the type of people on the beach are really nice it isn't overcrowded and there are some great lunch places to eat nearby too.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Great Beach all along the stretch we stayed outside our hotel section of beach and caught the sun rays peacefully.lovely sand and surf there is surfing and bodyboarding available further down the beach there are sunbeds for hire great location however we were advised by our hotel and rep not to buy from anybody who approaches you on the beach
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Charles Water Sports is a great place to rent some chairs from and grab some smoothies while you bask in the sun... its a beautiful spot for a morning swim at 6:00am
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,So nice cute little bars food joints and shops. Well situated well kept and very clean. Not too busy but good service beach chairs and umbrellas readily available..
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,fab beach just across the road. Beds are 10 bajan per day. Nice and relaxing. White sand and blue sea with good waves so not flat and boring
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Big surf. Lifeguards on duty. Very safe. No hassle from vendors. Surf would be daunting for small children.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,We mainly spend our time on Dover Beach just front of Sandals Barbados property. It's a nice stretch of the beach. White & smooth sand nice clear water even if the waves could be quite "wavy"/rough. Actually we enjoyed the waves. My husband bodysurf all week.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Lovely sand but eateries leave a lot to be desired also parts of beach could do with a good clean up!
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Fantastic wide sandy beach which never felt crowded. The sea is a little choppy thoughbut great for surfing. There are water sports available and plenty of sun loungers a lovely breeze keps you cool and there are bars and snacks available.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Nice and clean beach also lifeguard is present so some part of the beach is safe to go swimming. Sometimes strong currents.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Great beach and several food stalls out front selling cheap beer and food. Makes for a great day at the beach!
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Beautiful beach with lots of beach bars and sunbeds to be rented. Boardwalk is at it's best during sunset.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Ideal for watching surfers perfect white sand beach. but if going for a dip take a pair of swim shoes as some sharp rocks close to shore line
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,There are many eating places just minutes from the beach - spoilt for choice and Kenny who arranges the sunbeds most helpful guy.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,water was rougher here that further north but it was great to watch the surfers. Waves were quite high but the beach is nice to sit on and the little bar was good.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Lovely white sand  clear turquoise ocean and waves just enough to add some fun.Friendly staff to erect your parasol and give you 2 loungers for a cheap 20 BDS
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Just enough surf to keep the swimming interesting but as it serves as the beach for several area hotels apartments etc. it can be busy.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Dover beach might be one of the most stunningly beautiful beaches in Barbados. The colors of the water and the sand really are one of a kind. I highly recommend Dover beach on your visit
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Really enjoyed this beach second best next to Crane. As the title states it is one of the best beaches on the south side of barbados.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Sitting on the beach on the sun bed looking at the ocean and having a great time... Nice beach :). There are cafes to get food from too so you don't need to go far for refreshments.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Lovely beach good for renting a sun bed and getting surf lessons. Easy walk into the gap for lunch.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Small beach but clean and the guys that rent you the beach chairs do not push you.....everything is Mellow in Barbados! Waves are tranquil and easy to swim....you have a couple of restaurants you can stop off for lunch like Daddys (good burgers) and for 4 beers for 10 bbds you can't go wrong with that!
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,calm sea small local bars and shops by beach. beds 5 bucks plenty of beds on the beach not too many people close to bus route
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,fantastic beach spotlessly clean raked and brushed every morning water crystal clear. couldn't find anything to dislike about it.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,which is the reason for the trip right? Simply beautiful the only real “WOW” we experienced. The water could be a tad rough some days.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,This is a great beach! The only bad thing is that you have to pay for a chair if you want one. You can walk out in the water for a long way. No one will bother you for anything. There's two bars if you do want a drink.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Beach was clean safe good for sunbathing swimming and walking. Beach amenities are available. Water was not rough and pleasant for swimming.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,one of the best beaches in Barbados. turtle activity at night. water was ruff on some days and calm on others depending on the weather. reef is close enough to shore to swim out to if your a good swimmer. sand is soft and maintained well by the resorts located on it.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,This is one of the few beaches left in Barbados where it is possible to swim without being overcrowded. The facilities were very good and no hassle. Clean clear water and plenty of snorkelling opportunities. Only improvement could be to banish the jet skis!
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Beautiful sandy beach. Being on the south of the island there is a chance of a reasonable swell which makes swimming in the surf great fun. Very safe
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Its a nice beach if you're in the area. Its not as some other beaches in Barbados (some on the West are really spectacular). But if you're in the area and want a beach its a good spot to go to. Be careful of the undertow in the water.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,A typical Caribbean Beach with Palms & Coconut trees beautiful sand kept spotless by Couples staff. As in any island sea conditions can vary depending on the wind direction we had 2 days of red flags but reassured that Coastguard staff were looking after us.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,lovely sand clear water the sea is a little bit more bumpy than the west coast but the light breeze is lovely
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Really enjoyed the beach - very clean and beautiful white sand. The waves could be a bit rough at times so you do have to be careful .
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,I just love this beach. The water is crystal clear and very warm. I can't wait to return. There are activities on the beach. You an go surfing sailing etc
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,It is a hard task but someone has to do it! Walking along the white sand and the warm water washing over your feet. what more could you want?
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,This is the best beach on Barbados. White sand warm blue sea great beach bar & waterspouts. What is not to like?
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,was close to our hotel quite good but not as good as miami beach! you can visit both beaches and compare which one you would prefer.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Beautiful beach with plenty of chairs for Couples Barbados' guests but be careful with the sun - is just burning!!! Use plenty of sunblock!
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,beautiful beach great location the guardians of the chairs were rather over zealous and didn't make sense. sometimes you had to pay for a chair other times not
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,The beach is phenom! Just like the title soft sand and warm water! Love the beach! Saw turtles laying eggs and baby turtles hatching. Crabs run all over the beach... Fun time!!!
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,water is warm and the waves are awesome! GO out on the hobie cat it's a lot of fun! You may be able to see crabs and turtles on the beach.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Relax in the crisp cool clear water found at Dover Beach!! Friendly people and if you're lucky you will see turtles!!
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Perfect Beach Setting with waves just right for boogie boards sand is soft and bright white.Beach is long and wide and has facilities for restrooms & lounges umbrella's and food & Drinks.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,location staff and food a perfect meal in perfect surroundingsthe rack of lamb and lobster bisque is to die for
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,The best beach in Barbados; beautiful peaceful with facilities nearby...Bring your snorkel gear as the reefs are very close to the shore and I was able to see turtles and a variety of fish everyday I went there. Food at Jhonny Cool was also very good.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Love Dover beach now that bars are opening  beach area much improved  Johnny Cools is a favourite  great bar good food and just looking at the ocean
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,This is a beautiful beach. It is small and has white sands and the water is very clean. What more can you want in a beach?
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,The Beach and water is so beautiful. White sand and blue ocean water. I flooted for hours on the gentle waves.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,This beach looks like a picture post card at times it was a bit rough but this added to the beauty.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Very windy and rough seas but sand is lovely and white. The odd beach seller but they arent a problem.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Beds umbrellas and table provided in a flash at a beautiful sandy beach. Lots of places to eat and drink around and a lovely clothes shop where a lady made a little dress for my grand daughter to order. I don't normally like to swim in the sea but this was too tempting and I enjoyed several cooling swims.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Pure white sand! Crystal clear warm water! Lots of room! The hotel provided padded lounges and umbrellas. The staff at our hotel there was attentive and friendly!
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Clean beautiful beach with calm waves. At least in low season you have more than enough space for yourself here.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Loved the beach and the setting and the warm sea. My yooungest son enjoyed swimming and my son in law the jet skies ( even though we did say at £35 for 20mins for very expensive)
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,There wasnt anything that i disliked about this hotel friendly staff security on a night loved it
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,lovely beach however the vendors can be a pain sometimes a polite no thank you does the trick and they will leave you alone
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,I liked the white sands  warm waters. I can't complain. Since I'm from the Caribbean I have to say the only downer is the humidity.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,No snorkelling recommended as there is a lot of Jetskis and no swimming only area. Ocean could be very choppy and so swimming not always allowed (red flag).
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Gogeous white sand and blue sea. Plenty of sun loungers. Sea can be a little rough but perfect for wind surfing or body boarding. Water sports available like jet skiing if required.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Joe Cool's is Cool. His bar is tucked away on the right as you look out over Dover beach. Good shade always busy with locals and tourists. Service is great. A good place to laze away an afternoon with shade and cold beer in a busy place - gets you out of the hotel if you need encouragement!
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Great beach especially for kids as it tends to be shallower than others along the coast. Great Beach patrol guy Kenny. Beds cheaper here too $20 for two beds and an umbrella other beaches are $30/40. Crystal clear waters with clean sands.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,The vibe of this beach is a nice backdrop to the clubs and restaurants in the St Lawrence Gap. One of my favorites.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,The most beautiful beach I have seen and I have been to many countries but nothing compare to this. Long white sandy beach and never crowded your own little bit of paradise x
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Beach was great too rough too snorkel though. Sea turtle tour was great as was harrison caves. No pressure selling vendors like most tourist places
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,We spent most days on the south end of Dover beach. Generally quiet part from when the surf school were in the water but even that didn't detract from the general peace and tranquility.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Beautiful Beach a must see in Barbados! Pink sand from the coral reef! We went snorkeling over the ship wrecks and were surrounded by fish in the water - truly a magical experience! We loved this beach!
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Surf can be rough at times but long shelf. Nice white sand. Limited vendors. Good breeze to keep you cool.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Amazing beach. Not very busy with clear and warm water. Much better than west coast beaches where I stayed 2 years ago
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Stalls have friendly people to grab a bite or a beer. Nice spot to surf too! Waves are not too rough but active enough for fun!
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,There are beaches everywhere in Barbados and they are all public so anyone can go anywhere. This beach was 3 blocks from where we stayed small quiet great sand beautiful crystal clear water.... And J. Cool's right on the beach has delicious mango daiquiris. Delish!
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,If you stay at Couples Barbados book this restaurant early to get a table. It takes about 2 hours for dinner so make sure you have plenty of time on your hands to relax and enjoy the food
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,One of the cleanest beaches i have seen in a long time and not over crowed either just watch the surf can be a bit rough
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Our favourite beach on the island - great to relax and stroll with some reasonable eateries for drinks and snacks to hand
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Not far from the gap and free. Very clean with several lounge chairs though you have to pay for them
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Eddie was the skipper and we (all 32 of us) went on a private charter cruise with music free food and drink swimming with the turtles it was the best day of the holiday for most of us.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Less waves here and a short walk from nearby hotels. Great for if you don't want to deal with the big waves.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Windy and a lot of waves. That doesn't both me but if you don't like sand all over you won't like it.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,The water was super blue but almost too rough to swim or relax. You need to be a strong swimmer in order to go out in the ocean.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,offers free beach chairs and shaded area. Great beach bar with good food which was reasonably priced. Trythe flying fish!!
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,All beaches in Barbados are clean and beautiful and because they are all public anyone can go on them wherever they are.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,The sand is soft and white. The beach is large enough for a good walk. Sunrises are gorgeous! We were amazed at how clean the beach was - almost no litter. We saw baby turtles in the early morning hours!
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,An amazing beach during the day and a great place to watch the sun go down! Litter a bit of an issue but overall - brilliant!
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Nice sand $10BD for two lounges and an umbrella for the day. Calm water and no rocks. Stroll up to da shack for 3 banks beers for $5 and a grilled chicken sandwich then another plunge in the sea a few pages in your book and a quick nap....heaven.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,You'll be sure to enjoy this beach. Soft white sand and turquoise water is what you'll enjoy! Be sure to visit Dover Beach when in St. Lawrence Gap Barbados!
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Deep soft sand with the texture of icing sugar. Calmer than other beaches with shallow entrance to a nice reef on south side. Good for snorkelling.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Located near a very prime location of St. Lawrence Gap. Lots of shacks for food and drinks boutique shops many guesthouses all reasonably priced. If you are looking for fancy hotels to stay and eat you can find those as well. In all a great location to enjoy sea sand and sun in your own way!
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Crowded beach and smallish swimming area within the flags but still better than I expected and very easy access.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,We liked this beach as it had a choice of shacks serving good food and drinks reasonably priced. Also local food vendor selling home cooked foods. Fruit stall. Bus stop right at the beach too.Everyone we met was really helpful

g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Excellent sand you had your choice of quiet spots good for bodyboarding not for swimming or opportunities to snorkel
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Archtypal caribbean beach - white sand clear blue sea. Beach bars close by - De Shack is the best. 3 sunbeds 1 umbrella BD$25 (£8) discounted to BD$20 (£7) after a few days for being loyal customers (!). Beers BD$10 for 4 (£3) and Flying Fish Sandwiches BD$10 at both De Sahck and Daddy's Bar. Great value.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,It was practically across the road from the hotel; clean and beautiful! The only thing is purchasing drinks or food on the beach is pretty expensive so I advise if on a budget you can probably walk with your drinks and food.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Clean beach deep soft sand friendly people and not crowded with tourists. Warm water small waves.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,long and sandy quite breezy so have to be careful of getting slightly burnt. Quite a stong undercurrent so not ideal for swimming. But still a lovely beach
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Nice beach quiet spot to just completely relax. Again the people of Barbados need to give lessons to the other islands! Lots of locals around but not one bothered us to buy anything etc etc. perfect beach and a great day
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Super beach lots of waves perhaps too rough for some but I loved it lots of shade if you wanted it. Very safe as well never any problems a great place to chill out.

g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Next to the St Lawrence Gap. Nice and cheap places to eat. We rented a paddle board and caught some waves. Pretty chill beach
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,White sand clear blue water. You can't really lounge and float because of the waves. Can't surf because the waves aren't big enough. But vibe is chill there's a couple bars to grab a drink and there is a nice volleyball net there as well.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Perfect size beautiful fine golden sand not too busy constant breeze and good for both swimming and body boarding.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Local bars and restaurants. Easy walking distance Local supermarket for self catering drinks etc. bus service into Oistens Bridgetown etc very colourful
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Really beautiful and calm beach would be great to take the kids. Other beaches I went to in Barbados can be a bit rough.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,This beach is very laid back. Only $20 Barbados ($10us) for two chairs and the umbrella. What a great deal...soft white sand and warm water. Go here if you stay in the Gap.....
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,It s one nice beach in the south coast. You can be accomodate with chairs and umbrellas by Kenny which is always ready to help you. Showers are available and few many places where to have a snack. Just a dark cloud about the jet skis that sometimes are too close.....
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Loved the beach and the beautiful water! Just becareful and pay attention to the red flag but the other beaches to the west are more suitable for swimming and enjoying.

g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,I spent 4 wonderful days relaxing on and around Dover beach. With its lovely white sand and dozens of deck chairs and umbrellas available it was the perfect place to unwind. A dozen or so food places and bars selling the local beer at 2 beers for under £2 what's not to like?

g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Quiet peaceful beach. Nice cafe at one end. We didn't want drinks and the very kind attentive waitress gave us water....no charge!!!
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Excellent beach for taking it easy walking on the beach swimming and relaxing. You can also spot turtles in front of the pink colored hotel.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Lovely beach white sand great for body boarding. You can get some really cheap food from the beach shacks on the beach.

g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,really bad fast food out lets. packed beach and badly maintained approaching roads.ramshackle shacks serving battered fat filled food with no ambience. How Butlins used to be only with better weather and sea.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Don't leave Barbados without taking a trip on Michael's boat. Can't recommend this guy enough. Fabulous trip out to swim with the turtles and snorkel over ship wrecks. You will find him wandering the beach or his little boat moored off shore. Thanks Michael or a great trip much better than any larger boat trip.

g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,South coast sandy beach. Calm shallow waters but we were told it fan get rough. Clos to many beachside bars and restaurants. Usually quiet.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Dover beach is beautiful though waves can be rough! There are life guards on the beach at all times. Plenty to do on the beach hobiecats jet skis canoes etc
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,Im not a beach person but my friends and i had a wonderful time dover beach has a lot of little beach bars u can choose from little shopsmini marts night clubs and by the way St.Lawrence gap leads to Dover beach its very exciting for me who loves night life
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,our hotel was straight on to this beach at dover beach.infinity hotel. not really enough beds and brollies as it got quite busy over xmas week.but managed usually to get one.also beware when bathing here in sea as my partner nearly drowned due to very strong currents.had to be rescued by the life guardand hadnt gone out very far either.
g666621,d4053401,February 8 2016,We stayed at the Infinity hotel which is right on this beach. Although a bit rough at times I still swam for hours in the water. No rocks in the sand at all. There are small huts right off the beach where you can get food and drinks. You can also do some water sports here which is great.
